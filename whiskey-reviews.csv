0,1792 Port Finish Bourbon ,"[': Grape juice and grape jam, on a bed of sweet corn and caramel. Quite sweet. After a rest in the glass, a tart top note – like cranberry – creeps in.', ': A tad hot for ~44%. ', ': Short. Oaky, but not tannic. Echoes of sweet grape jam and semisweet chocolate. Fades quickly.', ': Water brings a little more nose tickle to the aroma, without revealing anything new. The palate is a little softer. I suggest adding a touch of water and then letting it rest in the glass for a few minutes to reawaken the aroma.', ': Not quite as supple and polished as ']"
1,1792 Ridgemont Reserve Bourbon ,"[': Salted caramels. Nougat. Mild oak, lightly sweet. Hint of acetone. Not exactly a “study it over the course of an evening” type of aroma, but simple and sweet.', ': Silky, medium-bodied. Oaky up front, and a bit hot at first. Then, nougat-y taffy and rich corn. The corn here is syrupy and round, and not plastic or industrial.', ': Medium-long. Nut skins, light caramel, fading with a bit of charcoal. Not bitter.', ': A splash of water adds a vegetal note to the nose – like raw green split firewood. It utterly removes the tongue burn, but at the expense of some flavor. Water (or ice) is optional with this one, when drinking straight up.', ': I wouldn’t exactly buy a bottle of this for exclusive sipping. However, it makes a graceful, easygoing dram AND a top-notch cocktail, which makes it the golden intersection of value bourbon for me. It has none of the aspects of cheap bourbon that always put me off – the over-oaked bitterness, the rough, high-octane grainy alcohol, the acetone (well maybe a bit), or the fake-candy high-fructose corn syrup flavor. It’s just straightforward, sweet, silky, and mixes flawlessly into an Old Fashioned or a bourbon Manhattan. Alas, it’s more expensive than VOB so it doesn’t win any “value” awards. If you can get VOB, leave this one in the dust. If you can’t, 1792 Ridgemont Reserve is an acceptable substitute.']"
2,8 Seconds (Sec8nds) Canadian Whisky ,"[': Sweet. Soft, melty, buttery caramel. And… yeah that’s it.', ': Soft texture. Thankfully not ultra-sweet, although the overall impression is of cake-y baked goods. German chocolate cake frosting?', ': Short. Brown sugar melting away to reveal a core of pretty young, grassy grain whisky. Ends with straight vodka notes.', ': Dampens the aroma. No effect on the palate, maybe turns up the vegetal notes on the finish.', ': This is the first “blended Canadian whisky” that I’ve had (ever) that doesn’t make me want to wash my mouth out. That said, it desperately calls for ice and a bitter or acidic ingredient to balance the inherent sweetness. I would wager that if you wanted to make a cocktail that called for ']"

7,Aberlour (12 year) ,"[': Fruity with a ton of red grapefruit, cape gooseberry, kiwi, and decadent refined honey. Very floral as well, with a heady cloud of lemon verbena and honeysuckle. All of the fruits seem fresh and tart as opposed to the usual Aberlour dark red and black fruits. This is downright summery.', ': Syrupy body. Honey again, with almost no tongue burn at all. Dried apricots and golden figs replace the tart fruits from the aroma. There is a faint layer of oakiness, mostly with notes of cinnamon and vanilla.', ': Medium-short. The finish is a little muddled. The fruit notes are not clear, and the spicy oak notes are now marred with slightly acrid bitterness. Ends somewhat quickly, without evolving. This situation improves with further sips, which build up a little more sweetness to balance the bitterness.', ': A few drops of water mix up the fruits and flowers on the aroma – making them harder to place. The palate seems thinner, but the finish has more fruit. I would probably skip the water, since I liked the aroma so much in the first place.', ': Despite the low ABV, I would not call this watery or lacking in potency. The aroma is lovely and deeply perfumed, the palate competent and well-composed, but the finish is an outright disappointment. That said, the price is dead on and I don’t feel like the 40% ABV is unduly low in this case. I do think ']"

10,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 41) ,"[': Coffee grounds and balsamic reduction. Dark chocolate nibs. Black cherry. Much darker notes and less fresh or red fruit than previous batches, but arguably more interesting.', ': Familiar mouth-puckering raspberry sour, dark oak, drying tannin, and strawberry. Just like old times.', ': Very long, with raisin and resin. Mouth-drying tannins. The fruit here is dried and concentrated and doused in sticky caramelized sugar. Ends with some faint marshmallow (from the oak influence).', ': Slightly lighter fruits; brings out strawberry in the nose. Reveals balsamic vinegar on the palate, and somewhat tames the burn.', ': Not as much of a sherry bomb as previous batches, but more complex and brooding. Still burns like sweet, sweet fire. The price is not as approachable as days gone by, but $60 for a fantastic sherried cask-strength whisky is still not a bad deal. I continue to recommend this malt highly.']"
11,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 57) ,"[': Deeply raisiny, with more rancio and balsamic than prior batches. STRONG nose tickle – need to keep nose out of the glass. Smells drier – less fresh/vibrant fruit and more oakiness and dried fruit. Deep in the glass – if you dare – there is a layer of unctuous gooey caramel and fudge brownie.', ': Syrupy body. Salted caramel, and… OH GOD IT BURNS. Ok… once that’s out of the way, the seared remnants of my tongue pick up deep sugary oak (maple syrup but not maple), dusty dried prunes and raisins, faint fig jam, sawdust, and birch beer.', ': A layer of sooty charcoal that resolves into mouth-drying tannins, cocoa nibs, and an odd absence of fruit. Further sips confirm – lots of chocolate and oak, no fruit. Weird.', ': Several drops of water amps up the nose tickle, but also sweetens the aroma, adding fudgy frosting and a touch more fruit. It still burns like fire on the tongue, but the few fruit notes are brighter – more jelly than jam. The finish picks up a nice apple/cinnamon note, and isn’t quite as dry. This batch benefits immensely from water. At this ABV you could probably use splashes instead of drops, but taste as you go.', ': I have to say, as much as I love A’Bunadh, this is not my favorite batch. I’m a sucker for big, fresh fruit in my sherried drams, or heavily jammy/concentrated fruit flavors. This has neither. Although the chocolate notes are welcome, and the flavor is as powerful and dense as always, the whole comes across as drier, woodier, and with less fruit than usual. Reminds me more of a mid-aged (~15 yr) ']"
12,Aberlour Casg Annamh (Batch 1) ,"[': Balsam and juniper berry strike the nose first, but the aroma is shy and seems to require a rest in the glass. After said rest there is mild sweet grape jam, cherry ', ': Syrupy body. A moderate tongue burn is followed by sugar cookie dough, ', ': Medium-short. Some charcoal bitterness, flecked with root beer and powdered cinnamon. Little fruit. Fades without much fanfare, leaving a bit of menthol.', ': A few drops of water bring out a distinct fresh hay note in the aroma, but not much else. The palate is cleaner with some licorice, the finish rounder. Water doesn’t hurt, but it also doesn’t fix what’s wrong here.', ': I’m not used to Aberlour being shy, and to add insult to injury this is no sherry bomb. This seems to be an unsuccessful merging of sherried and ex-bourbon styles where the best elements of each is squashed by the presence of the other. The notes that I can detect are fleeting and inconsistent. I could imagine that midway through a full bottle of this, one would come to appreciate its core complexity… but a sample is insufficient to do it justice. I am left without much desire to find a full bottle, especially when A’bunadh and ']"
13,Alberta Rye Dark Batch Canadian Whisky ,"[': A robust – dare I say, “bold”? – aroma of fungal wine caves, sweet fortified wine (duh), and soft, sweet, round Canadian “rye”. More fun than serious, this smells like a glass of something a bunch of drunk whisky people would mix together after a particularly long cask-strength tasting. You can tell there’s sherry (as opposed to sherry cask-aged whisky) in here, because the aromas are winey and with a dense, fresh, watery fruit note that one does not normally find in whisky. If you think of this like a bottled cocktail, the effect is quite pleasant, and very well-integrated.', ': Syrupy body. Black raisins, pine resin, soft wheat, and red wine dregs. After the initial (very tame) tongue burn, there is some malty cereal sweetness like marshmallows and coconut shavings.', ': Long-ish. The sherry pervades, with raisins, resinous sappy wood, and the barest reminder that this is rye: cloves. Fades without bitterness.', ': A few drops of water bring very sweet melted vanilla ice cream to the nose, along with a heightened sense of rye spice (cinnamon, primarily). muting the “wet” sherry notes. The palate is downright “smooth” (aka doesn’t burn) with a little water, but no new notes appear. Water is fully optional here.', ': I think the best way to think of Dark Batch is as a bottled cocktail, and a damn good one at that. A masterful balance of dark, resinous sherry with your typical round, sweet Canadian rye. At a very reasonable price, this is something that could form a tasty, satisfying drink neat, or as a component in some unique cocktails. In fact, it’s quite pleasant by itself on ice.']"
14,Alchemist: The Macallan (15 year) ,[]
15,Alexander Murray Bon Accord ,"[': Smells like a blend (it’s not). White peach, stale hay, green apple. Some banana after a rest in the glass. The rest also adds an aroma of fresh laundry, but also a sense of watery blandness that suggests a lack of potency.', ': Silky mouthfeel. Very light tongue burn. Bananas foster up front, with mild sweetness and a nice round cereal note. Pleasant, if unremarkable. Forgettable, even.', ': Short. Caramel, and then a fading hint of black licorice. Some slight oaky bitterness.', ': A scant few drops of water wake up the nose a little with some extra alcohol tickle, but no additional aromas. The mouthfeel is unaffected, as is the flavor. The finish might have picked up a fruity twang. Water neither helps nor hurts here, which is actually good news for those looking to drink theirs on the rocks.', ': A middle-of-the-road, middling malt without much to say for itself. It’s not bad, but it doesn’t exactly jump out of the glass either. It’s priced correctly under $30, but nothing about it justifies purchasing it over other options in that range. I do wish it were bottled at 46% ABV.']"
16,Alexander Murray: Mortlach (16 year) 1995 – 2011 ,"[': Tannic, slightly acidic oak. Something tart, like apple cider vinegar, meets the nose first, and further digging is necessary to find the meaty/fruity notes that Mortlach is known for. Deeper in the glass I find dried apple slices, fresh hay, and a faint charry smokiness. Butterscotch makes an appearance, but the overall aroma is not sweet.', ': Texturally heavy, not quite oily. First, there is a pleasant wave of toasty grains and cashew butter, followed by more dried apple and dusty orange peel.', ': Warming; medium length. Roasted nuts, spun sugar, fading without bitterness.', ': Several drops of water seem to wash out the aroma, leaving only faint hay. The palate becomes thinner and acquires only a waxy/glue note. The finish, however, is a little fruitier. I’d skip the water here. At 40% ABV, it certainly doesn’t need it.', ': While it pales in a side-to-side comparison with classical sherry-aged ']"

20,Amrut Portonova ,"[': Piercing nose – a sour top note like key limes over a layer of round, plummy sweetness. Lots of port character – ruby berries, plump black raisins, resiny brandy. Underneath there is a hint of banana sorbet, but distinctly different from other Amruts.', ': There’s the Amrut banana upfront. Sweet and just off cloying. There is moderate tongue burn, followed by sweet-and-sour mix, cinnamon raisin toast, sticky prunes, banana nut bread and raspberry jam. Viscous mouthfeel: syrupy but not oily or thick.', ': Subtle, but long. Leaves behind a sherry-like cherry syrup, drying oak, and some vague savoriness/meatiness. A bit muddled.', ': The nose is something unique. That sour high note combined with a sea of dark fruits and rich layers of port make an uncanny but delicious combination. I’m not sure where the sour lime note comes from – it’s not something I associate with port – but it carries through on the tongue. The finish is a little bit vague, with most of the exciting flavors dried up and only the wood and some remnant plummy notes left. But the nose… I could sit and smell this all day.', ': The sour note I mentioned is amplified by the addition of water. It reveals notes of green banana, sweet pea, and toffee in the nose. On the tongue, the whisky becomes sweeter and the burn is very much diminished. The finish, also, is somewhat clarified, with more green fruits and some golden raisin. I definitely suggest trying this with a very small amount of water.']"

26,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2014) ,"[': Hot (strong alcohol fumes). Ruby port, grapefruit, honeycomb, and a deep, round woodiness. Under the blanket of alcohol, there’s roasted chestnuts, cherry cordial, and charcoal. There actually isn’t as much fruit on the nose as I expected. After a few minutes of rest in the glass, it develops an awesome, heady vanilla buttercream frosting aroma. Really – wow.', ': Moderate tongue-burn. Barrel tannins are immediately apparent, and then blackberry jam, butterscotch, and cherry ice cream.', ': Long and warming. A nice, tart wave of mixed berries fades into spun sugar, which becomes burnt caramel and then charcoal. Never bitter.', ': A few drops of water increase the vanilla frosting note in the aroma, and might be making the flavor and finish nuttier. A more aggressive watering (to around 40% ABV) yields unripe berries and kiwi on the nose. Seriously, kiwi. However, this makes it slightly anemic (at least in comparison to full strength) on the tongue. I’d shoot for around 50% ABV if you want to tame the fire.', ': I definitely suggest letting this open up in the glass for a few minutes – you want that initial nuclear mushroom-cloud of alcohol to dissipate and that head of vanilla frosting to develop before nosing. As with other Angel’s Envy releases, you can count on the bourbon component to complement (not overwhelm) the port finish. However, the high proof of this release amps both up, so that intense berry/fruit flavors compete with concentrated oak and corn syrup flavors. While the flagship Angel’s Envy pairs easy-sipping, soft, subtle bourbon with port wood, at cask strength the mixture is much denser and loses some of that subtlety. You’re best off tasting this at full proof (after the rest), and then watering it down to around 50% to get the best of both worlds. I think it’s an excellent whisky, and really shows what Angel’s Envy is capable of. I can’t love the price point, however, no matter how carefully hand-picked the casks are.']"
27,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2015) ,"[': Candy corn, fresh juicy peaches, dried apple slices. A little deeper in there’s creamed corn, fresh hay, and a deep, heavy, buttery oakiness. The sweet/sugary notes are minor, mostly burnt caramel and a hint of maple sugar. After a rest in the glass, the aroma is heavy with bright, vivid fruit punch.', ': Hot. So very hot! Untempered, that 64% ABV is some serious business. After the flames die down and your eyes stop watering, there is sparkly ground cinnamon, fresh snappy red apples, cinnamon red-hots, and a light non-cloying general sweetness, like a light brown sugar glaze.', ': Medium-long. Slightly bitter oaky tannins only at first and then a few passing tart notes (red plums, lemon peel) and a mouth-coating Red Delicious apple skin note that hangs on for quite awhile at the end.', ': A small splash of water brings out a little more sweetness on the nose (caramel/butterscotch), but at the cost of some of the intensity of the other notes. The palate is much more friendly, with pleasant fruit notes co-mingling with light oak and toffee. The finish is unchanged. I highly recommend some water with this (if you have a whole bottle, also try watering a small glass down to around 46% and see how different it is) unless you think you can handle the burn of a sip at cask strength, which has the benefit of more intense flavors all around.', ': This is a damn tasty whiskey. What I’ve always liked about Angel’s Envy is its ability to transcend the bourbon clichés and deliver both subtlety and complexity in a way that other, heavier bourbons just can’t. At cask strength, you have an iron fist in a velvet glove – those same subtle, complex elements are thrust in your face and burned onto your tongue, for better or for worse. Priced at or above $160, it’s your decision whether that sounds enticing enough to justify that chunk of change. For me, it’s a reserved “Must Try” (good luck!).']"
28,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2016) ,"[': Approach with caution. At this proof, it will crawl right up your nose and burn your sinuses! Furniture lacquer, blueberry jam, espresso, bright red candied apples, black cherry lozenges, and black pepper. Deep, dark, and pungent.', ': An initial wave of cassis is burned out by a gout of hellfire that anesthetizes the tongue (you’d think I’d be used to cask strength whiskies by now…) Under anesthesia, the taste buds can make out blackberry preserves, toffee, espresso, charcoal, and a rough, oaky sweetness.', ': Medium-short, but confused. Upfront there is bitter charcoal and charred toast, which fades quickly into tannic red grape skins. Quite dry.', ': A big splash of water helps quench the fires, and allows me to detect a few additional notes: marshmallow, mixed berries, and licorice on the palate. Water is nearly a necessity here to make it drinkable, but you might brave a first sip or two without, to get the full blast of concentrated 124 proof flavor.', ': As usual, Angel’s Envy cask strength brings a wealth of intense flavor at a tongue-searing proof. You pay for the robust, dense flavors of berries and complex caramelized sugars in dead taste buds and the inability to smell for a few hours after. By all means, proof it down, but you might as well experience the full force of the 124.6 proof that you paid for. And paid well, I should add, at around $180. For that kind of money, this can only be a special-edition splurge.']"
29,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2017) ,"[': A gentle waft of juicy red grapes and berry jam greets the nose. The fruits are redder and fresher than the 2016 edition. Beneath the fruit is a layer of varnish and dark oak. The lacquer note from last year is muted and seems to convey a sweeter wood-sugar note. There is also more marzipan (almond extract) than usual. Neither glass emits much in the way of grain spices. A rest in the glass adds a welcome blanket of vanilla frosting. It’s worth letting this open up a little (20-30 minutes). Both vintages are powerful: don’t get your nose too deep in the glass or you risk burning out your sense of smell for awhile.', ': On fire out of the gate: A cascade of searing inferno washes over my tongue, raping and pillaging before settling into a dull, numb ache. The few surviving tastebuds register dense blackberry jam, toffee, espresso, and oaky tannins before giving up the ghost. You may as well give this a taste at full strength to prove your bravado. Then give your mouth an hour or two to recover and water the rest down sufficiently to taste. The 2016 edition had more chewy dried fruits and taffy notes, as well as more caramelized sugars.', ': Long. Residual fresh red fruits (fruit punch) and cinnamon-spiced mulled wine linger for awhile, fading with peppery, mouth-drying tannins and blackberry seeds (you know, the ones stuck in your teeth after a few blackberries, which taste woody when you find them). The 2016 edition was more incoherent, and shorter.', ': At last! A healthy splash (or two) of water temporarily mutes the fresh fruit aroma but also sweetens both the nose and palate. The bourbon’s complexity and woody sweetness are more apparent when you can actually taste them. This is one cask-strength bourbon that I like even better at a drinking strength (50% ish ABV). You’ll need a lot of water to truly take away the fire. Note that if your personal ethics rebel at the idea of adding water to expensive cask-strength whisky, taking a big glug of water immediately before and immediately after each taste of whiskey can help.', ': First, is it better than the 2016 edition, which I recommended? Yes, I think so. It lacks a little of that caramelized depth that is reserved for older and more-concentrated bourbons, but more than makes up for it with polish, coherency, and intensely fresh-tasting fruit notes. For that reason, this whisky’s 2017 edition is still recommended, but only if the $200 price tag (and second $20 increase in two years) doesn’t faze you. It certainly fazes me: I wouldn’t have purchased a bottle at $179 and I will continue to not purchase a bottle at $199. All that said, there is no denying that this is an exceptional bourbon, from exceptionally well-chosen barrels, and adeptly finished.']"
30,Angel’s Envy Rye ,"[': Spicy! Assorted baking spices (clove, cinnamon, etc.), with a deep undercurrent of molasses. The rum character is evident with fresh cane juice, coconut, and a very heavy caramelized sugar note. Something vegetal as well – root beer? Sweetness and spice alternate for dominance in the nose. Very robust.', ': Mulled cider, black pepper, caramels. Molasses again – here the rum is even more clear. Tastes almost like blackstrap rum. At 50% ABV, the burn is present, but the sweetness compensates nicely. A lot of flavor here.', ': Quite long. Crystallized ginger, cloves, and burnt sugar on the fade-out. The burnt sugar note gets a little too acrid for me, but another sip takes care of that. 🙂', ': A few drops of water release a wave of black licorice and cake frosting. The same appear on the palate. This definitely benefits from just a little bit of water.', ': This is a spice bomb and no joke. All of the usual rye character is present, in spades, with a healthy layer of caramelized sugary rum. The interplay is as natural as spices in cider, or brown sugar in spice cake. The bottling proof was a good choice, as everything (flavor, aroma) is amped up equally, and without numbing my tongue. For seven-and-a-half years old, this comes off as big and flavorful and slightly older than it is. I would have awarded a “Must Try” if the whiskey were either cheaper, or more available. I can’t love the price, or the shortages, but I can love this sample for as long as it lasts…']"
31,Ardbeg (10 year) ,"[': Pungent. A hint of lemon precedes a torrent of smoky peat. The peat is redolent of campfires, with toasted wood, charcoal, woodsmoke, and smouldering dry grass. Beneath the peat is a subtle layer of vanilla and brine.', ': Full-bodied. A tinge of sweetness greats the tongue, of pure malted grains and oaky vanilla. This is quickly obliterated by smoking hay, dry seagrass, slightly bitter charcoal, and dense, woodsy peat. While the flavors are intense, they are also very well-balanced, and the tongue burn is minimal, considering its robust 46% ABV. One could contemplate this smoky complexity for hours.', ': Very long (I will be tasting Ardbeg on my lips and tongue throughout the evening). A swath of bitterness is balanced well by a resurgence of malty, nutty grains and a strong spike of anise and black pepper. This all fades together, leaving a fugue of grassy, boggy peat and smoke.', ': A few drops of water initially mute the nose, so give the glass a few swirls and a rest before nosing again. The water seems to unbalance the alcohol burn and peat component, making the aroma sharper and more one-dimensional, although I get some buttery oak now. The palate is tamer and sweeter, but the balance still seems off. At 46%, this does not need water. I recommend keeping it neat.', ': I’m often struck by the differences between Ardbeg peat and Laphroaig peat. The former is all about smoke, and the impression is of a distant wildfire, pervading everything. The latter is all about the sea, with brine and seaweed and iodine. I can’t say which I prefer – I’m alternatively in the mood for either – and I can’t say that either is objectively better. Still, the essence of Ardbeg is control over chaos – an impressive feat considering the wild force of nature that peat becomes in the glass. Ardbeg is both masterfully constrained and wildly flavorful, the kind of whisky that makes you realize why people like smoky flavors in scotch, and also reminds you that the Scots have been perfecting this style for hundreds of years. If you haven’t had Ardbeg 10, there’s really no point in reading about it. You must experience it to complete your training, young padawan. If you aren’t sure you like peat, though, consider just buying a glass, neat, first. If you find you like peat, you cannot go wrong by owning a bottle.']"

34,Ardbeg An Oa ,"[': Unmistakably Ardbeg. Sooty smoke and malty grain sweetness in perfect balance. Vanilla, charcoal, and a very faint jam note that I’m probably forcing myself to detect because of the “PX Sherry” on the label. There is also an overt woodiness that is more obvious after your senses adjust to the smoke. ', ': Sooty (did I already say that?) with a moderate tongue burn. Campfire (oak) smoke, brown sugar, root beer, and fresh hay. Actually somewhat narrow, despite Ardbeg’s usual complexity.', ': Very long. Smoke dominates the finish, billowing and unrelenting. No seaweed or anything here, just woodsmoke and an undercurrent of cereal sugars. No sherry that I can detect, even with the power of suggestion.', ': Water has no apparent effect on the whisky. You might consider adding a little if it’s too hot for your liking, but know that it will not dilute the smokiness at all.', ': Unfortunately without a vertical of Ardbeg in front of me I can’t make a confident assessment, but I think this is much smokier than your typical ']"

36,Ardbeg Dark Cove ,"[': Potent. Fresh-cut cigars, boggy campfire, roasted cocoa nibs, and soft malty grains. A rest in the glass reveals some uncharacteristic pear notes. If I really concentrate I can identify some of the citrus (lime peel?) notes that are so redolent in Corryvreckan. I smell nothing that suggests sherry, let alone “dark sherry” – whatever that is.', ': Somewhat syrupy body. A flood of chocolate arrives on the tongue, followed by a torrent of hot (young) alcohol. The floodwaters quickly recede, leaving cayenne-spiked Mexican hot chocolate, black pepper, smoked paprika, and smoldering oak firewood.', ': Long. A little peppery, with dusty cocoa powder, ashy woodsmoke, and tobacco. My lips actually feel and taste like I’ve just finished a short cigar.', ': A few drops of water have little apparent effect on the aroma. They do bring out a little tartness on the palate, though, without diminishing it. I’d say water is optional here.', ': An odd duck. The nose is pretty much standard Ardbeg – perhaps even a little muted – almost a disappointment. But then it washes the tongue with the strongest chocolate note I’ve experienced in a whisky. The peat comes across as smoked pepper and smoky spices (paprika), which combine to create an unmistakable flavor of spicy Mexican hot chocolate. The bottling strength is appropriate, but I do wish they’d used a larger percentage of older Ardbeg to subdue some of that fiery youth on the tongue. I also wish they’d used much more of the sherry-finished liquid, as the balance could use a little punch of dried fruit.']"
37,Ardbeg Galileo ,"[': Lot of vanilla. Light brown sugar. Cereal. Very mild peat – this is Ardbeg?', ': Sharp, piquant peat. Vanilla & caramel. Hefty burn. Some wooksmoke (fruit wood – like applewood chips smoking). A little lime juice on the tail end.', ': Not too bitter. Peat shows through (finally) on finish.', ': Becomes very perfumey, like a room full of vanilla beans drying.', ': Lots of vanilla. Easy drinking, for an Ardbeg, but not much else to recommend it. I was 100% unable to identify the marsala. This is a particularly sweet, aromatic whisky with a very muted peat profile. If someone handed me a glass, I can honestly say I would enjoy drinking it. Alas, the total mistranslation of the marsala cask (I would have said this was 100% ex-bourbon), and the special-edition hoopla seriously undermined the experience for me. I would say this whisky is not worth the (exceptional) effort required to secure a bottle. (Although K&L still has ']"

A slight citrus note, but not as obvious as ', ': Long. Sherry-tinged woodsmoke, fading without bitterness.', ': A few drops of water highlight some of the citrus notes in the nose, and somewhat tame the tongue burn. The water also adds a welcome orange-peel character to the finish. Diluting down to 46% yields an easily drinkable dram with some sweet citrus, but very tame peat.

Peat only expresses itself as a low smolder. Some brown sugar.', ': Medium-long. The peat makes itself known – a nice dash of smoked almonds. There’s good balance between peat smoke and cereal sweetness – at least they didn’t try to peat the hell out of it.', ': Water adds some grassiness, but not much else.', ': This dram has the air of an experiment – someone at Arran said “hey, let’s do peat!” and so they did. It’s moderately well-balanced, but it’s neither particularly complex nor particularly exciting. It’s also been bottled far too young.

Raspberry, white tea, “cooked” malt (tastes like cooked cereal grains – like porridge – rather than fresh/raw – like… I dunno, granola?). ', ': Medium length. Honeycomb. Evolves slightly around malty/sweet/cereal flavors. Some mild oak tannin and a little charcoal bitterness. Fades classically, with walnuts and a nice marshmallow note.', ': A few drops of water don’t seem to open up the aroma much… perhaps even closing it off instead.

Water is beneficial with this dram, as long as you’re willing to be patient with it.', ': A very standard-tasting malt with no rough edges. A robust and well-chosen 47% ABV keeps it sprightly while the lowland malt keeps it sweet and unchallenging. Definitely a decent summer malt, and I wouldn’t fault anyone for putting a few ice cubes in a glass of this on a hot day. Still, the liquid doesn’t set itself apart from any ex-bourbon Highland malt in the $40 price range or even the entry-level']"
41,Auchentoshan (18 year) ,"[': Somewhat hot. Classically Auchentoshan – lots of distinct cereal grains and minimal wood. Vanilla, sugar cookies, white chocolate, and blonde fudge.', ': Nice medium body, just the right amount of tongue burn – enough to announce its presence. All of the aroma notes are repeated on the tongue.', ': On the short side. Sugar cookies and vanilla fudge continue to be a theme. On the finish, a note of nut skins creeps in, suggesting tannins, but doesn’t get bitter.', ': Water brings out a little more sweetness in both the nose and on the tongue. The effect is additive, and makes a few drops of water a good idea with this malt.', ': Auchentoshan 18 is a clean, light, elegant malt. That said, it doesn’t show a great deal of improvement over younger Auchentoshan, and seems to be aged in a way that picks up minimal wood. For some people that might be a blessing, as it showcases the purity and delicacy of the malt (something triple distillation does, as well). For me, that just means it has less flavor and less complexity. As far as the price goes, I think I prefer ']"
42,Auchentoshan American Oak ,"[': Vanilla and raw barley. Notes are very similar to Irish blended whisky. Light brown sugar and freshly-cut hardwood. A slight overripe banana note underlies the rest, and becomes more prominent as the dram rests. Clean, crisp, and light, like the ', ': Light bodied, but with a slight “simple syrup” texture. Melted vanilla ice cream, some oaky tannins, and mild toasted barley.', ': Short. Very slightly bitter, but with pleasant notes of kettle corn as it fades.', ': A few drops of water accentuate (unfortunately) the banana notes, adding green banana to the mix. Stay away from water with this one – it certainly doesn’t need it at 40% ABV.', ': As a value malt, this has a few ticks in its favor over the ']"
43,Auchentoshan Classic ,[]
44,Auchentoshan Three Wood ,"[': A powerful blossom of sherry greets the nose. Nutty, with plenty of dried fruits (predominantly fig). Some nice acidity comes through – like cranberry, or red wine vinegar – and a bit of caramelized sugar. Overall, the impression is of a mid-aged heavily sherried malt where the sherry is doing all of the work.', ': Viscous body, heavy with notes of balsamic reduction, fig paste, dark chocolate, and hazelnuts. Very appealing.', ': On the short side. Tarry molasses and override plums. A little minty. While the fruit notes slide to the burnt side, like port reduction beginning to scorch in the pan, there are some nice concentrated dried fruit notes and a heavy nuttiness that continues to the end. No undue bitterness.', ': A few drops of water might coax out a little more caramel and nut meats, but doesn’t appreciably improve the experience. I’d skip it.', ': If this was once Auchentoshan, then the sherry monster murdered it and stuffed it in a closet. While ']"
45,Baker’s Bourbon (7 year) ,"[': Pine sap, fresh corn, with a vinegar edge to the nose tickle. Somewhat austere bourbon notes – mild notes of brown sugar, oak, and vanilla in balance, but without the big, round fullness of Booker’s. Deeper in the glass, the vinegar notes turn to a pleasant tart cherry. Not a particularly sweet bourbon.', ': Thin bodied, with a rehash of the tart cherry notes and distinct barrel tannins up front. Little tongue burn (surprisingly for 107 proof), and again the wood wins out over the sweetness. Not overly wooded, just not very sweet. Some slightly bitter vegetal notes appear toward the end, like the herbal component of bitters or aperitif liqueur.', ': Medium-long. A malty sweetness creeps out of the wood, at last, along with blanched almonds, light brown sugar, and more tart cherries. The overall impression is dry, but the finish is pleasantly, mildly, sweet.', ': A few drops of water makes the whiskey slightly sweeter on the tongue – like a simple syrup. It also seems to tie the bourbon together and makes for a more integrated whole, with less austerity. A few drops of water is a good idea with this one.', ': This is a bit of an oddball. One expects from bourbon a big, sweet ball of corn syrup, alcohol, and oak. Here the sweetness is merely background, letting nuances (including bitter and tannic ones) from the wood and, perhaps, the rye component play out. It does not show any of the objectionable “paint thinner” notes of white-label Jim Beam, nor is it excessively bitter or hot on the tongue. One thing going for it is that this “non-sweet” style of bourbon lets a lot of nuance through that is usually covered up by the onrush of sugary flavors. This could be described as a bourbon for people who don’t like sweets. In fact, if you’ve sworn off bourbon because it’s “too sweet” – this is probably worth a shot. For everyone else who likes their bourbons big, bold, and treacly… try before buying.']"
46,Balcones Texas Pot Still Bourbon ,"[': Shy. Whoever thought anything from Texas would be ‘shy’? ', ': Thin body. Robust tongue burn (more than expected for 46% ABV). Dusty cocoa. Oak, but without too much bitterness. Chocolate malt and stout beer.', ': Medium-long. Lots of tannin from the oak – mouth-drying and almost minty. Cocoa nibs, continuing the chocolate from the aroma through to the finish. Fades slowly but without adding anything.', ': More than a few drops of water increase the fruit notes (slightly) on the aroma, tame the burn (slightly) on the palate, and add some mint (slightly) on the finish. I (slightly) recommend water.', ': In contrast to ']"
47,Balcones Texas Rye (100 Proof) ,"[': Funky. Herbal. Chocolatey. There is a lot going on in here. I smell bruised bananas, dark roast coffee, funk that I haven’t smelled since ', ': Thin body. That dense, snappy chocolate and roasted coffee-bean note hits first, before a brief but intense tongue burn. Then, the coffee is tempered with a little cream and caramel, hazelnut, and banana cream pie. That all sounds really sweet but the whole effect is fairly dry.', ': Long. Those chocolate notes continue, inescapably dark and not-quite bitter. The finish doesn’t so much evolve as linger, filling the corners of my mouth with cocoa powder and black coffee for longer than I expect from a rye. An experience.', ': Several drops of water add a black pepper note to the aroma (although it could have been there all along, there’s such complexity here), and sweetens the palate. I suggest trying both without and then with a little water.', ': Wow. This is why I love (some) craft whiskies. This is so far off the map that comparing it to any old off-the-shelf rye is an exercise in futility. In other words, don’t think of this as a Rye Whiskey, think of it as belonging to its own category, with the only closest relatives being ']"
48,Ballantine’s 17 Year ,"[': Honey and honeysuckle. The honey here is refined, not raw or honeycomb-like. Very floral. Vanilla. Faint hint of woodsmoke. Sweet apple cider. Buttercream frosting. Reminds me a lot of ', ': Vanilla bean up front. Milky texture – not quite creamy. Elegant malt, with pure cereal flavors. Becomes tangy near the end – lemon custard.', ': More honey on the finish. A touch of wood. No bitterness to speak of. Medium-long. Echoes of honey and buttercream frosting.', ': Water releases a puff of cinnamon, a whiff of licorice, and something herbal that might be peat. It doesn’t hurt the body too much but it roughens up the finish, making the dram taste younger than it is. Skip the water here.', ': What’s most impressive here is the concentration of sweet desserty flavors without even a touch of bitterness on the finish. I guess that’s what you’re paying for. I could have used a little more nuttiness somewhere to round out the flavors. There is nothing here to indicate the presence of “low brow” grain whisky. After 17 years, it has definitely smoothed out. It adds the body and likely some of the cereal flavors, although the lack of full creaminess in the body texture makes me wonder if the grain whisky percentage in the blend is low. The overall impression is light and sweet, without any eclectic or surprising flavors to distract the palate. Surely, it’s very very good whisky… but I wouldn’t call it exciting.']"
49,Bank Note Blended Scotch ,"[': Peach (indicating mild sherry), some brash young grain. Somewhat lemony, but otherwise standard cereal notes. Light and inoffensive.', ': Mid-creamy body. Nougat. Lemon gummy candies. Cocoa nibs. Very mild tongue burn.', ': On the short side. Caramel and freshly-baked bread. The lemon notes turn a little bitter – like lemon pith.', ': Reveals some vanilla in the nose, thins the body, and washes out some of the more interesting flavors. Perhaps more citrus on the finish, but I wouldn’t bother.', ': It’s certainly not bad. Compared to every other $20/liter blended scotch, it stands far above the competition. It lacks a substantial aroma, but presents a pleasantly sweet array of notes on the tongue, and does not reveal any of the off-flavors I usually get with young grain. The finish is, like the nose, unremarkable. I would still prefer ']"
50,Bank Note Peated Reserve Blended Scotch ,"[': Clear but slightly antiseptic peat. Lemon Pledge, marshmallow, banana. One-dimensional.', ': Thin body. Mild tongue burn that resolves into muddy, marshy peat (I’m trying hard not to call it “swamp gas”. Oops, I guess I just did), engine oil, ', ': Medium-long. That engine oil / degreaser note persists on the finish, along with black walnut oil and scorched sugar. Unpleasant.', ': Why bother? Fine, ok. Several drops of water increase the smoky notes without making them more palatable. Smog. Now it smells like smog. The palate might be a little sweeter – brown sugar – but the finish is unchanged.', ': Ugh. No. I do not like this. Don’t buy it.']"
51,Barrell Cask Strength Bourbon (Batch 017) ,"[': Shy at first, with only a vague kiwi note and some far-away caramel. Now, a hint of roasting coffee beans and another rest… warm cherry pie, corn-heavy sweetness, and dense fudgy caramel. After even longer in the glass, there is a lovely cotton candy note accompanied by pistachio fudge. What a journey.', ': Hot! Hot hot hot. After a brief delay the tongue burn lights the tongue on fire. A few eye-watering moments later I can taste cherry pie (again), butterscotch, dense oak, and ahh who am I kidding all my taste buds are dead.', ': Long. A little dry, suddenly, with a lot of astringent oak, mouth-drying tannins, some mild charcoal, and a touch of maple sugar. Lingers, but doesn’t evolve.', ': Several drops of water adds a nice vegetal note (agave syrup) and causes a brief burst of floral notes. The palate burn is definitely tempered, but there is still a lot of tongue-numbing fire. The water adds a bit of sweetness and fruit on the finish. This certainly benefits from the addition of water, but give it a good nosing first.', ': Ok let’s get this out of the way: This bourbon is “craft” (or at least, hand-selected and blended), it’s cask-strength, and it’s in excess of 10 years of age, all of which explain its price-point. It is, however, not worth $90. If it were $50, I’d be singing its praises. If it were $70 I’d be conservatively talking about how rare 10 year-old cask strength bourbon is these days. At $90, I’m saying you can drink cheaper bourbon and be just as happy. It’s fine, I guess, with a number of delectable notes that are offset by heavy alcohol burn and periods of weird shyness.']"
52,Basil Hayden’s Bourbon ,"[': Lemon/lime soda syrup, maraschino cherry (the bright red kind), and fruit-punch bubblegum. The aroma is VERY similar to ', ': Thin body. No tongue burn to speak of. “Smooth”, I suppose, but mostly this is due to lack of flavor rather than lack of harshness. A reprise of the imitation fruit flavors from the aroma, but muddled and somewhat more chemical.', ': Short. The impression is of the exhaust that might issue from a chemical factory that manufactures imitation fruit flavor additives. A little tarry, and very slightly bitter. Vaguely unpleasant.', ': Why you would add water to a watery 40% ABV bourbon aside, the addition of a few drops yields a little dried coconut on the aroma, and a little extra vanilla sweetness on the palate. Take or leave water with this one.', ': I suppose you could say this is easy to drink, but then the same could be said of tutti-frutti vodka mixed down to wine-cooler strength with soda water. Basil Hayden’s is suspiciously similar to ']"
53,Belle Meade Straight Bourbon ,"[': Oak-heavy, with strong astringent woody notes, cherry juice, cherry cough syrup, cloves, and dark brown sugar. As the drink rests in the glass, that brown sugar aroma intensifies, and it picks up additional rye spice notes, like mace and cacao.', ': A little dry up front, with a thin body. A strong tongue burn interrupts tasting, but resumes with a nice array of hard candies, cinnamon red-hots, corn syrup, molasses, and almond extract (marzipan).', ': A nice balance between dry and sweet, and not bitter. Fades with cherry, blanched almonds, and a bunch of baking spices, including cinnamon.', ': A few drops of water makes the aroma a lot sweeter – including vanilla frosting and sweet cream. The palate is largely the same, as is the finish. Water is welcome, but not needed.', ': A very nice but very middle-of-the-road bourbon. It’s a little pricey for the category at $35, though, where you can find gems like ']"
54,BenRiach Heart of Speyside ,"[': Light, lemony, sweet. Shortbread cookies. Fresh hay, vanilla cream, banana cream pie. A bit thin or airy… could definitely use a higher bottling proof. A rest in the glass reveals some florals, especially rosewater.', ': Thin, watery body. Mild tongue burn. Various bakery goods (sugar cookies), slightly bitter barrel char, and walnuts. The longer it’s on the tongue, the more the bitter outweighs the sweet.', ': On the short side. The same notes from the palate persist. Slightly bitter. Fades without evolving.', ': As if this needs watering down. What? Fine. A few scant drops of water add a little vanilla frosting to the aroma and the palate. As expected, it does little for the experience. Still, if you’re not enjoying your glass try adding a little water.', ': Why anyone bottles any single malts at 40% ABV anymore is beyond me. This would probably be a rich, inviting example of classic Speyside single malt at 46% ABV, but instead it’s thin and watery. The thinness allows bitter elements to show through instead of being the foil to sweetness that they are in more robust malts. In essence, by taking out the things that make a single malt expensive (time in oak and high proof), they’ve taken out the things necessary to make this a good whisky. It’s not bad, certainly, but it’s not exciting.']"
55,Benromach (10 year) ,"[': Nice round grain-forward aroma. Vanilla, lemon, grains of paradise, and faint caramelized sugars. Lightly earthy (mushrooms) and only slightly grassy (or perhaps mossy). A rest in the glass brings the elements together into a more rounded whole.', ': Slightly creamy body. Malty, with standard ex-bourbon notes (vanilla, caramel), plus a tinge of anise, lemon peel and light peat. Where’s the sherry?', ': Medium-long. Warming, with mouth-drying tannis, but not bitter. More earthy “slightly peated” notes, but fades with brown sugar.', ': A few drops of water brings out vanilla frosting in the aroma, along with slight nuttiness and perhaps raisin. Added peat on the finish. Water is definitely of benefit with this dram.', ': Nice! Simple, but full-flavored. Peat is subtle, but in nice balance. (Note that a previous tasting of earlier batches showed elements of young “new make” on the nose. These are absent with the recent batch that I sampled.) Still, this does not rise significantly above your “standard” ex-bourbon single malt, especially as I could not detect any sherry notes at all. The fact that as much as 20% of the vatting comes from first-fill sherry and that the whole was finished in oloroso sherry completely escapes me in the glass. At $45, this is a reasonable choice for a rotating daily dram. I probably wouldn’t pay much more than that.']"
56,Benromach (15 year) ,"[': Deep sherry. Butterscotch, fig, and strawberry jam. Complex, and a bit funky.', ': A bit hot. Oaky and buttery, with resinous dried fruit. There’s a lot of depth to explore here, and I wasn’t able do it justice with a single pour.', ': Medium-long. Tannic and a bit nutty, with fading slight bitterness. Surprisingly dry and timid, considering the depth on the palate.', ': A few drops of water highlight brighter fruit notes on the nose, and add peanut butter to the palate. The water also balances out the sherry and the tannic notes better.', ': Well, the balance that I like to see in a sherried malt is not really there. We have some funky, resinous sherry notes, but no fruit-forward “bomb”. The jam notes are muddy, like red wine dregs, which pulls the whole experience off-center. I would enjoy this if it were budget-priced (like ']"
57,Benromach Imperial Proof (10 year) ,"[': Very hot (of course). Orange peel, and hard candies. And fire.', ': Redolent of orange peel and orange candies, although it’s hard to taste through all that fire. Reminds me of a mix of cask-strength ', ': Long and drying. More of the same candied orange.', ': A generous splash of water helps bring out toffee flavors on the nose, and makes the palate sparkly with bright fruit, and a bit of earthy peat. I highly recommend braving the full strength for a sip or two, and then retreating to the water.', ': A bright, fierce whisky. Great both with or without water, but at full proof it’s a tongue-blinding ']"
58,Benromach Organic ,"[': Nutty, but similar to the ', ': Light, almost watery body. Slightly tart (lemon/lime).', ': Medium-short. Bubblegum! Somewhat floral. Rosewater?', ': A dash of water brings out an unfortunate “white dog” vegetal/grassy note on the aroma. After a rest in the glass, this transforms into ripe banana on both the nose and palate.', ': Interesting, containing oaky flavors but without heaviness or bitter tannins. Nice nuttiness, but the reaction to water betrays its youth. That grassiness reminds me of previous batches of Benromach 10 year, which I did not detect in my review of a recent batch. I’d go out on a limb and say that Benromach needs to reach an approximate age of 10+ years to taste properly mature. I would not spend $15 more to get a younger, less-tasty version of the 10-year, even if it is organic. Note that I ', ' be willing to pay that premium for an organic release with a 10 year-old age statement, if it was at least as good as the standard one.']"
59,Benromach Peat Smoke ,"[': Woodsmoke (smoldering campfire), vanilla, and light oak. Somewhat anemic, and very dry.', ': Black pepper and a lot more smoldering campfire.', ': A fading, slightly bitter, reprise of the vanilla-and-smoke motif.', ': A few drops of water add some floral notes – like white tea – which are quickly voided by the smokiness.', ': Not a fan. As with ']"
60,Bernheim Original (7 year) Small Batch Wheat Whiskey ,"[': A piercing mix of sour cherry, fragrant blooming fruit trees, and orange peel. Under that, a layer of toasted almonds and a heavy wheaty graininess like cake dough (or poundcake). There is a tinge of acetone, but it is thoroughly overpowered by the robust fruit and grain aromas.', ': Thick body, with more cherry (syrup) and orange (bitters). There is an unctuous honey-like sweetness, somewhere in between processed honey and molasses. Brown sugar and smoky charred oak round out the flavor.', ': Medium-long. Sweet and nutty, fading slowly with candied nuts and then fresh walnuts. A hint of bitterness, but not too much.', ': A few drops of water reveal an interesting licorice note, as well as the usual buttercream/vanilla aromas. No change in taste or finish. Water optional, especially at the very-drinkable 45% ABV bottling strength.', ': A tasty whiskey, with a lot of the sweetness and oak flavors one would expect from a 7 year-old spirit in new oak casks. There’s a nice balance of tart fruit, florals, and heavier sugary notes, and it’s neither cloying nor does it ever taste fake, like a lot of “corn syrup” bourbons. I can also say from experience that it makes a very refined cocktail. It is lighter in character than most bourbons.']"
61,Big Peat ,"[': Initial aroma is puzzling. Dry white wine, blanco tequila, and a distinct lack of peat. A rest in the glass opens up a little peat in the form of classic ocean-influenced brine and distant campfire smoke. Emphasis on “little”.', ': Slightly syrupy body. The peat is more evident here, with a lot of earthy/fungal peat and a touch of smolder. Dry, with only a hint of bland simple-syrup for sweetness.', ': Medium-long. A swath of menthol and a hint of orange peel. The same peat notes from the palate continue here, but fade without change. A ghost of cherry or tart plum concludes the finish.', ': A few drops of water make the aroma more piercing, and the peat more smoke-forward. The palate, now thinner, is only slightly sweeter (vanilla fudge). On the whole, the experience is better. Like 10% better. Go for the water. ', ': I have tried Big Peat several times in the past, but this is my first formal review. I have thought before – and continue to think today – that this bottle is misnamed. Nothing about this – let alone the peat – is big. 46% ABV is a nice choice, but hardly “big” in the context of available peat monsters. All of the flavors are reticent and nothing stands out. It’s certainly less brash and more drinkable than some ', ' hobby of whisky tasting, I’d say good on you for knowing what you like! That’s way more important than agreeing with some noob on the Internet. This bottle is just not for me.']"
62,Black Bottle Blended Scotch ,"[': Tarry, earthy overtones, with a smoky barbeque sauce-like sweetness. Oh God, now I can’t smell anything but barbeque sauce! The alcohol tickle is piquant – despite the baseline 40% ABV, this crawls right up your nose. Undercurrents of chewing tobacco and mulching leaves.', ': Nice creamy mouthfeel. Green and vegetal up front, then some salted caramels and finally a burst of woodsmoke. Very tame on the tongue. Really, it’s very orderly for something that’s all Islay.', ': Only of medium length, despite all the peat. Sweet, burnt sugar, freshly-dug earth. Very mild bitterness in the back on the tongue. Remains sweet and smoky through the fade-out. Pleasant.', ': Several drops of water yield processed white sugar in the nose, but kill the smoke. Mouthfeel is not compromised, but the finish is more grassy and bitter. This doesn’t need water – I wouldn’t bother.', ': I can see why this has a following. It’s peaty in all the right ways, has the thick, viscous mouthfeel that only a blend with good grain whisky has, and is the right price. At $20, this blows ']"
63,Black Maple Hill Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': Perfectly round – practically spherical. All the characters are here: piquant cinnamon, sticky toffee, pine sap and freshly-hewn oak. The bold 95 proof crawls up your nose, but it carries aroma with it. Deep under all the cooked sugar flavors (caramel, toffee, the gooey stuff in pecan pie) there is a narrow band of cherry fruit and coconut. Despite the name, I don’t get any maple syrup!', ': Medium bodied. Soft on the palate initially, but then it burns with the full strength of 95 proof. Distinctly sweet, with prominent cherry notes, mild spices, and a deep resounding woodiness.', ': Pretty long. Coconut sets in at first, evolving into vanilla bean, espresso, and sour cherry lozenge with an entire lack of bitterness! Trails off with some slight hazelnut.', ': Water brings out some interesting vegetal notes – green banana leaves, lime peel, raw sugar cane. However, it thins the body and disarms the potency of the alcohol, and the flavors with it. Toss a few drops in your last sip, but don’t water the whole glass.', ': No low points, although it verges on woody in places. Round and bold in the nose, soft and sweet on the tongue, and lingering on the finish. This stuff is hard to find, and very much delivers. To my bourbon-novice palate, it’s dang good for under $40.

65,Bomberger’s Declaration Bourbon ,"[': Sweet and oily, with heavy oak presence verging on smoky (like fruitwood smoke), but not actually… you know… smoky. A dash of fruit – mostly cherry and orange peel – adds range. A very full, robust aroma.', ': Medium bodied. Hot. Oaky tannins immediately coat the mouth, creating a sense of astringency. This is balanced as the wood sugars arrive, punctuated by hints of cherry and orange peel (again), although the overall flavor is not as sweet as was promised by the nose. ', ': Medium-long. Some charcoal, and more astringent woodiness. Here there is a suggestion of mint and over-brewed tea. Fades with drying, mouth-puckering tannins and the last of the fruit, now dried and dusty.', ': A few drops of water add a vanilla buttercream note to the aroma, and tames the palate burn slightly. No huge surprises, but a little water isn’t a bad idea here.', ': Despite the astringent notes (which I generally don’t like), I was impressed by the versatility and range of this whiskey. Deep oaky notes are balanced nicely against a mid-level sweetness and high notes of fresh fruit. Not too sweet, not too oaky, and not (quite) too hot. The aroma, however, is the best part and the rest of the experience pales somewhat in comparison.']"
66,Booker’s Bourbon (Batch C07-B-7) ,"[': Chocolate-covered caramels. Root beer floats with vanilla ice cream. The aromas are aggressive at 65.4%, but subtleties and complexities lie hidden beneath that blanket of alcohol vapor. Something vegetal and rooty, like sassafras or ', ': It burns like fire! After much eye-watering and stamping of feet, I’m finally able to taste cinnamon red-hots, tannin-y charred oak (slightly bitter), and caramel hot cocoa. This is simply too strong to taste much at full proof.', ': Long and warming. The sweet candy notes return on the finish, along with Christmas mulling spices and and an overall feeling of well-being for having surmounted the obstacle… not unlike the feeling which must follow walking across hot coals. It fades elegantly, with a touch more of cinnamon and oak, but without the bitterness perceived on the tongue.', ': It should go without saying that this whiskey demands some water. A few drops fail to tame the nose tickle, (while bringing out some weird veggie notes like celery salt), nor the tongue burn. A much more aggressive watering (probably down to around 50%) yields a sour note – like apple cider vinegar – and reduces the nose tickle to a manageable level. The palate, much muted, reveals more cake-y notes with vanilla and buttercream. There’s still a great deal of oak.', ': A beast of a whiskey. Booker’s shows its best flavors and aromas while undiluted (except on the palate, where you can only taste fire), and provides a sense of accomplishment that few whiskies can offer when conquered neat. That said, one will be much more comfortable with a glass of Booker’s if a generous splash of water (or two) is used to tame it. Booker’s also shows off its strength (literally) in cocktails, where the extra concentration stands up to bitters, vermouth, sugar, and anything else you can throw at it.']"
67,Booker’s Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': Spicy rye and cinnamon accost the nose, like red hot pokers of nutmeg and chai directly to my sinuses. You’ll want to approach this one carefully. Under the spice is a deep sea of woody caramel, and fruit verging on red plum and cinnamon applesauce. Every note is big and bold, and accompanied by a fiery nose burn that is more pummel than tickle.', ': Expected torrents of fire course across the tongue. When the burn (and the tears) subside, one is left with a roiling sea of dark chocolate, cedar chips, applewood smoke, burned simple syrup, charcoal, and unfathomable depths of woody corn sweetness and caramelized sugars.', ': Long, and very astringent (drying). Cinnamon dominates, oak tannin, walnut skins, and on the tail end, marshmallow cream. Cries out for water.', ': After a liberal (and, I have to admit, somewhat vindictive) dilution with water, I now get a bright piercing peach note on the nose, clove, maple sugar candies, and I can actually get my nose in the glass. The palate, though still fiery, shows a neater, more orderly array of bakery sweets, nuts, cereal sugars, and wood sap. The finish might be somewhat more bitter and herbal, with notes like rosemary and raw ginger coming to mind.', ': With or without water, this is a big drink. While I’m relatively comfortable with the sipping of cask-strength whiskies neat, something about the craggy mountain of flavor that is Booker’s was a big challenge for my nose and palate. The alcohol, although mature, is aggressive and untamed from the assault on my nose, through the river of fire on my tongue, until the tail end of the desiccating dryness of the finish. The usual characters are here in abundance: cinnamon and nutmeg, implied fruitiness (although not a clear cherry note like I find in other bourbons), charcoal, heavy oak, and sticky-sweet caramelized corn syrup. Do yourself a favor, though, and dilute this one heavily with water. Put some hair on your chest with a first sip neat, if you must, but you’ll likely burn out your palate if you drink an entire dram as-is. Also, water seems to both tame and educate this beast, revealing new notes and cleaning up the sloppy wildness of the original ones.']"
68,Boutique-y Whisky: Benrinnes (17 year) Batch 5 ,"[': Almost phenolic – a ghost of peat that isn’t there. Fresh laundry. Lavender flowers. Dry white wine.

It doesn’t stay sweet for long: definitely a hint of peat. Earthy but not quite fungal. Very low tongue burn considering the ABV. Rosewater, white peppercorn.', ': Medium length. Slightly bitter, with bitter aromatics like gentian (think cocktail bitters) and some charcoal. Not many of the aroma or palate notes make it through. Fades slowly, but doesn’t evolve.', ': A few drops of water open up some citrus aromas – orange peel chiefly – and they make the palate softer and silkier in texture. There may be some new fruit notes – dried pear? But they are muddy and hard to decipher. Water optional.', ': This one is kind of all over the place. The peat notes are unexpected, and they actually provide a nice earthy contrast to the typical light-and-airy Benrinnes style. Benrinnes does not use peated malt, so I’m guessing that the process water must pick some up along the way. Unfortunately, the aroma is the best part of this whisky – I wish those aromatics carried forward through the finish. I feel that the price is too high, so I would be much happier to buy this in a 375ml format, but not for any more than the UK-equivalent price of $65. Still, 17 year-old single malt is not readily available in today’s market for less than $150, so I probably shouldn’t complain.']"
69,"Boutique-y Whisky: Irish Single Malt #1, Batch 4 ","[': Piercingly tart, with a distinct pine sap note. Lemon peel, juniper, fresh berries, pineapple, granny smith apples, and more that I just can’t pick up. It’s just… it’s a lot.', ': Thin body. Malt sweetness up front, which is ambushed by a tart kiwi or maybe ', ': Medium-short. Oh man, that kiwi note is back, and it’s delicious. It fades quickly, replaced by (sorry) spent bubblegum, and apple cider. This is soon replaced by a ghost of menthol.', ': A few drops of water amp up the kiwi note – YES! – and add a layer of sweet vanilla. The palate has a silkier texture, and seems a bit more coherent. Finish unchanged. Definitely give it a go without water and then see how it changes when you add just a little.', ': Eclectic doesn’t begin to describe it. A fascinating (and lovely) aroma that spans pine sap to fresh berries is followed by an equally high-contrast set of flavors including that elusive and delectable kiwi notes that I’ve found in ']"
70,Boutique-y Whisky: Speyside #3 (8 year) Batch 1 ,"[': Aroma is spicy! Star anise, cardamom, and a touch of spiced apple cider. A rest in the glass adds a layer of gooey caramel, ginger tea, and a touch of light brown sugar… reminds me of ‘blondie’ brownies.', ': Thin body, with a robust tongue burn. Ouchies. 50% ABV is well represented. Already some mouth-drying tannins, dark cocoa, coffee grounds, burnt caramel syrup, and a dose of dry oak.', ': On the long side. Still spicy. Café latte, scalded milk, nutty in a slightly bitter way – bitter almonds. Pretty long and lingering.', ': This dram seems like it can handle some water. Aroma has fewer spices, more nuts. Palate is much softer even with just a few drops. Chewy toffee. Otherwise the same.', ': Intriguing – it tastes like a candied café latte, and the bitterness seems to come from that almost-burnt caramel rather than from oak. The bitterness is well-distributed and well-balanced so it doesn’t distract, although I found the whole experience is a little too dry. Still, it’s shockingly good at 8 years of age.']"
71,Boutique-y Whisky: Teaninich (11 year) Batch 2 ,"[': Awesome green pear, assorted florals, honeysuckle etc. Someone in the Twitter tasting said lemonade. Yup. Candied pear drops.', ': A little banana up front, with a nice even tongue burn, not too hot at all. Just lets you know it’s there. Thin body, but the flavor turns syrup-like quickly. Sweet and light, fruit-forward but with a background of clean cereal grains. Pleasant. A rest in the glass adds more banana (banana cream pie?), and the body actually firms up, becoming silky.', ': Creamy, with vanilla and fresh dairy cream notes. A little kiwi maybe? Exits quickly but with no off-flavors and with minimal bitterness.', ': A few drops bring out a lot more cereal grains but they’re a little musty, like wet hay. The water kills some of the fruit and thins the palate, too. It does add a lot of sweetness – sugar cubes! – to the finish, which is fun. Water optional.', ': Fresh and crisp. This would be forgettable at 40% ABV, but here it’s nicely present and active. By color and flavor it’s clear this is from ex-bourbon, likely a refill cask. It shows the raw expression of Teaninich, which is cereal-driven but adorned with plenty of fresh vibrant green fruit. A fun dram, and a great way to experience Teaninich if you haven’t before.']"
72,Boutique-y Whisky: Three Ships (6 year) Batch 1 ,"[': Cured leather, dark roast coffee beans, dark cocoa nibs. Balsamic vinegar that’s so old the fruit has left the building and it has to be scraped out with a putty knife. A rest in the glass turns those cocoa nibs into honest-to-God dark chocolate. Dry, but deep.', ': Thick, syrupy body. The same notes from the aroma, but OH MY GOD MY TONGUE IS ON FIRE. OK… Ok, I’m Ok. I can’t taste anything, but I’m Ok. Did I say the whisky is a little hot? More balsamico, more chocolate. Maybe it’s the pain-induced delirium, but this tastes just like Aztec hot chocolate with chili in it.', ': Long. Dusty cocoa continues through the finish. This stuff is the film noir version of single malt. Fades ultra-slowly, with the chocolate notes slowly being replaced by mint. No bitterness.', ': More than a few drops of water somehow make the aroma drier. Dusty cocoa nibs, Egyptian mummies, etc. The palate is mercifully easier to handle (could be the water, could be my dead taste buds from earlier). I highly recommend the water, not because it adds any flavors (it doesn’t) but because it tames the tongue burn, just a little.', ': Wowza. So, Ok, here you’re paying top dollar for something you just can’t get anywhere else. South African whisky that isn’t available in the US, with a PX sherry finish, at cask strength. That’s worth whatever the exchange rate currently sets it at. The chocolate notes are unreal, and they are perfectly – I mean PERFECTLY – balanced with the remnants of super-old PX sherry left in this cask. The 53.7% ABV is serious business, and is so concentrated I feel like I should be drinking it from an eyedropper instead of a Glencairn. I’m going to call this “Must Try”, which is ridiculous, because good freaking luck, but it really is an experience if you see the opportunity.']"
73,Boutique-y Whisky: Tomatin (11 year) Batch 4 ,"[': Huh. Interesting. Green banana, odd florals (hops?), coconut water, green tomatoes (damnit, TBWC label!), and a dusting of sulfur that does not quite rise to the level of “rotten eggs”. An oddball, and complex.', ': Medium bodied. Ample tongue burn, as expected, which resolves into raw cane sugar, pineapple, coconut, and… I have no idea. Beeswax? No…Tomato compote? No… Sourdough? Maybe.', ': Medium-short. Now there’s a sulfury note that is almost meaty like turkey jerky, which has replaced all of the tropical fruit notes and grassiness. Fades quickly, alas. So damn weird.', ': Several drops of water add sweetness in the form of brown sugar and vanilla. Maybe milk chocolate too? Cocoa nibs at least. Water is interesting here. Try it first neat, and then add a little water to see how it changes.', ': Whaaa… this was one of the hardest tastings notes to write in recent memory. The flavors and aromas are all over the place, and don’t seem to fit neatly into existing scotch categories. It sounds like it should taste tropical or rummy from my choice of fruit descriptors, but that’s totally not the overall impression. It’s as if someone took the makings for a frozen daiquiri and piled up all of the stem and skin and pith trimmings instead and let them ferment.']"
74,Bowmore 10 “Devil’s Cask” ,"[': A dense, regal marriage of dark, reduced sherry, sweet red fruits, and sedate, oily peat.', ': Thin bodied. Drying, and intense as befits nearly 114 proof whisky. The flavor is slightly closed off, but hides a bounty of dried dark berries, balsamic, and peat that tastes more like coal and liquid smoke than actual smoke.', ': Long, lingering and subtle. Leather, resin, and furniture polish. The reduced dregs of a glass of old sherry. The smouldering embers of a fruitwood fire. On the tail end, dark chocolate-covered dried berries.', ': Several drops of water really wake up the alcohol in the nose, revealing more of that oily peat. They also serve to open up the palate, letting out some sticky caramel and bold red wine.', ': This is totally unlike the ‘Darkest’ 15-year, and in fact tastes much older and more concentrated. Instead of the wild, fungal brashness of Darkest, the flavors here are muted but sinewy, slow-moving but powerful. The Devil’s Cask drinks like a much older sherry-monster that has given so much up to the angel’s share that it bottles out at a low cask-strength. That’s amazing considering both its youth, and its high ABV. That justifies the price – if I tasted it blind, I would swear up and down that this was 30 years old and 46% ABV. I could wish that the palate wasn’t so closed off – its one weakness.']"
75,Bowmore 12 ,[]
76,Bowmore 15 “Darkest” ,"[': Wow. Plum sauce, prune juice, and resin. A thick fog of funky, swampy peat, and layers upon layers of fossilized aroma, starting with the tar pits. The fruit is full-bodied but oxidized and, with the peat, comes across as a bubbling ferment of wild, yeasty, compost-y complexity. The aroma is varied and – while not quite muddy – is definitely confused. An intriguing experience. Note that a lengthy rest in the glass – more than 15 minutes – reveals a very intense, meaty caramel note that is worth waiting for.', ': On the thin side. Lots of red-wine tannins, and the initial flavors are of red grape skins, and balsamic. Then, the peat takes over and asserts itself over the sherry with flavor of seaweed, mushroom, and soil. Somewhat two-faced, rather than an integrated whole.', ': Long. The fruit flavors freshen somewhat, becoming very cranberry-like, while the peat remains boggy and earthy. At no point does this make me think of ‘smoke’, although the unfortunate association (totally in my own head, I assure you) of composting (rotting) fruit keeps occurring to me.', ': A few drops of water wake up a little fresh, tart fruit. Cranberries, again. The palate, also, is a little tart-er. The finish is more fully peated, and the peat has more of a vegetal quality. A few drops (only!) aren’t a bad idea.', ': When you think about sherry and peat, you generally think about Highland Park, with its light tickle of citrusy Orkney peat and gently sweet, fruity sherry. This is the opposite of both of those aspects. The sherry is resinous and funky, the peat muddy and vegetative. The combination is alchemical, though, with an otherworldly fungalness… fungitude… fungality… funkiness that brings together the most edgy, concentrated, and ']"
77,Bowmore Legend ,"[': Well-balanced maritime smoke. Slightly citrusy (lemon), with a caramel malt core, and medium levels of peat.', ': Soft, mildly sweet malt. Mineral-flecked seawater, and woodfire smoke.', ': Medium-long. Some charcoal, and quickly-fading peat.', ': A few drops of water increase the apparent peat level, and also bring more lemon oil and something floral – like lavender. The lemon repeats on the palate. Try a few drops of water, but don’t dilute it too much.', ': This is not a malt for peat-freaks. This is a very well-balanced, mildly peated dram for a very respectable price. Often younger, cheaper Islay malts come across as brash, acrid, and bitter. Legend is the opposite of all of these: gentle, sweet, and mildly smoky. It won’t win any awards for potency or complexity, but it scratches the peat itch for under $30 a bottle, and can also serve as a gentle introduction for peat newbies.']"
78,Bowmore Small Batch ,"[': Gentle peat, flecked with refined honey and sweet cream. Banana cream pie, toasted coconut, and vanilla salt-water taffy. Light, sweet, but artfully presented and without any rough edges.', ': More of the same. Vanishing tongue burn, followed by more coconut, vanilla, and lightly salty peat in turns. Elegant, but light.', ': Of medium length, with a bit more toasty oak, roasted nuts, and soft peat smoke. Ends with a touch of malt syrup.', ': A few drops of water seem to only add a caustic edge to the nose tickle and introduce a hint of wet hay. Unnecessary, especially at 40% ABV.', ': While I could have done with a bit more robustness at 46% or so, I applaud both the craftsmanship of this whisky, and its sane price point. Clearly more well-rounded and well-integrated than the cheaper ']"
79,Breaker Bourbon ,"[': Piney, like young rye. Basic corn-forward spirit – not too youthful – with a very mild but also pleasant pineapple note. Shy, and a rest in the glass does not reveal additional aromas.', ': Syrupy/silky body with a moderate tongue burn. Quite sweet, with elements of caramel, nougat, marshmallow, and tropical fruit jam. Very nice, with no rough edges. The texture is unusual, and pleasant.', ': Of medium length. Mild tannins, with leftover tartness from the tropical fruits. Suddenly shy again, fades with only a hint of charcoal bitterness.', ': A few drops of water do the worst possible thing: they wash out what little aroma there was! The palate and finish seem unchanged, except for a slight bump in the already-sufficient level of sweetness. Avoid water with this one, and maybe only use it in cocktails where you want the whiskey to take a back seat.', ': This might be damning with faint praise, but the whisky has no off notes, and nothing objectionable in its makeup. The aroma has a nice (and rare) pineapple note, but is otherwise shy to the point of boredom. The palate is on the sweet side, but without any challenging aspects (charcoal, tannins, heavy wood, etc.) and aside from the typical tongue burn, is quite easy to drink, with a very nice silky (oh God, I’m going to say it… ']"
80,Breaking & Entering Bourbon ,[]
81,Broken Barrel Cask Strength Bourbon ,"[': Strong nose tickle. Piercing notes of spicy ground cinnamon, dried cherries, and butterscotch. Oaky, with resinous notes of aged lumber, sap, and varnish. Fairly dry on the nose – not much sweetness.', ': Silky body. Robust tongue burn which hits immediately. Spicy, with significant rye spice notes of clove, cinnamon, star anise, and maraschino cherry. The sweetness of the corn finally comes through, with a fudgy kind of caramel-and-marshmallow (', ': Medium-long and tannic. A reprise of the aroma notes – dry woods and spices. Evolves a bit of candy corn (honey / corn syrup) and dry cocoa powder before fading.', ': Several drops of water initially mute the aroma, necessitating a rest in the glass. The water adds a good amount of much-needed caramel sweetness and a delectable vanilla buttercream note. The palate burn is also reduced. I HIGHLY recommend adding water to this.', ': This is not a bad cask-strength bourbon. It’s a little on the dry side, but the sweetness does peek through in places where it’s needed for balance. I can’t detect anything specifically different as a result of the added staves, although there is a slight sandalwood-and-chocolate note that I associate with French oak. It is definitely heavily influenced by the rye, with spice-cabinet notes dominating.']"
82,Bruichladdich – The Classic Laddie ,"[': Lightly fruity, with orchard fruits (white peach, crisp plum, yellow apples), golden raisins, and raw honey. Assorted florals – honeysuckle and rose primarily – with an undercurrent of light, nutty, grain-forward malt. A tinge of youth brings both vibrancy and a swath of chemical aromas (not quite acetone). Nose tickle is mild despite the fairly high ABV, and there is a nice balance between sweetness and airiness. A rest in the glass reveals even more fruit.', ': Viscous but not quite syrupy body. A moderate tongue burn – consistent with 50% ABV – is followed by unctuous dripping honey, peach jelly, buttered scones, and more golden raisins. On subsequent tastes, the red wine elements are a little clearer – redder fruits and jammy port wine. Very tasty.', ': Medium long. Delicately sweet, with only a balancing spot of charcoal bitterness. Evolves through light fruits – dried – nondescript florals, and then fades with a note that I can only describe as peach gummy rings.', ': A few drops of water add a creamy marshmallow and vanilla note, which fade quickly after a rest in the glass. The water doesn’t seem to have much effect otherwise. Proofing it down a few more % releases a banana and kiwi note, but makes the palate bland. Water optional with this one.', ': I love the combination of peach, golden raisin, clear crisp malt, and honey. There’s exactly the right amount of sweetness, just enough bitterness to give it contrast, and a few lovely high notes stuck here and there, including that amazing peach gummy flavor. My only complaint is that the vibrancy of young malt is attended by that acetone/paint thinner note, although it’s only present on the aroma. A few of those ex-bourbon casks (likely the refill ones) in the vatting could really have used another couple of years of maturing to polish that off. I look forward to trying a different batch to see what changes.']"
83,Bruichladdich (10 year) – The Laddie Ten ,"[': Restrained peat – mossy and herbal. This is peat that ', ': Somewhat nutty. A little bit on the dry side. Unexpected amount of bitter barrel tannins up front, with a tinge of acrid smoke and wholly absent fruit.', ': Lightly smoky, but the bitter barrel influence continues. Charcoal, menthol, and honey. Fades with some herbal notes.', ': Several drops of water brings some florals to the nose – reminding me of peated Balvenie. The water doesn’t improve the rest of the experience for me, however.', ': The nose on this one is impressive, with very well-integrated fruits and middling amounts of elegant peat. However, this all falls apart on the palate for me, with disjointed notes of bitter wood and acrid smoke. The finish appears short, and while it delivers on the peat aftertaste, there is little else to recommend it. Some people are very into this release, but I have been wholly underwhelmed at both tastings. Ah well, perhaps my sensitivity to bitter tastes has doomed this release for me.']"
84,Bruichladdich Octomore 10 year (4th edition) ,"[': Um. Wow. Fragrant. A ton of lemon verbena, white tea, honeysuckle, and orange peel, plus a ghost of peat infusing all of it with smoke that reminds me more of Chinese tea-smoking than peat. The whole is also sweeter than 11.1, with a lot more brown sugar and a little oak resin. Lovely. This release is also more stable – it appears unchanged after a rest in the glass.', ': Medium bodied. A robust (but not blinding) tongue burn is followed by burnt salted caramel, mild earthy peat, and sweet malty barley with just enough wood to remind you that it’s been aged longer.', ': Long. The peat rolls in like a storm front. Dark, heavy woodsmoke-style peat, with a some of the dark chocolate notes from ', ': Several drops of water wake up an odd pomegranate note (like fresh grenadine), and also bring back some of the fleeting floral notes from the original pour. The palate is a little fruitier, as is the finish, and the licorice note arrives earlier. Definitely try this without water first, and then add a little after it starts to languish in the glass.', ': This is definitely my favorite of the three Octomores that I got to taste. That said, I did miss some of those youthful bright citrus notes that were prevalent in ']"
85,Bruichladdich Octomore 11.1 ,"[': A first whiff reveals cool, clean, citrus-flecked smoke. While the nose tickle is robust enough to keep my nose from going too deep in the glass, the aroma is clearly peated but in an understated, crisp, streamlined kind of way. There’s also sea breeze, lemon and lime zests, shortbread biscuits, and pale but fragrant malt. After a brief rest (and carefully venturing deeper into the glass), I find grapefruit, more lemon-lime soda, and subtle floral notes. The peat is present, but decidedly in the background. Definitely allow the glass to sit and develop, as it changes over time.', ': Lightly syrupy body. A blinding tongue burn, as expected, clears quickly to repeat a lot of the aroma notes, especially the lime and grapefuit. The peat is in the form of earthy campfire with crackling pine needles but, again, is in the background.', ': Very long. Now the peat takes over. Waves of mouth-drying earthy woodsmoke with vague bitter herbal notes – aloe? – continue through the finish, fading slowly along with a final flash of grapefuit.', ': The addition of quite a few drops of water instantly release a delicate rosewater note that was not there before, along with a suggestion of green banana. The palate is a little livelier, but no less powerful. It might also be slightly sweeter. I don’t notice any change on the finish. I highly recommend trying this without water first – brave it! – and then with water to see how it changes for you.', ': An experience. Octomore sears the mouth, but relents and delivers on that light floral fruity spirit that Bruichladdich is so proud of. The peat is heavy on the finish, but never overbearing – you feel like you get your money’s worth without being punched in the face with it. There’s peat, but there’s also room for delicate citrus and florals. Every true whisky lover should probably experience Octomore at least once in their lives, even if they don’t spring for a full bottle of it.']"
86,Bruichladdich Octomore 11.3 ,"[': Wow – so immediately different from ', ': Syrupy body. After a white-hot searing tongue burn, there is black pepper, pickled ginger, brown bread, and sweet barley.', ': Long. The peat now comes rolling in but still not as strong as expected. The peat is dark and earthy and not very smoky. The ginger and black pepper persist, and now there’s an aroma of rich dark earth and extra-dark chocolate. Not bitter. Note that on subsequent sips the peat seems to build up, and then starts to deliver the more classic Islay peat flavors you’d expect. On the tail end, a surprising note of roasted coffee bean.', ': Several drops of water seem to tease out a thread of lime zest that was missing, but otherwise don’t appear to have any effect on the aroma. The palate is a little crisper, with more evident (mostly citrus) fruit. The peat on the finish is also more evident, but it’s also more bitter. This dram seems to benefit from the addition of a little water.', ': In previous editions I preferred the x.3 for its vibrancy and clear conveyance of barley. This time, the grapefuit notes in the 11.1 won me over versus the somewhat muddled chocolate-and-earth notes in 11.3. The peat was also clearer, crisper, and better-integrated in 11.1. It’s good… really good… but if you’re only going to get one edition this year, get the ']"
87,Buffalo Trace Bourbon ,"[': Compared to some bourbons, the nose is wood-forward and tannic – almost vinegary – with sweet caramel notes in the background. Hazelnuts and almonds, turning to vanilla after a few moments of rest in the glass. Dusty spices, mild charcoal, dry cornmeal.', ': Slightly tart, soon turning malty with marshmallow and cocoa nibs. Not cloyingly sweet, but with a fine balance of wood, sugar, and tartness.', ': Warming and of medium length. A reprise of the aroma, predominantly nut skins and smoldering charcoal. Fading with vanilla bean and cinnamon.', ': A few drops of water awaken a familiar “candy corn” note that luckily isn’t too plastic/fake/corn syrupy. On the palate, it retains its flavor but pops a little more. I highly recommend a little water with this one, and you shouldn’t feel bad about dropping in an ice cube once in awhile, either.', ': I like a bourbon that doesn’t make your eyes water with sweetness, but also doesn’t go fully grassy (like ', ' bourbon over ice with bitters and sugar makes me feel like a Southern gentleman in a white suit, rocking away the afternoon on my front porch. Somehow I look like the KFC Colonel in this vignette… but you get the idea. Also, there’s nothing simpler than assembling an Old Fashioned when you can’t be bothered to break out the shaker or strainer.']"
88,Bulleit Bourbon ,[]
89,Bulleit Bourbon (10 year) ,"[': Soft, woody caramel, pine sap, furniture polish, and a hint of maple syrup. Quite dry… with a sawdust quality.', ': Not too hot on the entry. Thin-ish body. Piney, eucalyptus, charcoal, nut skins, root beer. Still dry, but with a better balance than the aroma.', ': Charcoal pervades, with the attendant bitter oaky tannins, but the balance is nice, and there’s just enough fading sweetness to keep it so.', ': A little water perks up the nose, adding rock candy and candied pecans, complete with cinnamon. On the palate, it’s a little more vibrant, and a bit of maraschino cherry has crept in around the edges. I highly recommend a bit of water.', ': Like its younger sibling, Bulleit tastes like its marketing materials describe it – a rough-and-ready frontier whisky. It doesn’t pander with sugary candy notes, but gives you the oak and the alcohol up front and doesn’t much waver from that formula. The extra age has not markedly sweetened, mellowed, or concentrated the bourbon… but has removed many of the ‘acetone’ notes and given it a little softness around the edges and a little better balance on the finish. This presents a conundrum. At $25, the NAS Bulleit is underaged and suitable only for cocktails. At $50, the Bulleit 10 is eminently drinkable neat and makes very nice cocktails, but you could get both of those qualities in something that’s ']"
90,Bulleit Rye ,"[': Pungent! Caraway seed, menthol, eucalyptus, cinnamon (stale), black pepper (fresh), and a hint of cherry.', ': Thin body. A little fiery, and rough around the edges in a “frontier” style. Cinnamon red-hots, pine sap, cinnamon toast (without the raisins). Somewhat dry (not particularly sweet). A little bit vegetal or grassy.', ': Medium-long. Some sweetness emerges in the form of cinnamon saltwater taffy. The pine/eucalyptus is muted now, and the finish is primarily oaky, with a slight bitterness. A ghost of apple skins completes the finish.', ': Several drops of water wake up a nice citrus note (like orange bitters or grapefruit) in the aroma, without compromising the integrity of the flavor. I recommend a few drops of water. Also, this bodes well for Bulleit’s ability to stand up to ice or mixers.', ': A very respectable rye. I like finding those piney/eucalyptus notes in younger ryes, and Bulleit has those in addition to some of the spicy/oaky flavors present in older ryes. I still prefer ']"

93,Bushmills (10 year) Single-Malt Irish Whiskey ,"[': Sharp nose, somewhat acidic (lemony). Some mild tropical fruit notes – green banana, kiwi, coconut – and a slight industrial edge, like Redbreast but less pleasant. Not much depth.', ': Syrupy body, with tons of fresh coconut meat. A downright Piña Colada at first. The flavors fade on the tongue, leaving only that industrial grime note.', ': On the short side. Remnants of coconut oil, charcoal, and something chemical – like glue. Not bitter, exactly, but the aftertaste is off-putting.', ': The addition of water freshens the tropical fruit notes on the nose (which had seemed to fade in the glass), adding perhaps an indistinct floral note or two. Otherwise, it is unchanged.', ': For nearly $50, I highly do not recommend this. It is run-of-the-mill in terms of unique flavors, and very shallow. It has a few Redbreast-like qualities, but without Redbreast’s depth of flavor and intensity. Any oloroso barrels involved in the maturation do not seem to have had an effect on the final product. You would be far, far better spending your money on ']"
94,Bushmills Black Bush Blended Irish Whiskey ,"[': A gentle sherry presence greets the nose – with fresh apple cider, young fruity red wine, and champagne grapes. A hint of cereal grains and bakery goods, like scones, but not overly sweet.', ': Mild and thin. A bit of grape jelly, and more non-sweet baked goods… English muffins? Otherwise, same notes as on the nose. A bit sweeter on the tongue – with more caramel than anticipated. A hint of acetone, but only a hint.', ': Medium-long. The grain is more present here, with a bite of young, medicinal grain alcohol, but that passes quickly and the finish fades pleasantly with grape skins and red wine tannins.', ': A splash of water wakes up more fruit notes, with red currants, unripe figs, and dried cranberries. However, it makes the palate dreadfully thin and watery. At 40% ABV, this hardly requires watering. Note that while Black Bush makes quite nice cocktails and is excellent on the rocks, it does suffer a little from melting ice. Try a large ice cube or a straight-up cocktail rather than something with a lot of water.', ': Black Bush is probably the most successful inexpensive blended whisky on the market that I’ve had, with the sole exception of ']"
95,Bushmills Original Blended Irish Whiskey ,"[': Black pepper, faint dried coconut. Asphalt. Charcoal. Oatmeal.', ': Mildly creamy body, with more black pepper up front, and a suggestion of marshmallow. Pleasant cereal flavors on the tongue, without any depth at all.', ': Some brown sugar and oats on the finish. Very short.', ': This isn’t awful. It’s a simple, single-note dram with no complexity, but not as faulty as others at this price point. The black pepper on the nose is interesting, and the raw grain whiskey doesn’t announce itself on the tongue like other competitors do. While it doesn’t have the brash racy flavor of Jameson, it wins in smoothness and simplicity. Still, I would not buy a bottle of this for the purpose of drinking it neat, and would rather spend the extra $10 to $20 on some inexpensive sipping whisky (starting with the lower-end single malt scotches).']"
96,Canadian Club 100% Rye ,"[': Very soft, nonthreatening grain, with a sweet envelope of vanilla, bubblegum, and honeysuckle. This auspicious start is marred by a flash of acetone (nail polish remover), betraying its youth. ', ': Soft, supple, and creamy body. Quite a bit hotter than I’d expect at 40% ABV. The palate offers more sweet grains and a teasing of jammy fruits, but not much else.', ': Short. Vanilla sweet and floral, with more honeysuckle and some orange blossom. Pleasant and not bitter, but quick.', ': Water might bring a little bit of caramel to the palate, rounding out the sweet flavors and taming a little of the tongue burn, but is otherwise unhelpful. If you don’t like this at first sip, throw in some water to see if it improves.', ': To me, this feels like an attempt to compete with ']"
97,Caol Ila (12 year) ,"[': Wet bog, a dominant peatiness that seems more like wet leaves, humus, and decaying fallen trees than smoke or sea. Very light oakiness underneath, with only a thin layer of malt serving as a vehicle for the peat. Caol Ila has a reputation for being one of the “lightest” examples of Islay peat, but I would say that the peat here is simply less brash and smokey. There’s no denying that the dominant note here is peat.', ': Soft in texture, but with a lot of tongue burn for 43% ABV. The peat is subdued on the palate, revealing instead waves of chocolatey malt and a bit of nutty oak.', ': Medium-Long. The peat becomes almost fruity, with a hint of strawberry jam. Chocolate fudge and hazelnut butter. Tasty.', ': A few drops of water make the peat more pungent, but don’t affect its character. The water might tame the tongue burn somewhat. It certainly doesn’t hurt.', ': The nose is a little off-putting for me, even though I enjoy peat. The muddiness and earthy quality of the peat seems “lower quality” to me than the peat of other Islay distilleries. However, that all changes on the tongue, where the peat gives way to a very tasty chocolate note. This continues through the finish, which has the strangest merging of boggy peat, strawberry jam, and chocolate fudge. Weird, but very satisfying. I would score this higher if the nose were either more clear and refined, or less peaty. Either way, the rest of the experience makes up for it.']"
98,Caol Ila (18 year) ,"[': Smoke-forward vanilla-laden Caol Ila peat, like a fragrant just-snuffed candle. Sandalwood, blanched almonds, and butterscotch pudding. Downright elegant.', ': Medium-weight, almost oily mouthfeel. Sweet upfront (more pudding), with a sedate tongue burn. Sweet wood, pungent peat smoke with herbal notes.', ': Long. Caramel or nougat, charcoal, bitter herbs (like cocktail bitters) that linger for basically ever, along with the remaining wisps of smoke.', ': The addition of a few drops of water seems to initially mute the aroma, requiring a rest in the glass. After, the aroma seems unchanged by the water. The palate might be thinner, and offers slightly more tongue burn. The water adds a menthol note to the finish. I suggest skipping the water with this one.', ': 18 years in oak has not seemed to dull the Caol Ila peat like it does in other Islay malts. That same vanilla-laden peat smoke is accompanied by a greater amount of wood sugars and caramelly (it’s a real word damn you, spellcheck) notes than younger Caol Ilas, and they meld harmoniously. That sandalwood note on the aroma, the vanilla throughout, and the oily mouthfeel are highlights. I could wish for the finish to have a little less of that bitter herb flavor, but it is really a problem easily solved by taking another sip. I could also wish for a push higher in ABV, as 43% is a little lackluster for an 18 year-old release. That said, the price is not outrageous. Depending on exchange rates, it can be had for around $90 to $100, which is what we all USED to pay for 18 year-old single malt scotches.']"
99,Caol Ila (18 year) Unpeated – (Special Release 2017) ,"[': A flurry of fruit (tropical in nature: mango, kiwi, passion fruit), which settles after a rest in the glass into a sedate lemon-lime affair flecked with vanilla and a well-rounded custardy sweetness. A twinge of smoke – not peat! – and delicate florals add interest. Despite the high ABV, the nose tickle is under control.', ': Syrupy body. Oaky upfront, with a sultry layer of mossy (but not smoky) peat. The tongue burn is fierce and numbing, but is accompanied by a fiery note of cinnamon and stonefruit – plum? This subsides into a typical banana-and-vanilla ex-bourbon flavor profile with a pleasant earthy note like freshly-dug garden soil.', ': Medium-long. Faint licorice, some oaky spices (including the cinnamon), and a large helping of somewhat bitter charcoal which obscures the rest of the finish, the only mar in an otherwise excellent dram. Fades with a ghost of menthol.', ': A splash of water adds a tutti-frutti or bubble gum note to the aroma, and melds the fruits into a cohesive sweet dessert-like package. The water thins the body somewhat, and does very little to tame the tongue burn. I think you’d have to aggressively water it down to achieve that. The finish is a little brighter and sweeter – again with the bubble gum. I suggest at least smelling a dram at full-strength before adding any water. Progressively add small amounts of water – allowing each time to meld – until the tongue burn is acceptable to you.', ': Do I lose my blogger cred if I say I like this better than the peated version? Do I have any blogger cred? This has a phenomenal whirl of fruit, a bit of sweetness, a bit of smoke, and robust texture and flavor. I could wish for a little less bitterness on the finish, but the entirety is well worth the price tag (and the experiment of leaving the peat out of a peated classic). It goes well with a splash or two of water. Either way this is a contemplative, multi-layered dram which completely does not make me miss the peat.']"
100,Caol Ila Moch ,"[': Meaty Caol Ila peat wafts from the bottle as soon as it’s opened. Potent, ocean-flecked, smoky peat dominates. An undercurrent of vanilla and light honey balances the peat perfectly.', ': Thin body. Sweet, at first, but the sweetness recedes and peat – now a little ashy – pervades. Bitter barrel char, earthy almost-fungal peat, a hint of tobacco leaf, and campfire smoke are the main flavors.', ': Long. Many of the flavors drop away, leaving wood smoke and a tingle of menthol and a dollop of black licorice.', ': A few drops of water initially mute the aroma. Give it some time in the glass. Even after it comes back, though, the water doesn’t seem to add anything. I wouldn’t suggest water with this dram.', ': I mean, it’s definitely Caol Ila. The youth comes through in some slightly-too-ashy and slightly-too-vegetal notes here and there, but I’ve always thought that peated drams benefit from a little youth. Still, I drink this and can’t help but miss some of the more polished elements of the older 12 year. If this were substantially cheaper than the 12 year I could call it a good value… but it seems the prices are similar.']"

102,Chieftain’s: Mortlach (18 year) 1997 – 2015 ,"[': Dense, dark, sticky resin. Jammy and thick, with notes of cooked blackberry, plum/prune, fig, and not-quite-rancio notes of shoe leather, wood rot, and old wax. Not sweet, but there are notes of dense torte and fudge. Prominent nose tickle. A rest in the glass brightens the fruit a bit.', ': Thin body. More jam, although the palate is austere and flavors seem sparse. Red wine vinegar… old-vine Zinfandel… port wine reduction… coffee grounds… ', ': Somewhat short. A dominant grape skin note, complete with red wine tannins and a bramble-like woodiness. Dusty. The finish happens quickly, leaving only the taste of old, wet attic behind. Clearly a sense memory from my own life, because that taste descriptor sounds downright daft. “I get a soupçon of wet attic.” Bah. Get over yourself, Noob.', ': Several drops of water increase the nose tickle but don’t seem to affect the aroma. The palate is a little more coherent, with fewer “dark” or resin-like notes and more fruity high notes. There is more caramel on the finish, and it might hold together longer. Try without water, and then add just a little to see how it changes for you.', ': Not as meaty or profound as some other Mortlachs that I’ve had. Luckily it is not noticeably sulfured, but the notes are eclectic and inconsistent, like a tapestry riddled with holes. A good example of the kind of thing that filters through the secondary market for single malt barrels without making a fuss, and probably would have performed much better as the sherry notes in a high-end blend. You aren’t going to find it anywhere, but at $99+ you’re not missing out.']"
103,Chivas Regal (12 year) Blended Scotch ,[]
104,Clyde May’s Straight Bourbon ,"[': A mid-line bourbon with an interesting tart high note. Cherry, light corn and grains, not aggressive.', ': Thin body. Woody upfront, with a mild tongue burn. The oak is bold and complex but borders on cardboardy (nope, not a word) and there’s a lot of it, obscuring the more delicate whiskey notes. Edging toward dry, but with just enough (oaky) sweetness to keep balance.', ': Medium-long. Nutty, with the oak taking a backseat, contributing only some welcome drying tannins. Some bitterness (probably from all that oak) creeps in at the end. Pleasant, but commonplace.', ': A few drops of water make the aroma oddly shy, even after several minutes of rest. The water brings some nuttiness to the palate, and thins the oak enough to bring out complexity. I suggest giving it a good smell before adding the water, which does help make the whiskey coherent on the tongue.', ': A decidedly middle-of-the-road bourbon. The cherry notes are nice, but rote, and the palate would be well-balanced if it weren’t for a heavy hand with the oak. For what it’s worth, it also makes a very acceptable (indeed, slightly above-average) Old Fashioned, where those oak notes are welcome and stand up to bitters nicely. I marked this “Try Before Buy” because this is $35 not $20, but if that doesn’t bother you, the bourbon is just fine, and you won’t likely be disappointed.']"
105,Clynelish (14 year) ,"[': Fresh ripe plums, red grapes, indeed a whole fruit punch barely masking deep, nutty barley. A sour high note stands out – similar to Highland Park’s floral peatiness, this hint of citrus is very well-integrated – so much so that I didn’t realize the malt was peated at first. Everyone else detects a note of brine – but I’m not getting it. A very robust, multi-layered aroma, and one that stands up to a lot of analysis.', ': Somewhat thin mouthfeel, but also soft with round, welcoming flavors of caramel. The peat notes dance on the palate – sprightly and bright – while the whole evolves to a saltwater taffy-like interplay of sweet, salty, and fruity. I love a whisky that changes – progresses – on the tongue, and this does it better than most.', ': Ahh, now I get the brine. Like the taste of seawater in your mouth after swimming in the ocean. Drying, and more smoky now. Black pepper, sticky dates, and salted caramels. A twist of bitter lemon peel on the exit. Relatively short finish, except for the lemon peel.', ': Adds candied lemon peel to the nose, thins the already-thin palate, burns a bit more than expected on the tongue, and does little for the finish. I don’t see any reason to add water to this, although a sip of water AFTER a sip of malt plays nicely – mitigating that bitter lemon peel note.', ': This reminds me of Old Pulteney – with a chameleon-like shifting from briney and smoky to soft and sweet to fruity and sour. While eclectic, I cannot call it disjointed. The transitions between personalities is seamless, and the experience whole. I’ve never had anything quite like Clynelish, and I think it’s an experience that any serious malt drinker should have.']"
106,Colonel E.H. Taylor Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': Shy, even after a rest in the glass. The overall impression is mellow corn sweetness, with a delectable assortment of floral notes and subtle caramels and fudges. Very little nose tickle, even deep in the glass. Definitely subtle, but also complex – there’s a lot to pick apart in there.', ': Syrupy body with a silk-like texture. A mild (for 50% ABV) tongue burn is followed by light oaky tannins, more corn-based sugars and caramels, mildly bitter nut skins and almond butter. A second taste reveals lightly tart fresh cherries.', ': Of medium length. The same silky mellowness translates to the finish, which is nearly devoid of bitterness and simply continues most of the flavor notes. I could wish for a bit more evolution here, but that’s splitting hairs.', ': A few drops of water initially sap the aroma of any presence, so give it a little time after adding water. The water seems to add a nice taffy note, and also a pretty ', ': An excellently solid if laid-back bourbon for a price that shows that Buffalo Trace knows its quality. You’re not getting a deal, for sure, but you are getting your money’s worth. The whiskey is more impressively mellow when you compare it to other 100-proof bourbons. It’s also better than some “craft” $50 bourbons that I’ve had. Colonel E.H. Taylor is different enough from other ‘standards’ on the market that I’m marking it a “Must Try”. This is especially a must if you’ve grown tired of the overly-oaked overly-brash bourbons that are common on shelves these days.']"
107,Compass Box – 3 Year Old Deluxe ,"[': Uhh. Wow? Passion fruit and intense florals: Like walking into a flower shop full of drifting pollen. Waxy (hello, Clynelish!) natural beeswax candles. Full of enticing juicy exotic fruits on a bed of light unassuming marshmallow malt. Despite the age of the components, the effect is not of “old whisky” but rather “perfect whisky” – the aroma is hands-down flawless.', ': Medium syrupy body. Entirely without tongue burn (“smooth”). More beeswax, plus a reprise of the fruit-salad promised by the aroma. Bubblegum, honey, fruit cordial, and meringue.', ': Medium-short. Warming. Tart peach and vanilla frosting. Fades with sweet cherry and shortcake. No bitterness.', ': A few drops of water punch up the tart fruits and add white tea and a hint of green banana. The water also adds a layer of silky vanilla fondant to the palate, which makes it fuller. It also (finally!) lets slip a hint of peat on the finish, which is muted but delicately smoky – like the smoke from a fruit-flavored hookah tobacco.', ': Possibly the most decadent aroma I’ve ever experienced in a whisky. This is master blending at its unremitting finest. It probably helps that I could drink well-chosen ']"
108,Compass Box – Flaming Heart (5th Edition) ,"[': Clear, crisp lemony peat. Oily, tart, and waxy. After a rest in the glass, there might be a hint of menthol.', ': Wow. Meaty/chewy, with lemon rind, tart lemon meringue pie. Nearly sparkles on the tongue. Elegantly smoky, with refined clean-burning peat smoke and sea breeze.', ': Medium-long. Lemon continues, with roasted chestnuts and spent campfire. Fades with very little bitterness.', ': A little water enhances the waxy “crayon” aroma which is uniquely Clynelish. It also brings out a little coconut and mutes the smoke on the nose. The palate and finish seem unchanged. A little water is advisable, but try it without first.', ': A majestic whisky, with elegance, freshness, and complexity all given equal share. The crisp, tart lemon flavors pervade the experience, and perfectly counterpoint the restrained-but-evident nature of the peat smoke. The peat is pristine, with no muddiness, bitterness or off-flavors, and the entirety is well-balanced from start to finish. This is one of those rare whiskies that makes you say “Wow” out loud when given a whiff, and never contradicts that first impression. Well done, sir.']"
109,Compass Box – Peat Monster (2019 Edition) ,"[': A monster indeed. Unlike the previous PM release, I can tell at first glance that this is nearly all Islay malt. Seagrass and iodine from Laphroaig with campfire and sweet roasty vanilla from Caol Ila. The balance is sublime, although the edge in style points goes to Laphroaig, which wins the arm wrestle.', ': Thin body. Smoked seaweed is in the fore (a point to Laphroaig!), with undercurrents of smoked jerky, vanilla, toasted nuts, and briny pickle juice.', ': Long. A continuation of the previous notes. One more point to Laphroaig, which is still dominant. Bitterness is minimal (despite both of these malts tending to carry some), and the finish fades very slowly with only slight changes to the smoke. At the tail end, Caol Ila dominates with puffy vanilla clouds and charcoal dust.', ': A few drops of water initially wash out the aroma, which recovers. The water doesn’t have much effect on the rest, except perhaps amping up the smoke on the palate and finish. Water optional.', ': It is fascinating (to me, but I’m weird like that) to find that a 35% proportion of Laphroaig would take over the aroma and flavor profiles against a 64% proportion of Caol Ila. The final effect is a very successful blend, where Laphroaig takes center stage and is supported with the depth and fullness of Caol Ila. The best of both worlds, if you will, but you kind of have to already be a Laphroaig fan to enjoy those iodine notes.']"
110,Compass Box – Spice Tree ,"[': Lemon balm, candle wax, (hello, Clynelish!). White fruits (white peach or white mulberries or something), delicate peachy florals, and light, airy honey. A simple aromatic pleasure, and totally devoid of anything I would call “spice”. After a rest in the glass, some green banana.', ': Syrupy, waxy body. Sweet and honeyed. More peach, with some dessert wine flavors (riesling maybe). White sangria. On the back side of the palate, something nutty… maybe hazelnuts, and a bare touch of oak that comes across as stale cinnamon sticks. Maybe this is the “Spice”?', ': Short. Fading fruits, now dried apricot and tannic white tea. These fade cleanly and without bitterness.', ': A scant few drops of water dumps puréed banana all over the aroma. This dissipates to reveal an herby anise note and some coconut. The rest of the experience is unchanged. Water optional here, it really doesn’t need it. Note that after a longer rest, I’m able to detect the candied ginger and gingerbread notes alluded to in the marketing.', ': Spice be damned, this is a wonderfully pleasant dram. I’m a sucker for peach flavors in a whisky, and doubly so for the unique waxy texture and aroma that Clynelish brings to the table. I could wish for a little heavier dose of that nutty French Oak flavor. Of Compass Box’s regular vatted (sorry – “blended malt”) scotch releases, this is probably the best. At $70, it’s pricey, but doesn’t disappoint. I will probably buy a full bottle of this for serving after special meals.']"
111,Compass Box – Spice Tree Extravaganza ,"[': The sherry is apparent – full bright red fruits, with a hint of darker preserves. A blanket of vanilla cake frosting pervades all, but is studded with cloves and wisps of sandalwood. Overall, malty and light with aspects of spice and sherry. A rest in the glass reveals some just-ripe banana.', ': Full bodied. Beeswax (Clynelish), but with a huge spike of baking spices (clove, cinnamon, mace, and especially nutmeg) and fresh hay. This passes, leaving cinnamon bun (with frosting), and ruby port.', ': Of medium length. Nutty, with more jam notes. Not exactly peanut-butter-and-jelly… more like hazelnut-butter-and-fig-jam. Fades relatively quickly, leaving singed cloves and sweet oak.', ': A few drops of water mute the sherry notes (alas), while highlighting some French Oak characteristics (cinnamon, vanilla, sandalwood). The palate has a little more cinnamon and vibrancy, the finish a little more malty caramel. Still, you should try this without water first. You probably won’t need to add any. ', ': A very tasty, if not exactly overwhelming blended malt. I expected to be wowed like I was with ']"
112,Compass Box – Story of the Spaniard (Batch 1) ,"[': Almost (but not quite) a sherry bomb. Sweet and unctuous and syrupy sherry, with the usual dried-and-jammed fruit notes of fig and plum and apricot. Caramel, sweet honeyed malt, and maple syrup. Dense and enticing.', ': Thin body. Sweet and fruity upfront, with all the notes promised by the aroma. Figs, dates, Christmas cake, plump raisins, and not-quite-resinous balsamic.', ': Medium-short. Some red wine tannins, with a dash of oak and a hint of bramble. Fades quickly without evolving.', ': A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma without adding anything. There is, perhaps, some vanilla buttercream frosting. Maybe. The palate is similarly watered-down and… you know what? Just skip the water.', ': A fine sherry bomb. The Spanish red wine casks are noticeable, but thankfully do not impede the flow of the whisky like many red wine finishes I’ve tasted in the past. They seem to contribute tannins and some fresh fruit notes without becoming overly bitter or uhh… “red winey”? There is a very manageable amount of bitter tannin here, and an abundance of delectable sweet sherry notes. If it were $40, it would be my new go-to sherry bomb. At $60, it’s something I might consider purchasing when I’m in the mood. At that price-point, it competes with a lot of excellent sherried whisky. ']"
113,Compass Box – Stranger & Stranger ,"[': Extra shy right out of the bottle. Give it time in the glass. Even then, the aroma is akin to freshly-dried laundry. Airy, light, and slightly but complexly fragrant. Green apple and/or apple blossom, vanilla, lemon peel, and green banana.', ': Soft, medium bodied. Densely, surprisingly, fruity. Juicy plums, apricots, apple cider, green pears, and melty caramel. On second tasting, banana cream pie.', ': Medium length. A bit of a muddle. Green grapes… fresh banana… whipped cream… kiwi… and confectioner’s sugar. There is no bitterness. A weird one.', ': A few drops of water amp the nose tickle more than I like. The water adds a banana bread note. I would skip the water, unless you want to experiment and see if you can make sense out of this.', ': I… What? This is a confusing dram. I started out thinking it was arid and lacking aroma. Next, I found it to be bursting with juicy fresh fruits on the palate. Then, I find a confusing muddle of disconnected notes on the finish.']"
114,Compass Box – The Circle No. 1 ,"[': Light and apple-y, like a very fragrant hard cider. Floral, with a ton of honeysuckle and clover flowers. As it sits in the glass, the fruit evolves through white peach, tart white (Rainier) cherries, and finally to caramel apple. There are notes of nougat, vanilla taffy, and white chocolate. Lovely, but very subtle.', ': Thick, syrupy body. Waxy Clynelish malt up front, with dense nougat and peanut fudge. Very little tongue burn. It takes awhile for the sherry notes to appear – mostly as dried apple and slightly bitter grape skin tannins. I do not detect any peat from the Highland Park (if that’s what it is).', ': Medium length. More nougat, but only a whisper of the fruit notes from the aroma. Some bitterness (oak and/or charcoal). Fades with a bit of charcoal and a swath of licorice (anise). On subsequent tastings, I find a nice thick layer of sweet malty barley (like breakfast cereal) here.', ': A few drops of water bring the dried apple notes to the aroma, but mute some of the subtle floral notes. The palate and finish both get a little more tart bite. Try without water first, and then add just a little to see how it changes for you.', ': The apple notes are subtle and harmonious on the aroma, which is fantastic. The palate mostly seems like your average Compass Box blended malt, and the finish is sparse but solid. The sherried components are very mild, providing slight fruit notes rather than a fruit-forward character. This fits the bill as a “Summer” drink – light and complex and fun. “Sunshine in a glass” is a very accurate description.']"
115,Compass Box – The Lost Blend ,"[': A tangy dose of Caol Ila peat meets the nose, accompanied by the clear, sweet aroma of peach. Yum. Waxy Clynelish underscores both, with its uncanny combination of candlewax and vanilla. The two are playful, and thankfully not overly smoky or earthy. The combination is ethereal.', ': Waxy body, and the charry smoke of Caol Ila cuts through immediately. There is a light, chardonnay-like fruitiness underscored by buttery toasted oak. Again, the smoke and fruit take turns at the forefront, neither washing the other out or becoming muddied.', ': Medium-long and warming. The peat continues to smoulder as it goes to charcoal. The fruit fades quickly, leaving no bitterness.', ': A few drops of water punch up the peat smoke and also reveal something floral, like lavender. Certainly try this with a few drops.', ': This is (if memory serves) much more successful than Eleuthera was at both taming Islay smoke and marrying it to fruit. The clean, crisp notes of peach and white grapes carry through from nose to finish, never allowing the peat to dominate. Masterfully blended – a truly excellent example of skilled blending and what it can accomplish.']"
116,Compass Box – This is Not a Luxury Whisky ,"[': Supple – like new leather – and not at all hot. Ripe bananas, dried apricots. Subtle smoke, cocoa nibs. Deep in the glass there’s something buttery that reminds me of chocolate croissants.', ': Creamy and silky. Entry is a little hot. Marzipan, smoked almonds, muted campfire smoke. Sherry comes across as desiccated figs, nearly devoid of sweetness but resinous and umami. A hint of barnyard (old hay).', ': Long. Quite bitter, like Campari without the sugar, or very strong black coffee. Charcoal. Fades with salty wisps of smoke.', ': A few drops of water bring out a nice caramel roundness and balances out the heavy banana. Now the predominant aroma is of salted caramels. The same is true of the palate, which burns less and has a touch more sweetness that provides better balance. It’s amazing that only 4% by volume of Caol Ila could have yielded so much peaty smoke in the blend.', ': I’m torn (cue the Natalie Imbruglia). I expected some luxurious sherry notes, but found them mostly dried up. I expected a faint echo of peat from the Caol Ila, and found it bathed in smoke, especially on the tongue. Added water brought some much-needed balance, but still I suspect that slightly-peated blends, even of this calibre and advanced age, are not my cup of tea.']"
117,Compass Box Asyla ,"[': Evident Clynelish – waxy, vegetal, vanilla. This actually reminds me of a (really nice) Reposado Tequila. Deeper in, a hint of lime juice or lemon peel. The aroma is sparse, but clean.', ': A slight creaminess – certainly not thin. Vanilla returns, and a layer of cereal sweetness.', ': Short, but with some nice marshmallow, vanilla custard, and cream soda flavors. No bitterness.', ': A few drops of water seems to draw out the “new make” aspect of the younger components – revealing more cut grass or raw cane sugar types of notes. Water thins the palate, adding nothing, and is similarly ineffective for the finish. This needs no water.', ': This is a clean, crisp, and borderline bland example of what skillful hands can do with young or inexpensive whisky blending components. Although similar in price, it is far more clean and elegant than most blended scotch on the planet. However, its clean lines leave very little behind in terms of flavor or complexity. If you’re looking for an inexpensive blend without a lot of character, but without any obvious flaws, this is a good one to try.']"
118,Compass Box Eleuthera ,[]
119,Compass Box Hedonism ,"[': Sweet dairy cream, malted milk balls, fresh yeasty bakery bread. Vanilla in spades. Lots of nose tickle – practically crawls up your sinuses. Deep in there is a paint thinner quality, but it is masked by the immediate creamy sweetness of the grain.', ': Immensely creamy body. Cinnamon, nutmeg, powdered sugar. Depths of vanilla custard and almond butter.', ': Crisp and clean, if somewhat brief. Shortbread, marzipan and roasted almonds. No bitterness to speak of. Very elegant.', ': A splash of water brings an almost gin-like flush of herbs and green grass notes to the nose, without thinning the body too much. It loses some of its sweetness on the tongue, though, and appears to have less depth. I suggest trying a few drops of water in your last sip, but not the whole glass.', ': I don’t know if I’d call it hedonistic, but this is a prime example of what can be done with skillful blending and excellent grain whiskies. The nose is light and sweet, the flavor is packed with bakery sweets and spices, and the finish is crisp, elegant, and flawless. It reminds me of the company’s newer product, ']"
120,Compass Box Hedonism Quindecimus ,"[': Wow. Even at only 46%, this takes your nose by storm. A cacophony of mown hay, aloe vera, exotic dried citrus peels, vanilla bean, violets, that thing that’s been giving me seasonal allergies for the past week, and six or seven other aromas I can’t name. Complex, evolving, and fascinating.', ': Mildly creamy body. Slightly grassy, but backed up with fresh vanilla, sugar cane, cream of wheat, and coconut-flour cake. Quite sweet on the back palate, but not cloying.', ': Long. A reprise of the palate – mostly vanilla and sugar cane, but with a few hints of the potpourri of aromas. Fades with coconut, and is never bitter.', ': A few drops of water actually hide some of the fainter aromas. I don’t recommend any water with this – it certainly doesn’t need it.', ': Unreal. A testament to the blender’s skill, and irrefutable proof that grain whisky can be ethereal. Personally, I don’t conclude from this that grain whisky in general is good, but that most blenders are clearly cutting costs and using inferior grain. Why can’t more blended whisky taste even slightly like this?']"
121,Compass Box Oak Cross ,"[': Honeyed, with bold notes of ground cloves, fresh vanilla bean, yeasty bread, and a distant whiff of rooty, earthy peat.', ': Soft and shy at first. Spice notes awaken, echoing the clove but adding cinnamon and black pepper. Dried ginger rounds out the spices, but clashes somewhat with them.', ': Peppery and drying, and of medium length. A smudge of fresh soil, a dash of toasting spices, a twist of something bitter and herbal.', ': Crystallized ginger. A bit maltier on the nose and the palate, which brings out a coating of caramel and helps to tame the spiciness. It’s better, on the whole, with water, although the interesting uniqueness of the clove notes get lost.', ': For once, the marketing babble hits a tasting note square on: a heady mix of perfumy vanilla and spicy ground cloves! Oak Cross reads like a scholarly essay on the effects of different woods on whisky, with a lot of technical detail and passion for the subject. Alas, the effect of such varied spice notes – sometimes clashing – is to shake up my palate and force me to analyze each distinct element without allowing me to appreciate the integrated whole. With Oak Cross, there is a lot of flavor, but not a lot of coherency.']"
122,Concannon Blended Irish Whiskey ,"[': Mildly winey, with sour red raspberries, red grape skins, and an unfortunate waft of antiseptic. Minimum nose tickle. Under the sour fruits is a layer of soft cereal grains and vanilla cake frosting. Overall, the aroma is inoffensive, but not outstanding.', ': Thin, watery body. Somewhat more burn than I’d expect from a 40% ABV product. Wine influence is not apparent. Vaguely grain-like. Bland.', ': Medium-length. Warming, but thin. A hint of the red grape skins returns, and a bit of vanilla oakiness, which fades, leaving very little bitterness from the barrel – a plus.', ': Usually it’s not a good idea to add water to a 40% ABV dram. Here, it adds some very mild florals to the nose, but washes out what little flavor there was. On the upside, it becomes particularly “smooth” (whatever that means) and easy to drink. A bland cocktail, but much better than some cheap whiskeys that get far worse with water. Worth a try with water for experimentation’s sake.', ': It seems odd to me to take a measure of substandard Cooley whiskey and make the effort to age it in wine barrels. I have to wonder if this was an attempt to save some particularly uninteresting barrels of whiskey? The underlying spirit here is far less interesting than ']"
123,Connemara (12 year) ,"[': Green, vegetal peat. This is just how I imagine smoked cucumber would smell, if such a thing existed. The peat smells like it was composed entirely of green leafy things decomposed in inland bogs (no sea notes). Lime peel. Watery.', ': Medium-bodied. Light malt with fresh tobacco leaf, birch beer, and loads of black pepper. No off-notes, but austere.', ': Long. Vanilla. Earthy, meaty peat finally, with notes of roasted mushrooms and tofu. Mild, cake-dough cereal note. No bitterness.', ': A few drops of water intensifies the cucumber note, and adds a thin layer of vanilla sweetness to the palate. Water doesn’t hurt here.', ': Not in the same category as peated Islay malts in this price range, which have depth of flavor and complexity beyond what this Connemara can reach. Still, it is an interesting take on a peated single malt, and is well-crafted without bitterness or off-notes. Notable for its individuality among the Irish category, but not something that your average malt-head will choose over an Islay malt like ']"
124,Copper Dog ,"[': Lemony, with a strong scent of lemon peel, tart – but sweet – malt, and not much else.', ': Thin body, and quite watery. Lemonade, roasted peanuts, and toast. A total absence of tongue burn. This would be quite tasty if it weren’t so watered-down and bland.', ': Short. Slightly bitter, with a lot of charcoal. This is balanced somewhat by nutty, sweet malt… like peanut butter-flavored candies. Fades quickly and abruptly without evolving.', ': Really? Water? Ok, I’ll try it for consistency’s sake… A scant few drops of water muddy the previously clear lemon note on the aroma, and predictably render the palate even more bland. I suppose there is an additional note of pound cake (or marshmallow?) on the tongue and finish, but it’s not worth the extra dilution.', ': Meh. A few nice notes that are belied by a bitter finish and completely washed out by an overeager hand with the bottle-proofing water. I actually checked, twice, to be sure this wasn’t under 40% ABV. The blending is well-done for a sub-$40 blended malt, but I find ']"

Some slight charcoal flavors and a fading tinge of cinnamon and menthol.', ': A drop of water seems to drown out the fruits and florals, replacing them with maybe a little cinnamon. The palate seems unchanged, as does the finish. I would not bother with water here – the bottle proof is perfect.', ': Exceptional for $29 bourbon, especially if you prefer a lighter style of whisky with more florals and fruits than woody sugars. Corner Creek Reserve is summer whiskey: refreshing, almost thirst-quenching in its presentation, and arrives at a well-chosen 44% ABV which delivers sparkling flavors without overwhelming the palate.']"

After a rest in the glass, some ripe banana notes creep in.', ': Medium body. An initial wave of banana and toffee is accompanied by a very mild tongue burn. Then, slightly bitter and slightly smoky barrel char, oak chips, and burnt caramel.', ': On the short side. A very consistent finish, comprising the good notes from the nose and palate, but without much bitterness. Unfortunately it fades quickly, without evolving.', ': A few drops of water release a nice orange peel note which merges well with the caramel. The palate seems thinner, the finish livelier. Water is a good idea with this malt.', ': A fairly one-dimensional malt that is somewhat marred by my least-favorite flavor note (banana). The wood is nice, as are the well-balanced sugar notes that verge on toasty toffee and caramel, but there isn’t much else to recommend it.']"

Light and fragrant, with some nondescript flowers, soft grains, nougat, and an aroma I can only describe as ', ': Medium bodied. Banana candy (Runts), marshmallows, nutmeg, mulled cider, and faint oak. No burn to speak of (“smooth”).', ': Medium-long. Red apple skins, mouth-drying tannins, fading without bitterness.', ': A few drops of water bring out some vanilla in the aroma, and make the finish a little fruitier. I could take or leave water with this.', ': An inoffensive whisky, without the usual rye flavors (there’s no cinnamon, no clove, no eucalyptus/mint) but with a plethora of nostalgia-inducing fruit and candy flavors. Unlike the standard Crown Royal, I do not detect any “fake” corn-syrup-like notes, nor any young column-still grainy characteristics (acetone). This is not too sweet, not too spicy, and scary easy to drink. I certainly wouldn’t call this the best whisky of 2016, or even the best Canadian whisky I’ve had, but it is a good blended rye at a fantastic price, and I’m looking forward to the remaining 700mls in the bottle. My award? “2016 Best Effort To Improve Its Reputation by a Mass-Market Blended Whisky Producer”. Headlines, here I come!']"
131,Crown Royal Reserve Canadian Whisky ,"[': Some Rye spiciness, with soft overtones of brown sugar and maple syrup. Slightly bourbon-like, although not as robust.', ': Thin body. Maple again. A bit watery. Slightly woody, slightly sweet.', ': Nutty, but with a twinge of bitterness. Aftertaste of artificial sweeteners.', ': Too watery. Even a little bit of water kills the nose and washes out the palate.', ': An ice cube sweetens it, but dilutes the flavor. As with most iced whiskeys, do this only if you dislike the flavor of straight whiskey.', ': Not objectionable. The flavors are mild. It tastes a bit like an American rye, but watered down and sweetened. Possibly not worth the money unless you already love Crown Royal and want a direct upgrade. If you are looking to experiment with Canadian whiskies, I would suggest starting with Forty Creek instead.']"
132,Cut Spike Nebraska Single Malt (2 year) ,"[': Intensely sweet butterscotch and toffee. If a nose can do a double-take, mine just did. This doesn’t smell like 2 year-old paint thinner in wood, this smells like deeply mature malt whisky with a lot of oak influence. Vanilla fudge, white chocolate, and “blondie” brownies. Deeper in, there’s a faint sappy green wood, like freshly-snapped saplings. Sweet and flawless. Wow.', ': Soft and supple. Maple sugar candies! A reprise of the aroma, but with endless waves of bakery treats, caramels, vanilla, and a whallop of oak tannin. Is it malt whisky? Is it bourbon? Somehow, it’s the best of both. No tongue burn to speak of.', ': Medium/Short. The sweet notes drop away quickly, leaving a little drying tannin and some faint herbal flavors, like mint or menthol. No bitterness.', ': At 43% ABV, this is hardly crying out for water. A few drops seem to (oddly) dampen the sweetness and add only a hint of charcoal. On the tongue, the water seems to draw up tannins and even a little bitterness. I don’t see any need for water here.', ': Unreal. Who knew that if you took Nebraska water, malted barley, and new charred American oak, you could make magic? And in only two years! I was hooked at first sip, and now halfway through the bottle I can’t believe I ever lived without it. Cut Spike has exactly the right amount of wood character – aging this any longer under the same conditions could make for an overly woody, muddied mess. 43% ABV seems perfect for mouthfeel, body, intensity of flavor, and lack of burn. It has less harsh, acrid notes than most bourbons, and more flavor than most malt whiskies aged in reused wood. There is no hint of acetone or vodka-like flavors despite the young age. It is, perhaps, a little on the sweet side for those who prefer drier spirits, and the finish seems a little lightweight. Those are nitpicks, though. This is easily the best American spirit I’ve had short of ', ': I did not have enough liquid to perform a full review, so I thought I’d add some notes here for people looking in the store at a “batch 2” of Cut Spike. Batch 2 is wildly different – night and day – from batch 1. It features a dominant soapy perfume note of lavender dish soap, sweet and tart tropical fruits (passion fruit, exotic citrus), a syrupy body, and a cloyingly-sweet cotton candy bubblegum flavor on the palate. There is almost no hint of oak at all, let alone new oak, and basically none of the “baked sugar” notes survive from batch 1. It was widely hated by the tasting participants. I heard through the grapevine that Cut Spike’s master distiller wanted to change the recipe after batch 1, which explains why it is different. I would not buy a bottle of Batch 2, and my admiration for the distillery has been damaged. I would only buy a bottle of future batches if I had an opportunity to taste them first. “Fool me once…”']"
133,Cutty Sark (12 year) Blended Scotch ,"[': Weirdly barnyard-y (soiled hay) right out of the bottle. This reminds me, immediately, of ', ': Medium bodied, almost syrupy. Very sweet, with cloying taffy, bright red maraschino cherry, and assorted bakery sweets. Not much dimension, but boy does this deliver on the sugar.', ': Short. A welcome hint of something nutty – hazelnut? – and a wash of bitterness. Slightly mouth-drying.', ': A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma (a good thing?) and require yet another rest to reveal some toffee and butterscotch. The palate is (even) sweeter, as in pure white sugar and simple syrup. Skip water here.', ': Ok, it’s not awful, but the additional 9 years (I kid) of aging has not made this into something special. It might have added some oaky sweetness, and a little hazelnut to the palate, and it might also have rounded off some rough edges, but it remains mass-produced blended scotch.']"
134,Cutty Sark Blended Scotch ,"[': Getting past the waft of nail polish remover, there is some nice vanilla, peach pit, and lemon sorbet. There’s also an odd, compost-y scent, like molding fruit. Eugh.', ': Medium-bodied. Relatively low tongue burn. Middling notes of toffee and apricot jam, and a nice milk chocolate chaser. Really, not too bad.', ': Short finish. Milk chocolate again, and mild nuts. The nuts turn somewhat bitter as they fade.', ': A healthy splash of water does nothing to help the nose. The palate is sweetened, and the finish becomes, if anything, more bitter. Stick with ice or mixers, since water is no improvement.', ': Well, aside from that obnoxious rotting vegetation odor, it’s not that bad. The milk chocolate notes are impressive, and while the blend isn’t complex, it’s not offensive to the palate. Just don’t… er… smell it. At any rate, if you’re digging this deep to find affordable whisky, you may as well be putting it on ice or mixing it. It’s hard to imagine sitting back in an overstuffed chair with a snifter of this and actually enjoying it. ']"
135,Cutty Sark Prohibition Edition Blended Scotch ,"[': Smells like Cutty. Wet cardboard, mild oaky sugars, slightly earthy. Good nose tickle, not too hot for 50% ABV. A rest in the glass does nothing to improve the reticent aroma.', ': Thin body. Very sweet upfront, with dense toffee, soft caramel, and vanilla saltwater taffy. A moderate tongue burn, not as hot as 50% would imply. Not much evolution on the tongue, although some of the sugar notes evolve into woody/oaky ones, which gives a nice balance and prevents it from becoming cloying.', ': Medium length. Warming, with a reprise of the caramelized sugar notes from the palate. After these fade, there is a suggestion of mint, and very little charcoal and almost no bitterness.', ': A few drops of water don’t help the aroma… if anything, it’s even more inert now. The water thins the body, and muddies the sweet notes. Water is optional here. I would skip it.', ': Aside from the lackluster aroma, this is shockingly good for an inexpensive blended scotch. The density of sweet flavors on the palate remind me of ']"
136,Dad’s Hat Rye ,"[': Rye! Grassy and explosive, with a healthy dollop of tropical fruit (I can’t tell… pineapple? Coconut?), a woodsy pine/eucalyptus note which seems to be the hallmark of young rye, and a dry herbal kick of something like anise or fennel.', ': Medium-heavy body, slightly chewy. A heavy dose of spice cabinet, primarily cinnamon and clove, which come across as fresh, not dusty. Slightly bitter vegetal notes pervade the midpalate, like green peppercorn and mown grass. At first this appears original and inventive, but then quickly betrays the youth of the spirit.', ': Medium in length. The pine notes return, as does the grass. A ghostly note of caraway comes and goes, and the whole fades with cinnamon, now stale.', ': Several drops of water amp up the grassy notes, alas, covering up some of the fruit. The palate becomes sweeter – cinnamon rolls – and brings out menthol on the finish. Try both with and without water.', ': A rough-and-ready craft rye with a perfectly-chosen ABV, an eclectic but coherent array of rye aromas and flavors, and a few surprises. The grassy youth of the rye comes through like light through a tattered window curtain, sometimes marring the experience. Man would this be good with a few more years on it.']"
137,Dailuaine (16 year) Flora and Fauna ,"[': Light sherry notes of the stonefruit variety: plum, apricot, etc. A very slight rancio note (less rancid and more yeasty) that merges nicely with pale buttery oak. Elegant, though unsurprising.', ': Medium bodied. A little hot for 43%, but resolves quickly into bakery treats (peach tarts?), buttered scones, jam, and caramelized sugar that is almost cola-like.', ': Of medium length. Classic. Red fruits, marzipan and/or almond butter, and the slightest charcoal bitterness. Fades a little herby, like absinthe without the anise.', ': A few drops of water add a bit more of that yeast note, but wash out the rest. Don’t bother with water here, 43% is low enough as it is.', ': Exactly in the middle of your expectations for a medium-sherry Highlander at 16 years of age. It would be uncalled-for to call it boring, but the word entered my mind more than once while tasting. Really though, it’s not boring… it’s just a confidently well-made middle-of-the-road dram that just about anybody should be able to enjoy. If I had to compare it, I’d say it was a bit like ']"
138,Dalwhinnie (15 year) ,"[': White peach, blanched almonds, honeycomb and heavy florals – honeysuckle and … I don’t know … “flower shop”. Very pleasant, very focused. A rest in the glass drops some of the tart fruits and yields some white chocolate.', ': Medium-full body. Clean cereals (puffed malted barley) with a touch of peat (really more of an earthiness than smoke or real peat). In the background, a reprise of the aroma’s fruit-and-flowers routine, but overshadowed by the directness of the barley.', ': Short. Marzipan, a slight oaky bitterness, and faintly fruity. Fades with mouth-drying tannins.', ': A few drops of water increase the amount of fruit on the nose – mostly peach – and actually amplify the slight peatiness on the palate. Try this one both without and then with water.', ': A straightforward but very well-executed malt. This is a quintessential ex-bourbon Highland malt, with primary characteristics of summer fruits, flowers, and honey. It’s very similar to (and cheaper than) ']"
139,David Nicholson 1843 Bourbon ,"[': Soft, reserved nose. May need a rest in the glass to open up. Corn-forward with some dry, dusty whole wheat bread. A stale spice of some kind — cardamom perhaps. Very shy for 100 proof. I was wrong – even a rest does not add interest to the aroma.', ': Medium-bodied. Sweet wheat, cakey and accompanied by cherry coulis. Pleasant, and not overly hot.', ': Short. A brief impression of mint, a reprise of tart cherry, and vanilla cake fading to faint oaky dryness. Not bitter.', ': Even a liberal splash of water does nothing for the nose, except add a weird rancid peanut-butter note. Water is not helpful with this one.', ': A reserved, uninteresting nose belies a very tasty if simple experience on the tongue. Hallmarks of the wheated style (softness, vanilla-sweetness) offer no surprises, but are markedly well-implemented for such a low price point. I think you’re basically getting a discount on a perfectly serviceable wheated bourbon because of the bland aroma.']"
140,David Nicholson Reserve 100 Proof Bourbon ,"[': Powerfully rye-heavy: lots of cherry-infused clove, cinnamon stick, and mulled wine. Somewhat sharp and spirity at 50% ABV. Medium-sweet, with some light caramelized sugars and an oaky undertone.', ': Thin body. Tannic and tart, with a middling tongue burn. Some sweet kettle corn notes emerge after the burn subsides, and a reprise of the spices promised by the nose. Cinnamon red-hots, a thin glaze of vanilla frosting.', ': Of medium length. A little bit of everything – some sweetness and vanilla, some dry oak, some dusty cinnamon. Fades without changing much, and no bitterness.', ': Water doesn’t seem to change the aroma much, but adds a welcome nuttiness to the palate and especially the finish. Water is advisable here, and also helps to tame the high ABV.', ': The rye certainly packs a punch here, with a full complement of spices, but it fails to elevate the corn/sweet bourbon out of the $20 rut. At $33, that actually makes this overpriced in my view. The proof is right, and it’s perfectly passable in cocktails, but it won’t shift ']"
141,Deanston (12 year) ,"[': Floral, with notes of rosewater and orange blossom. Delicate aromas of peach, white tea, filtered honey, fresh spring water, and a slight nose tickle (alcohol).', ': Medium body. Initial tongue burn leaves primarily hay and toasted malt. Some woody character, like bark, but none of the delicate flowers or fruits promised by the aroma. Fairly earthy, with some of those hay/bark notes verging on peat.', ': Short. A continuance of the palate, with more bark and hay. As it fades, it reveals faint banana and coconut.', ': Several drops of water seem to wash out the delicate aroma, leaving a hint of fresh laundry and ozone. The palate becomes somewhat sweeter, with a vanilla note. The finish becomes a bit brighter, with a reprise of the peach notes. I’d avoid water with this because of what it does to the aroma.', ': Well, I had high hopes, but this is another Deanston dud for me. The nose promises so much, with its airy insinuation of peach and honey and orange blossom flavors to come. Instead, you get a mouthful of hay and some muddy puddles of peat water. I exaggerate, but the flavor is definitely a let-down, and it’s not redeemed by the vague finish. If I had to drain a bottle of this, I could manage it, but I wouldn’t fork over actual cash for a bottle, even at $50 (didn’t you hear? $50 is the new $30 in whisky). Actually, you might be better off pouring a Glencairn of this and giving it a solid whiff every few minutes. Just pour it down the drain when you’re done. You get the nice aroma, and no hangover or calories! Think of it as whisky aromatherapy. You’re welcome.']"
142,Deanston Virgin Oak ,"[': An unappetizing chemical component, like partially-cured leather. Beeswax without the honey. Dry, dusty stale malt. Wet cardboard.', ': Nicely creamy body. Minimal tongue burn. A hint of honey, hardwood sawdust, and something saline, like salted ice cream.', ': Short. A lot of oaky bitterness, and a return of the wet cardboard. Slight nougat, and a tang of raw honey.', ': A small splash of water yielded a musty, fungal odor and upped all the negative notes. It also thinned the body somewhat, and added some hazelnut to the palate and finish, and made the finish somewhat sweeter. Not pleasant, either way.', ': Wow I really don’t like this. A shame, because I’ve read that recent changes at Deanston had upped its single-malt game. The craft presentation (non-chill-filtering and 46%+ ABV) is a huge plus, but it’s a pity that this NAS release fell horribly flat. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, too, and went through several glasses over several weeks before resigning myself to writing this review. It’s just not good, even at this bargain-basement price. It tastes like the “virgin oak” used to finish the whisky was from a tainted or improperly cured barrel. A pity, but I hold out hope that the age-statement releases are much better.']"
143,Dewar’s (12 year) Special Reserve Blended Scotch ,"[': Lemon curd on buttered scones. A bit of paint-thinner – a lot more nose tickle than I like to see in a 43% ABV. A clear quantity of grain whisky – light vanilla, unripe fruit, and fresh hay. Definitely on the “light and airy” side, but with an unpleasant amount of burn.', ': Light cream – not very heavy-bodied despite all the grain. Potent, and the 43% ABV comes through nicely with just the right amount of tongue burn. Hazelnut skins, brown sugar cookies, and lemon peel.', ': Short, but not unpleasantly bitter. Some lingering pastry notes and a hint of bitter lemon. A suggestion of wood. Final note is just bitterness – oh well.', ': A splash of water releases a hint of anise and tames the nose tickle somewhat. It also improves the sweetness of the dram, and rounds out some of the off flavors. It doesn’t do a whole lot for the finish, and the bitterness remains. Nevertheless, this is a whisky that benefits greatly from the addition of water.', ': On the upside, it’s only slightly more expensive than the White Label, so if you’re getting an inexpensive blend anyway, it’s worth the upgrade. It has all the hallmarks of the “mid-range” blend: light in style, heavily “watered-down” with cheap grain whisky, and that telltale bitter finish. Sure, the malt component is 12 years old, and I’m sure it’s lovely, but it’s marred by 12 year-old grain whisky, which needs another 6 or so to mellow out. Yes, it’s better than White Label, but it doesn’t stand up to even the cheapest single malts. I’d take Glenlivet 12 over this any day. Another blend bites the dust.']"
144,Dewar’s White Label Blended Scotch ,[]
145,District Made Bourbon ,"[': Pleasant corn. Moderately sweet with cherry notes. Both nutty and oaky (just enough). Excellent balance. Bit of a nose tickle.', ': Syrupy body. Sweet again, with moderate to heavy tongue burn. Nutty and oaky again. Turns a bit dry, which provides a nice contrast with the prior sweetness.', ': Medium long. Bitter charcoal up front, the finish is much drier. Some dark cocoa and espresso.', ': Water turns down the sweetness a notch and adds cocoa to the aroma. Less tongue burn, but no additional notes on the palate. Water optional.', ': Excellent for a 2 year-old bourbon from a new distillery. Great balance, especially on the aroma. Sufficient complexity on the palate to elevate it above “entry level” craft bourbon. A surprise.']"
146,Eagle Rare (10 year) Bourbon ,"[': Sweet and a little tart – orange peel and unripe cherries. Soft sweet corn, and a layer of caramel. Little or no spice.', ': Silky smooth body, with the tart cherries up front, a bit of a burn, and then creamed corn, malted cereal, orange marmalade, and a hint of oak.', ': Medium length, with just a ghost of the palate flavors. A little caramel, a little orange peel, then gone.', ': Water seems to neither improve nor harm the whisky.', ': A very nicely balanced nose, with both tart and sweet notes in harmony. I could wish for some hint of rye spice and a more robust finish. Still, I already prefer this to the similar and similarly-priced ']"
147,Edradour (10 year) ,"[': Sherry, for sure. Rancio notes, like funky dried fruit. A fungal woodiness pervades – like decaying trees and wet fallen leaves. This smells surprisingly old for a young 10. Beneath, a bit of caramel apple.', ': Nice, mouth-coating sweet fruity candy, raisins, caramel apple, and a little more of that borderline-rancid oxidized wine flavor.', ': Relatively long. A hint of smoke, dried cherries, and a nice, lingering woodiness that never grows bitter.', ': Water seems to dampen the nose. On the palate, it wakes some fresher fruit, but at the expense of an increased alcohol burn. I would avoid the water, especially with the low bottling proof.', ': I was surprised at both the apparent age and the quality of this sample. It is in no way inferior to the ']"

149,Elijah Craig (12 year) Bourbon ,"[': Sumptuous caramel, cinnamon-sugar apples, heavy oak, maraschino cherries (the bright red kind), serious brown sugar and molasses.', ': Thin body, only slightly hot considering the high ABV. Big, tannin-y oak up front, and not particularly sweet.', ': On the short side. Hazelnuts. Furniture lacquer. Cinnamon and a hint of star anise.', ': A few drops of water bring vanilla and more sweetness to the nose. The palate becomes a bit more balanced, and the water causes some of the brown-sugar notes to carry on through to the finish. When drinking this neat, the water may be a good idea.', ': Elijah Craig starts off promising on the nose, with lots of sugar, oak, and great depth. However, it fails to deliver on that promise when it hits the palate, where it’s thin and oaky and simple. The higher-than-normal ABV gives it an edge in cocktails, where its flavors can come across, but I wouldn’t choose this for my house bourbon. That said, if a bottle landed in my lap I would make good use of it in a whole mess of Old Fashioneds.']"
150,Elijah Craig (12 year) Small Batch Barrel Proof Bourbon ,"[': Fresh-hewn lumber. Dry and sappy. Seriously, this smells like the inside of a lumber mill. While there is an oak weight to the wood aromas, there is also a piney aspect. Despite the high proof, the nose tickle is manageable. A noticeable lack of sweet notes.', ': Thick bodied. Liquid wood. Dense and astringent. The tongue burn is searing, but brief. Dry (still no sugar) but concentrated and heady. My wounded tongue feels like it’s hallucinating cinnamon and clove.', ': Long. Now a little sweetness creeps in, in the form of caramelized wood sugar. Not bitter or charcoal-heavy at all. Pungent, cheek-drying oak tannins. A fading hint of powdery cinnamon.', ': A dash of water mutes the aroma but adds some caramel both to the nose and palate. A little cherry creeps in, and the overall impression is far more balanced. Don’t expect a little water to save your tongue though, this stuff is still 131 proof. Water highly recommended here.', ': This is 12 year-old dry bourbon at its most elemental. Expect little sweetness and a metric ton of wood, but you won’t be able to fault this for pungent bourbon flavor. I highly recommend dosing it with a little water, tasting, and then dosing it with quite a lot more. Reminds me of ']"
151,Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': A little shy. The first impression is of an indeterminate nuttiness. Some sweet vanilla, banana cream, and a hint of coconut underscore the reticent oak. Round and soft, but without much presence. As usual, a rest in the glass reveals more vanilla and more refined sugar (as in vanilla cake frosting).', ': Thin body. Very soft, with a mild tongue burn. Again, there isn’t much to describe beyond nondescript nut butter, tannic oak, and cake frosting. A bitter note suggests but does not assert spices such as clove and cinnamon.', ': More sweetness here, with black licorice, nonpareils, drying tannins, and very little to no bitterness. Fades inoffensively, self-effacing.', ': A few drops of water yield a vegetal (grassy) note, and increases the nose tickle. The palate is slightly more alert, but does not add anything substantial. Water optional.', ': The word “shy” describes just about every facet of the experience of drinking this whiskey. It nearly glides along the palate without interacting much with the taste buds (hence the “soft” descriptor), and while it has a nice round, balanced interplay of tropical fruit, wood, and alcohol, the whole is dialed down to “low”. Oddly, it doesn’t taste particularly watery or watered-down, but rather that the alcohol carries little with it in the way of flavor compounds. This might be a good whiskey to balance subtle ingredients in a contemplative cocktail, where you don’t want the bourbon to overwhelm something else. At $25, that’s not bad, but it feels like this is crafted for an audience that doesn’t really want to taste their bourbon. A more likely explanation is this is what happens when you take a “value” bourbon and compromise on the barrel ages of the components. Drop 4 years and you lose a lot of oaky sugars in the aroma, roundness on the palate, and spices in the finish. That tell-tale grassy note that showed when water was added is also a consequence of the younger juice. At the lower price-point this is still a “Try Before Buy”, but I’ve tried it and I won’t be buying more.']"
152,Ellington Reserve (8 year) Canadian Whisky ,"[': A blast of young grain, a wave of artificial vanilla, and something vegetal, like fresh-cut cabbage. There is also a cloying sweetness attached to the vanilla.', ': Eughh. Chemical solvent, and a very fake taste, like concentrated food dye. The melted-ice-cream vanilla flavor tastes like it was added in by the bag. I don’t want to swallow it, but onward, in the name of Science!', ': Extremely (mercifully?) short, although it leaves behind a coating in your mouth like someone’s been spraying RoundUp weed killer nearby and you got some in your mouth. Truly wretched.', ': Didn’t even try.', ': Please, please don’t buy this. If one person, somewhere, reads this review in a BevMo and puts the bottle back on the shelf, then I have done my duty as a whisky blogger, and I can die contented. Buy anything – literally anything – instead. You’re better off with vodka “aged” overnight in a coffee cup.']"

154,Evan Williams Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon ,"[': Sweet and soft, with initial notes of sweet corn, cherry syrup, and marshmallow. Mild nutty oak. Simple, straightforward, and pleasant. A rest in the glass adds a tutti-frutti or fruit punch note.', ': Thin body. Cherry throat lozenge and caramel frosting greet the tongue, followed by a moderate tongue burn that also introduces cinnamon, clove, and brown sugar. Once again, simple but effective with no off-notes.', ': Medium-long. Warming. Palate flavors continue, plus mild mouth-drying tannins (like nut skins), vanilla cake frosting, and the mildest of oak notes. Fades without evolving, but also without turning bitter. As with the aroma, a rest in the glass adds a fruit punch note.', ': Several drops of water initially mute the aroma, which struggles to wake back up even after a rest. The palate and finish seem oddly muddled, and the tongue burn is actually a little more piercing. Skip the water, here, if you’re drinking it neat.', ': Quintessential bourbon, with a potent flavor that is appropriate for 100 proof whiskey, but with a surprisingly mild tongue burn despite that proof. The flavors are all exactly what you expect from a rye-flavored bourbon, but you also don’t get any off-flavors or evidence of immature whiskey. For the price, this may be one of the best bourbons under $20, and is a slam dunk choice for home bourbon-based cocktails.']"

156,Exclusive Malts: Bowmore (12 year) 2001-2014 ,"[': Leather, orange furniture polish, and a muddy, marshy peat meet the nose first. Clearly this is sherried, but the sherry effect is that of a much older cask – concentrated, meaty, resiny, and with a fat helping of rancio (past balsamic and verging on rotting fruit). The peat is actually out-performed by the rancidity of the sherry. I’m not certain I would be able to tell this was peated in a blind tasting.', ': Big and fiery, at first, then fruit-forward, with figs, raisins, and prunes. A milder level of rancid notes, thankfully, serving instead to underscore the “old” flavor of the sherry and making the whole dram seem older. The peat still does not assert itself.', ': Much more leather, supple and accentuated by fading fruit notes. Peat peeks in at the end, but is still overshadowed by the remnants of rancio. Not bitter.', ': A few drops of water lessen the intensity of the nose, but don’t yield any new notes. The tongue burn is tamed, and a bit more orange oil appears on the tongue. Try both with and without water. Diluting it to 46% makes it eminently more drinkable, but the intensity of the sherry is lost, and the overall effect is forgettable.', ': Who knew this was going to be a sherry-bomb? Sherry notes that I’d associate with a 20+ year-old sherried malt, meaty and resinous. The peat is nowhere to be found, or so outperformed by the sherry that it instead melds into the background. I would recommend this to sherry buffs, especially those who enjoy the meaty/rancio side of the sherry spectrum. Alas, the price on this is a little optimistic. I’d happily pay $50 for a 12 year-old Bowmore with these characteristics, but not $80 and especially not more than $100. Still, if you’ve got money to burn and enjoy both rancio sherry and Bowmore, you’ll enjoy this one for sure. For everyone else, this is a “Try before you buy”.']"
157,Exclusive Malts: Laphroaig (8 year) 2005-2013 ,"[': Slightly more vanilla than the OB. Also, a bit more cereal sweetness. Not quite as much meatiness. Otherwise, notes are the same – intense Laphroaig peat and seaweed.', ': Far sweeter on the tongue than the OB. Vanilla in spades, and the usual complement of peat and salt notes, although not as complete as the OB is. This seems to be missing all of the charred meat notes.', ': Long, of course. Same notes (echoes of the peat and smoke aromas), but with a suggestion of sandalwood.', ': Water here does only what you’d expect it to – tames the burn, amps up the vanilla, and makes the finish sweeter. With this one, I would use water only to dilute the dram to a drinkable strength.', ': I struggle to find something unique here. It tastes like the OB cask strength, but with a few drops of vanilla extract added and with the complex smoky meaty flavor reduced. It could be thought of as a component of Laphroaig, and thus available as an analysis of one aspect of the OB, but its only claim to individuality – the increased vanilla – is little reason for me to own a bottle. Between the cheaper OB cask strength and this, I’ll opt for the OB.']"
158,Exclusive Malts: Linkwood (14 year) 1999-2014 ,"[': Hay. A ghost of peat. Barnyard, with the heady mustiness that comes with older-style malt. Light and wispy.', ': Lemon-lime and a burst of sour sweetness, followed by a very intense 110-proof tongue burn. After the tears clear from my eyes, I can taste smoldering hay, heathery peat (no sense of the ocean), and straightforward malt (breakfast cereal, bakery goods, etc.). Take small sips of this.', ': Long. The smoke comes to the fore, with tons of charcoal briquette, campfire, and the ever-present hay. Fades without bitterness – nice!', ': A few drops of water bring a meaty/salty bacon-like element to the nose, and tames the fire on the tongue. I highly recommend water with this dram.', ': I did not expect this level of peat from Linkwood. While it teases on the nose, it makes itself felt once it hits the tongue. A nice example of the hay-and-heather style of Highland peated malt, which is representative of the style of Highland malt made before the advent of maltings with non-peat heat sources.']"
159,Exclusive Malts: Longmorn (20 year) 1992 – 2012 ,"[': Sticky sherry notes of strawberry jam, apple cider vinegar, fig preserves, underlayed with oaky sap (not quite maple syrup). Powerful, and delectable. The fruit is profound, but not cloying. The oak is beautifully balanced, and while the whole smells integrated and mature, there aren’t excess rancid notes. Very fresh for 20 years old!', ': A powerhouse of fruit, with equal helpings of jammed, dried, and fresh. The oak is present, but not overwhelming, and the tongue burn is surprisingly minimal for something over 50% ABV. It doesn’t fully represent its age, without much balsamic-type flavors, but it is round and complete. Eyes closed, I would say it was 16 years old.', ': Jolly rancher candies, a touch of cinnamon, a lot of fruitcake, and some more of that maple syrup (but not quite) on the fade-out. Becomes slightly bitter, with nut skins and burned caramel on the tail.', ': A dash of water really opens up the fresh fruit – there are even some cherry blossom or apple blossom notes added. On the tongue, the burn is even more muted, and some chocolate notes are displayed. The malt alone is an experience, water brings it to another level.', ': Wow. What a birthday present to me! I have a weak spot for fruit-bomb sherried numbers, and this ticks all of the boxes (except one). The nose is phenomenal, especially with some water to open it up, and on the tongue it purrs with sherry goodness and no undue burn. Alas, the finish has more bitterness than I like. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic whisky, and a real solid reason to seek out some more Longmorn, especially if it’s sherried.']"
160,Exclusive Malts: North Highland (17 year) 1996-2014 ,"[': A sour tang, like fino sherry but fruitier – unripe figs? Stewed peaches, pits and all. Vanilla ice cream, which does remind me of Glenmorangie. After a rest in the glass, I can detect something like peach cobbler and buttery shortbread cookies, but that sharp “fino” note pervades all.', ': Hot, of course. Thin bodied. The sherry creeps in as a layer of fig and lemon, still on the sour side. There is a nice body of malt, with characteristic Glenmorangie shortbread and vanilla.', ': Medium-long and warming. Devoid of bitterness. The fruits become more subdued, and are suggestive of fruit pies and jams. Roasted chestnuts fade to the end.', ': A sizable splash of water brings out an astoundingly clear note of bubblegum. The nose takes on a waxy aspect, and the sour notes are reduced. The palate, which is far milder, retains the bubblegum and becomes a little blander. The finish acquires a slight menthol note. Definitely try this neat, then add a few drops of water, and then dilute it to around 50% for the full experience.', ': The “sharp” sour note on the nose definitely feels unbalanced. This is possibly an experimental cask that didn’t make it into one of the Glenmorangie special editions and was sold on the independent market. It reminds me somewhat of ']"
161,Exclusive Malts: The Dalmore (13 year) 2000 – 2013 ,"[': Peat, but integrated well with vanilla and saltwater taffy. Hot-smoked salmon, bitter herbs, white pepper. Lavender.', ': Somewhat thin body. Barbeque coal smoke, fresh-cracked pepper, blackened salmon. Very low tongue-burn for something at 53.5% ABV.', ': Long. Herbal and smoky, lavender especially. Mildly bitter, but ends on a sweet vanilla note.', ': A few drops of water mute the nose, or supplant the usual aromas with alcohol fumes. The palate might be softer, and carries more tart notes – white vinegar? I would avoid the water here, unless you feel you need to dilute it to bottle-strength (I don’t think it needs dilution).', ': There’s a lot going on in this one. It seems that Dalmore’s house characteristics are solely derived from its sherry aging, because I would not be able to identify this as Dalmore if it weren’t for the label. It does have a Highland drift to the peat; instead of piquant smoke and overt seaweed, the peat is herbal and reminds me of cooking aromas. A truly unusual take on both Dalmore malt AND Highland peated whisky. Well done.']"

Sweeter than I expected, although the menthol and eucalyptus notes continue to the palate, so now it tastes exactly like a menthol cough drop, the kind with sweet cough syrup in the center.', ': Medium-long. I’ll let you take a guess. Ding ding! Menthol. Antiseptic, grassy, and I swear it’s actually clearing out my sinuses. Fades eventually, although you still feel like you just chewed a eucalyptus cud.', ': A few drops of water release… oh dear God, more menthol. Make it stop.', ': Seriously, they could probably market this stuff as barrel-aged ']"
163,FEW Rye ,"[': Overwhelming notes of banana custard, verging on rotting banana. Even after a rest in the glass, I get nothing except nose-numbing waves of banana. At last, I can tease out a note of dusted cinnamon. But really, this smells exactly like ', ': A few oaky notes up front, some birch beer and maple syrup. Then, it’s back to the All-Banana All-Day Show, with Bananas Foster, caramelized banana, etc.', ': Short. What do you think? Bananas. Damn bananas. There’s also some hazelnut butter and dusty stale cinnamon.', ': Water has no appreciable effect on this, that I can tell. Feel free to skip it.', ': This is the weirdest rye I’ve ever tasted. It’s very soft and has no bitter or off flavors, but all of the flavors it does have are smothered in puréed banana. If I were tasting blind, there’s no way I’d be able to tell you that this was rye. In fact, I’m not certain I’d be able to tell you it was whiskey. If you do like banana flavors in whiskey, you will LOVE this, and I’d bet it would make a fascinating banana manhattan or banana old fashioned. If I liked banana.']"
164,Filibuster “Dual Cask” Bourbon ,"[': A little shyer than the rye, with a distinct pine resin note that likely derives from the rye grain component in the mash. A rest in the glass intensifies the pine a bit, and reveals only a shimmer of jammy fruit. Overall impression is dry and dusty.', ': Syrupy body. Moderate tongue burn. There are flecks of maple syrup and a rash of oaky sweetness that rids it of dryness, but there’s not a lot of complexity otherwise. Faint woodsmoke and fainter dusty rye spices.', ': Medium-short. Back to being dry, with echoes of spice (now I get some of that clove and cinnamon I was expecting) and some barrel tannin. Not too bitter, but not particularly complex. There are some nutty notes (hazelnut or walnut) on the fade-out.', ': A few drops of water coax out peanut butter, vanilla and more maple, and smother the pine resin notes. This gives the aroma better balance and some kind of identity. The palate retains its sweetness, and the finish seems a little more alive. Water is highly recommended with this one.', ': A shy bourbon, with hints of interesting flavors and aromas that never quite announce themselves, although a splash of water helps. The bourbon starts dry, becomes lightly sweet across the tongue, and then flees. The wine finish is so much in the background that it almost disappears. This is far less successful than ']"
165,Filibuster “Dual Cask” Rye ,"[': Soft, round spicy rye with a big heaping of grape jam. Bright, fruity, and with scattered elements of apple cider, berry preserves, and an undercurrent of cracked black pepper, cloves, and caraway. This has moderate depth, but very well-balanced fruits and spice. A rest in the glass brings additional sweetness, like sugar glaze on a cinnamon roll.', ': Medium bodied. Rye spices jump to the fore, with the aforementioned clove plus powdered cinnamon, dried apples, and gingerbread. A mild tongue burn barely interrupts the almost Christmas-y flavors.', ': Medium length. A reprise of the same flavors, plus a little bit of bitterness and a dusting of charcoal which adds a little smokiness. Finishes without evolving much.', ': A few drops of water open up a bit more alcohol (“nose tickle”) and a tart high note, like kiwi or green grapes. The water also amps the tongue burn and thins the body. The water is not really required here.', ': Pleasant, but with enough spice to give it an edge. The finish in wine barrels has laden the aroma with layer upon layer of fresh fruits which are balanced nicely by rye spice notes. The whole gets a little muddier on the palate, losing some of the fruit, but the experience remains positive through the end. Probably some extra years (pre-wine cask) would tighten up that midpalate, but $40 is already at the upper end of what the market will bear for young sourced rye, even as well-finished as this, and the West Coast sees distribution of this at the not-ideal price of $55.']"
166,Filibuster Boondoggler Whiskey ,"[': The piney note from the ', ': Thin body. A moderate tongue burn is followed by more fruit punch and bubblegum, as well as corn syrup and oaky furniture polish. Some mouth-drying tannins, and no off-notes, but not particularly complex.', ': Medium length. The pine note returns, and puckering tannins continue to dry the mouth and lips. No bitterness, but also no evolution. Fades with a hint of grape skins.', ': A few drops of water adds some tartness to the already-tart fruit punch notes. The water also adds some processed-sugar (cheap candy) notes to the palate and finish. I don’t suggest adding water to this.', ': This doesn’t really speak to me. The wine barrels do contribute some fruit notes, but they seem confused and not well-integrated. The rye, which was so expressive ']"

168,Forty Creek Barrel Select ,"[': Initially, heavy new-make character (grassy, vegetal, reminds me of white dog) – that dissipates after a rest in the glass, leaving a thick layer of caramel, with buttercream frosting and a thin veneer of tannic oak. Vanilla pervades, while the caramel is verging on burnt caramel, with wisps of char.', ': Thick, sweet, syrupy. Did I mention sweet? Repeated caramel notes, butterscotch candies, dulce de leche, etc. It all tastes heavily sweet, but not in a fake/corn syrup way.', ': Medium-short in length. Initially, vanilla dominates and then gives way to coconut extract and marzipan (almond). No bitterness.', ': A few drops of water release a little cinnamon (now it smells like a Cinna-Bon), and perhaps thins the body a touch.', ': Like many cheaper Canadian whiskies, this is over-the-top sugary sweet. The effect is decadent rather than fake (a major plus), reminding me of a high-end bakery treats rather than cheap mass-produced candy. Aside from the various iterations of sugar, there’s just a little bit of oakiness and not much complexity. A dessert – something that might be good poured over ice cream.']"
169,Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve ,"[': Distinctly Canadian whisky. Sweet – a ton of brown sugar, honey, and molasses accompanied by a twang of medicinal grain alcohol, a cross between middling vodka and rubbing alcohol. After a rest in the glass some of the ‘rubbing alcohol’ has dissipated, revealing sweet baked goods (“', ': Soft, silky body. Very low tongue burn (apropos for 40%), with those same sweet baked goods up-front on the palate. These are accompanied by mild black licorice (anise), corn pudding, butterscotch frosting, mildly bitter oak, and faint dusty charcoal.', ': Medium length. The mild oak becomes mildly tannic – mouth drying – and the bitterness continues but is still balanced by the remaining sweet notes (brown sugar, mostly). Fades without evolving.', ': A few drops of water increase the nose tickle without improving the complexity. The palate feels thinner – indeed watery – although the finish is a little sweeter. Skip the water.', ': I’m not quite sure what all the fuss was about five years ago. This is categorically Canadian whisky, by its soft mouth feel and dominant sweet notes, but it suffers the same downsides that less-expensive Canadian blends suffer: excessive ‘rubbing alcohol’ aromas, flat one-dimensional palate notes, and a vaguely bitter finish. I liked ']"
170,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch Bourbon – 2015 ,"[': Potent! Bright, sweet notes of candied orange peel contrast with deep notes of toasty cereal grains, oatmeal cookies, sticky oak resin, and shellac. Something sweet as well – fresh homemade toffee.', ': Fiery. After setting the surface of my tongue ablaze, it finally resolves into chocolate-covered cherries, graham crackers (or gingerbread?), orange bitters, and butterscotch syrup.', ': Long. After the fire subsides, roasted nuts and silky oak tannins (not a hint of bitterness) coat the mouth. Fades with dried coconut shavings.', ': Several drops of water open up some honeysuckle, orange flower water, and makes the sugary notes more round and full. Not only does the water also make the bourbon more palatable on the tongue (taste-bud fires are now at a minimum), it reveals a wider array of oaky and brown sugar notes, plus a delectable vanilla crème brûlée. Water is a MUST with this.', ': Everything you expect in a well-made bourbon, but with each individual component turned up to 11. At the bottling strength of 54.25%, it’s hard to get a grasp on what’s going on beyond all the alcohol burn, so I highly recommend taming this with a little water to really appreciate the palate and get the most out of the aroma. If you can’t stand the idea of adding water, at least let it open up in the glass for several minutes. This is the kind of bourbon that you pour, sit back, and enjoy slowly over the course of a quiet evening.']"
171,Four Roses Single Barrel Bourbon ,"[': Hot! High rye spices, crushed mint (oh wow I want a julep right now), wood char (which I can’t usually smell), black pepper. There’s a LOT going on in this nose, but the high ABV makes it a challenge to contemplate.', ': Light brown sugar. Already I can taste barrel tannin, slightly acerbic. Hot on the tongue, but carries waves of cinnamon red hots, brown sugar cookies, freshly-grated ginger, and white pepper.', ': Long. A reprise of the spices from the aroma, along with some cherry lozenge. Fades on the cherry note.', ': Water, if possible, makes the nose more spicy, with nuances of nutmeg and allspice. Finishes slightly sweeter. Water definitely helps with the intense burn.', ': A big bourbon with a lot to offer. High rye mashbill, and the resulting “spice cabinet” really permeates the experience. If you like baking spices in your whisky, you will LOVE this. Definitely try it with a slug of water, if only to get it down around 46%.']"
172,Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': Spice. Lots and lots of black pepper. Black licorice. Mulling spices, but mostly black pepper.', ': Full-bodied and corn heavy, with lots of molasses. Suddenly it’s all sweetness and wood. Where are the spices?', ': Caramel Apple! Some milk chocolate. Much better finish than palate. Finally trails off with some cinnamon.', ': BIG Spice comes through on the nose, and the water wakes up some cayenne. Thins the body somewhat, and kills the finish. Try it once with water, but in general this bourbon doesn’t need it.', ': A respectable rye-recipe bourbon with some big, bold flavors. It’s not often that I’m able to identify bourbon notes other than cinnamon and spice (from the rye), corn syrup (from the corn), and charcoal (from the toasted barrels). Here I find black pepper on the nose, and delights like caramel apple and milk chocolate on the finish. The only downside is the relatively one-note palate, which is all corn syrup and barrel char. For that reason, I’d order this at a bar, but I wouldn’t make it my staple home bourbon. Still, for under $40, this stands up well to the competition.']"

175,George Dickel (No. 12) Tennessee Whisky ,"[': Oddly grassy, with notes of fresh-mown grass as well as something like pickle juice or sauerkraut. I’m now so preoccupied with the thought of pickle-flavored whiskey that I can’t detect anything else. Luckily the pickle note dissipates with a rest in the glass, leaving plain old green grass behind.', ': Soft, medium-bodied… almost heavy. A strong tongue burn is followed by an assortment of hard candies, cinnamon red hots, hay bales, lemon peel, and floor wax.', ': Finally some oak, with mild drying tannins and very little bitterness. Not particularly sweet, and a bit one-dimensional. Fades without evolving.', ': Several drops of water seem to have no effect on the aroma or palate, although it might make the finish a little sweeter. Water is optional here.', ': Uhh. Well, it’s probably better than ']"
176,George Dickel Bottled In Bond Tennessee Whiskey ,"[': Sweet, fruity, floral, and flecked with oak. We’re off to a good start. The fruit is plentiful: mixed berry jam, kiwi, rhubarb, red delicious apple, and fresh plums. There is also a popped corn aroma, some light caramel, and the smell that you get when you open a fresh bag of hardwood lump charcoal. This is delivered along with a strong nose tickle, so don’t stick your nose too deep in the glass.', ': Thin body. The fruit – especially the jam – continues onto the palate. After a brief but intense tongue burn – it is 100 proof after all – there is soft corn, sweet honeyed cornbread, mild oaky tannins, and more. Quite complex.', ': Long. The fruit – now with some balsamic-like density – continues through the finish, and evolves into licorice drops, red pepper jelly, charcoal without bitterness, and vague wafting smoke, like a newly-lit campfire. This lasts for surprisingly long (for a corn whiskey). Excellent.', ': A few drops of water add candy corn and vanilla ice cream to the aroma and palate without taking anything away. The burn seems less intense, but the finish is slightly more vegetal (grassy). Try both without and then with water.', ': Wow. This stuff is legit. 13 years of aging, prominent fruit notes without undue bitterness that last from nose to finish, all for $35? This has just become my new favorite under-$50 bourbon. As long as it retains its age statement, it will sit alongside ']"
177,George Dickel Rye ,"[': A little hot, and very spicy. Clove and cardamom pop first, and then a bed of cinnamon, oaky vanilla, pine sap, and apple cider vinegar. A rest in the glass turns the vinegar into fresh apple cider.', ': Medium-bodied. Again, somewhat hot, with a cinnamon-flecked burn that slowly mellows into marshmallow, wood polish, orange peel, cherry syrup, and apple compote.', ': Medium-long. Tart, with a swath of lemon juice and cherry, which gives way to slightly bitter charcoal that my label-influenced mind is telling me tastes like maple. Fades without further evolution.', ': Several drops of water bring out a grassy note, and a bunch of anise (licorice) on both the aroma and the flavor. It doesn’t seem to affect the tongue burn. I don’t think this benefits from water, but it won’t hurt it either.', ': There’s nothing particularly unusual about the notes in this rye, but what’s exceptional is that the notes that count are the ones that pop most. The fresh fruit, the tartness, and the not-at-all-stale spices are always in the forefront. A good rest in the glass makes this rye smell exactly like mulled apple cider. Very, very nice for a bottom-shelfer. This compares favorably with my rye standards, ']"
178,Glen Garioch Founder’s Reserve ,"[': Elegant and nuanced. While the aroma is of a classically American oak-matured malt without any of the trappings of cask finishing, there is a lot of depth here. Vanilla in fine balance with lemon peel and a faint fruitiness, like white raspberries. The required butterscotch/caramel notes are present, and not at all cloying. The alcohol nose tickle comes across as tart, rather than chemical. Very nice.', ': Medium-bodied, with a initial hefty rush of tongue burn. The 48% ABV really packs a punch without much sugary sweetness to pad it. Some drying oak tannins, and a pervasive nuttiness.', ': Medium length, with some of that vanilla returning in the form of crispy wafer cookies, and the citrus peel in the form of lemon curd. The finish flirts with the edge of bitterness, but resolves instead as lightly wooded and slightly drying.', ': Several drops of water add an herbal note to the nose – white tea? The water does nothing to tame the torrent of alcohol on the palate, perhaps even increasing its burn. This doesn’t really need water for flavor enhancement, but you might want to consider adding more than a few drops if you want to reduce the burn via dilution.', ': I generally grow bored with malts aged only in ex-bourbon. However, while the Founder’s Reserve doesn’t stray far from the mark in terms of character, it has a grace and nuance that keep it interesting, and a powerful right hook in that 48% ABV – it wakes you right up. This is priced right, at $44. A good baseline dram with a little something extra – a rarity these days.']"
179,Glen Scotia (15 year) ,"[': Slightly meaty, with a dose of beeswax, fungal earth, and very faint peat (not smoke). Some sulfur, but not to the “rotten eggs” degree. There is a note of lemon peel, but it is in the background. Not sweet.', ': Thin body. Beeswax again. After a mild tongue burn, it becomes nutty (nougat and/or marzipan) and a little bitter (walnut skins). Like the aroma, there is a distinct lack of sweetness.', ': Medium-short. Dry, a little woody. More charcoal, and bitter at that, than I like. Fades with only a hint of sweetness, in the form of caramel.', ': The addition of a few drops of water brings a little sweetness in the form of ripe banana and vanilla cake frosting. Water is a pleasant addition with this dram.', ': This is not something I would choose over any comparably-priced malt. It is too dry without having complexity to justify the lack of sweetness. There is nothing floral about it, and precious little fruit. The 15 years in oak have lent a bit of mature woodiness, but also appear to have added a bit too much bitterness and charcoal. The earthy mild peat on the nose is interesting, but doesn’t warrant the purchase of a bottle, especially not if you can get a good price on ']"
180,Glen Scotia Campbeltown Malts Festival 2019 ,"[': Clean, crisp peat, like freshly-dug loam and green-wood campfire smoke. The peat is in roughly equal proportion to a distinct rum aroma – molasses, burnt caramel, and toasted walnuts. There’s also banana-nut bread (luckily, the banana element is faint and not overly ripe like a lot of banana notes in whisky), light tobacco, and meaty dried coconut. The peat is not strong – indeed after nosing for a few minutes it fades into the background, which gives an overall impression of “smoked rum” rather than “rum-flavored peat”. After a rest in the glass, Glen Scotia’s signature lemon peel note becomes more detectable.', ': Soft, silky body. Moderate tongue burn which subsides quickly. Palate has a dose of licorice, coconut-flecked rum, earthy peat, and a woody overtone. A sense of baked goods pervades – like chewy brown sugar bars or rum-raisin pudding. Very tasty.', ': Long. Meaty, with tons of cashew, nougat, date, and more. Fades slowly with a slight edge of woody bitterness and a suggestion of charcoal.', ': A few drops of water kick up a slight vegetal note – like rhum agricole – but otherwise doesn’t seem to change the aroma. The palate is thinner and the burn reduced. I would say only add water if you’d like to lower the proof.', ': I’ve had both excellent rum-finished single malts as well as atrocious ones. The bad ones invariably taste like the worst parts of rum: overripe bananas and bitter astringency. The excellent ones translate the ']"
181,Glen Scotia Double Cask ,"[': Tropical fruits up the wazoo. (What the heck is a wazoo? ', ': Medium body, not quite syrupy. Oaky up front, with lots of vanilla and a hearty dose of cinnamon. A strident tongue burn (surprising for 46%) is accompanied by a few dried fruits (apricot, date), a mouth-drying dollop of tannins, and a peanut buttery maltiness that reminds me of some porters.', ': Short. An herbal quality, something in between black tea and herb cough drops, dominates the finish. There is no bitterness, but also not much evolution. Subsequent sips have more oak and sugar in them, which brings the finish back into balance.', ': A few drops of water add a little more of that caramel (and some vanilla) to the aroma. The flavor seems a little brighter, with more nuttiness, as does the finish. Try both without and then with a little water.', ': ']"
182,GlenAllachie (12 year) ,"[': Initially shy, this requires a little rest in the glass to open up. When it does there’s a piercingly fruity, fresh sweet red wine note. Hidden below that are notes of chewy caramel, pear drops, dark chocolate, and buttery shortbread or maybe graham cracker. There’s more complexity below – as it rests in the glass it slowly reveals more. Give it time.', ': Pleasantly thick body, almost syrupy. A strong dark chocolate fudge note kicks off the party, followed by a mild tongue burn. After it clears, there’s some slightly bitter charcoal, buttery oak, and just a smear of grape jam.', ': Medium-long. The chocolate remains and turns bittersweet, like dry cocoa. Some of the other bitter elements creep back in, but remain balanced. Fades without evolution.', ': A few drops of water increase the nose tickle, necessitating another rest in the glass. Some of the jam comes forward and the bright red fruits are reawakened. The palate seems thinner, but sweeter. If your dram becomes a little boring, add some water to wake it up, but definitely try it without water first.', ': I can’t remember ever having a malt that tastes so much like chocolate. I expected some sherry elements from the aroma, but the fruit is decidedly in the background while the chocolate notes – bitter and sweet alike – take center stage. Certainly there are no off-notes, making this a very accomplished dram. The price seems right, as it’s an upgrade from your standard ']"

Even after some time to open up, it’s very light and shy.', ': Excellent creamy body, like a single-grain whisky. A bit sharp on the tongue burn, for a 46%. Resolves with marshmallow, raw pecans, and fresh sweet whipping cream. Light in character.', ': Tasty, with a soupy mix of vanilla bean, creme brulee, and vague nuttiness. Fades with an awesomely strong note of roasted chestnuts. Not at all bitter, but on the short side.', ': A few drops of water opens a little orange-blossom honey on the nose, and adds some kind of citrus to the palate. Seems otherwise not to affect the whisky. A few drops doesn’t hurt, but I wouldn’t try to add more for fear of washing out the already subtle flavors.', ': An interesting one. It has almost no presence in the nose, but shows really nice body on the tongue. It isn’t until the finish that the flavors really come to life. Seems odd to skip the smelling and tasting stages to get to the good stuff, but there it is. I wouldn’t rush out and buy a bottle of this, but it’s worth a shot if you see it on a bar menu, but drink it first in the lineup – I doubt it would stand up well next to other, more robust drams. I would guess that the extra five years in barrel would give the 15-year official bottling the assertiveness and complexity that is missing here.']"
184,Glencadam (13 year) “The Re-Awakening” ,"[': Soft, round notes of nougat and marshmallow, marzipan, and buttered scones (ok, ok, any buttered bakery item). Subtle and simple, but with depth of aroma and no rough edges.', ': Full-bodied, almost syrupy. Nougat upfront, with a moderate to heavy tongue burn. Chewy, with elements of burnt caramel, nut butters, and dried coconut. Pleasant, lightly sweet, and mild.', ': Medium length. Toasted brioche. Bittersweet chocolate, fades to light oak, toasted walnuts, and vanilla taffy.', ': The addition of a few drops of water seems to mute the nose, but amplifies a clear hazelnut flavor on the palate. Water optional here.', ': An accomplished, polished, and tasty expression of Glencadam, showing the distillery’s strengths. Although they have depth, the flavors and aromas here are subtle and well-integrated, meaning they require careful contemplation and should not be approached with an expectation of boldness or brashness, like one would with a peated or heavily-sherried malt. The ex-bourbon cask influence is clear, but understated, complementing but not dominating the soft grain and nutty-sweet malt. Its only real flaw is a hotter-than-expected tongue burn, a nitpick.']"
185,Glencadam (15 year) ,"[': Perfumed, and very floral. Rosewater, lilac, orange blossom, honeysuckle. Next, a wave of green banana, lime salt-water taffy, and kiwi. Exceedingly delicate, and all of the individual notes are ephemeral and fleeting. Underneath the perfume notes is a very thin foundation: very pale malt, mineral water, and banana leaves.', ': Medium body, not quite syrupy. A moderate tongue burn is followed by densely sweet honey, fondant, and buttercream frosting. Rosewater, again, with pistachio and nougat. Despite all the sugary notes, it is not cloying.', ': Medium-short. Still sweet, with a reprise of some of the floral notes from the palate (nice to see those come full-circle). Fades slowly with pear pastilles, bubblegum, and no bitterness at all.', ': A few drops of water bring an odd, ferny vegetal note to the aroma which chases away all of the flowers, which don’t really come back even with a rest in the glass. The palate seems thinner and actually less sweet, with an added tart note of lime. Water is not really needed here, at 46% I think it’s proofed correctly.', ': A delicate dram with a host of mostly floral notes to explore. The palate, far from being delicate, is like smooshing your face into a wedding cake. There are no off-notes, although everything seems tied together with spun sugar without a whole lot of substance underneath. It’s a tasty if unsatisfying meal of a dram, although I hesitate to recommend any 15 year-old single malt that rises to the triple digits in price. If you can find it for $60, I think that’s about where it should reside. I suggest waiting until late 2019 when the supply returns to normal.']"
186,Glendalough 7 Year Single Malt Irish Whiskey ,"[': Fruit-forward, and bright. Piercing tropical fruits (primarily kiwi) and white peach. Green tea, something floral (jasmine or honeysuckle maybe), green apple, and a very light malty sweetness. Very appealing.', ': Medium-bodied. Huge amount of coconut up front, both dried and fresh, with an edge of milk chocolate. Black pepper, light malt, and graham cracker appear after a brief and mild tongue burn.', ': Short. A little tannic. Walnut meats, oak, and a fading hint of brown sugar or molasses.', ': A few drops of water sweetens up the aroma, but replaces fresh fruit notes with processed candy ones. It also adds a touch of nougat or caramel. The palate actually feels a little hotter, and there are no extra flavors. I would skip the water here, it’s not needed and it messes with a delicate balance.', ': A very tasty malt, and has none of the off-flavors associated with most young malts.

Cake frosting. Flawless nose – deep and inviting, but very (very) sweet.', ': Medium-bodied – slightly chewy, which is the only hint this is GlenDronach at its core. Pear drops, golden raisins, apricot Turkish Delight. Sweet. Almost – but not quite – cloyingly so.', ': Medium-short. First the mouth is enrobed in a candy-apple coating. This is stripped away by a flash of acidic freshly-squeezed white grape juice, which lingers while a hint of bitter, sappy oak creeps in. It fades away with green grape skins. ', ': Water opens up a few cereal notes, but dulls some of the complexity in the nose. The water has a nice congealing effect on the palate – lessening the syrup and heightening the golden raisins and fresh grapes. Ditto on the finish. Definitely try this with water – but try it without first.', ': The experience is very similar to a syrup I made once by re-hydrating golden raisins in white port. Yum. This is dessert whisky, and no bones about it. While the GlenDronach house style (meaty/oily) is missing here – likely because the house style is closely associated with the sherry character of the flagship expressions – this is still one robust, flavor-filled escapade of a whisky. Sweet to the point of cloying, but excellently balanced by a grapey acidity and fruity complexity. Truly a pleasure, especially for a lover of dessert wines. I am not disappointed in my purchase from across the pond.']"
189,GlenDronach (15 year) Revival ,"[': Sawdust and wood sap. Then, sticky molasses, port wine reduction, and fig jam. The fruit here is dark, dense, and resinous, and the malt serves only as a platform for the intensely concentrated sherry notes. Accompanying the fruit notes is an unctuous, meaty, greasy component that is the hallmark of GlenDronach’s house style – something like a cross between Teriyaki beef jerky, sun-dried tomatoes, and axle grease. But in a good way. A long rest in the glass reveals – as it often does with single-malt, an aromatic vanilla note.', ': Thin body, but oh how fruity. Assorted jams, raisins, prunes, and fig all served up on a platter of well-aged malt. The savory/greasy character shows through quickly, and keeps the Teriyaki theme going.', ': At last, the fruit freshens up and becomes cherry lozenge, young red wine, grape soda, and a background of ripe fig. A mild sense of Red Vines (“red” licorice) is followed by a slight woodiness – no bitterness! – and a lingering meatiness. Beef jerky again.', ': A few drops of water reveals some vanilla extract and a mild floral character which is somewhat at odds with the sherry notes. Odd, I would have expected it to awaken fresh fruit aromas. The water does emphasize those fresh fruits on the tongue, though, particularly the cherry. It does the same on the finish. Cherry again. I wouldn’t bother with the water here, as it masks some of those sticky resin notes.', ': Like the 12 year, this is fruity and savory at the same time. However, where the 12 year has many fresh fruit flavors, in three more years the 15 has quickly become more concentrated and resinous. There is an umami component that is more apparent than in the 12 year, like soy sauce without the salt, and it pairs beautifully with the dried fruit and sticky prune character. Chinese plum sauce might be a good way to sum up the flavor profile. To me, this shows what sherry aging is capable of doing to a malt, and goes way beyond simply being ‘sweet’. Like ']"
190,GlenDronach (18 year) Allardice ,"[': Heavily resinous, with a dense balsamic vinegar note and oily, compost-y, earthy sherry. Definitely GlenDronach (not at all like, say, ', ': Thin body. Prune up front, with more sherry resin, tobacco (shisha), and raw apple cider vinegar. Dry, really, without much of the sugar one would associate with sherry bombs. Raisiny in the extreme.', ': Deep, dark, fungal depths of resinous sherry. There’s a lot in there to plumb. Fades with a little mint and berry, and some mouth-drying barrel tannin. No bitterness.', ': A few drops of water add a ton of vanilla and a port wine-like sweetness. It also evens-out the palate, providing a little more fresh fruit to offset the prunes. Water is an excellent idea here.', ': Huh. This has more deep, dark, concentrated dry fruit than I’ve ever experienced in a single malt. I’m not sure that’s actually a good thing. It’s quite dry, without any of the sugar one would expect in a “fruity” sherried malt. That sherry also covers up any malt characteristics. I wouldn’t call it particularly well-balanced, but it is well-made and provides the kind of unctuous quality one expects in an 18-year. A few drops of water also makes up for this malt’s inefficiencies. Still, for around $150, I expect a little more.']"

Port wine reduction drizzled over ripe strawberries nestled into butterscotch pudding. This smells like I imagined the ', ': Full, syrupy body. Restrained tongue burn considering its ABV. Rivers of molten dark chocolate greet the tongue, studded with plump figs and dried apricots. Oaky in a controlled, precise way, perfectly supporting the layers of fruit and sweet. In a word, perfect.', ': Medium-long. How did they cram all of this dark chocolate flavor in here? It continues through the finish, now with bursting pomegranate arils, liquid caramel, and fudge. Begins to fade with mint chocolate chips and fresh whole cloves.', ': I almost couldn’t bring myself to do it, but after adding 6 drops of water to the (probably) 10ml left in my glass, I can smell elevated levels of tart cherry without a lessening of the other notes. The palate might be a little silkier in texture, but strangely less coherent. The finish picks up a note of tobacco and fresh undyed leather. This really doesn’t need the intervention of water, but you can play with some if you feel the desire.', ': If you couldn’t tell from the over-the-top language in the above notes, this is an incredible whisky. One of the best, literally, that I have ever had. It strikes all of the bells for me: Sweet and fruity sherry without being overly resinous or sulfurous. Decadently full flavor without excessive alcohol burn. Mountains of chocolate, to degrees I’ve never experienced in a whisky. It starts confidently, strides across the palate without faltering and finishes with elegance, retaining its integrity. A whole, full, round, complete whisky.']"

Hazelnuts, black licorice, and some assorted dried fruits.', ': On the short side. Finally some real fruit, with sherry-derived raisins, dates, and dried apple. Fades quickly without much evolution.', ': The addition of a few drops of water brings nothing new to the party, either to the aroma or the tongue. I could take or leave water with this one.', ': Frankly, there is a reason that most good single malt is aged in excess of a decade, just like most good music is made with care, time and money in the studio. It matters. This is not markedly better than blended scotches or NAS malts that are priced lower, and the only value to the admirer of GlenDronach is to highlight how vital those extra 4 years of sherry maturation are to this distillery’s output. The aroma is too spirity and the fruit notes are sparse. The tongue burn is too hot, although the flavors are nice. The finish is too short. The addition of some ex-bourbon barrels to the vat robs the expression of GlenDronach’s house character. It’s not a bad dram, certainly, but it’s not even remotely close to the quality of ']"

Raspberry coulis and the barest shavings of fresh oak wood. Ends elegantly, without bitterness.', ': Good for a 12 year, but not a whole lot of sherry character. Would be great value at $40, but it suffers from a case of overpricing of entry level malt: Not substantially better than other sherried 12 year-olds, but priced at the psychologically detrimental $50 mark.

Again, the flavors center around dried fruits, jams, and apple. Near the end, there’s also a black licorice element.', ': Of medium length. Blackberry jam, drying red wine tannins (like the dregs at the bottom of a big fruit-forward red). Fades quickly without much residue.', ': A few drops of water actually seem to collapse the aroma, muting all of the fruit and adding nothing. If you add water, make sure to give it a lengthy rest before sampling. The palate becomes maltier, with more of a graham cracker note, but (again) with less fruit. Just skip the water here.', ': A mid-line sherried malt, without the “big fruit” hallmarks of a true sherry monster, but with plenty of berry, wine, and resin to produce the desired effect. The fruits are subdued, but do contain that aged, balsamic, resinous quality, and are balanced by slight malty sweetness. This is the kind of drink you reach for when you want to lean back and relax on a chilly winter evening, but not necessarily think too hard about what’s in your glass. As it’s not sold in the US my American readers might consider this one the next time a friend or family member is traveling to Europe. You know, as a souvenir.']"

No bitterness at all, and while the finish is only of medium length, it resounds to the end with crisp citrusy sherry and lightly caramelly malt.', ': Yum. Very enjoyable. Of course, it’s $90, so… not exactly great value, but if you compare it to some of the $100+ 18 year-olds on the market, it stands up well.']"
197,Glenfarclas 105 Cask Strength ,"[': Sherry bomb. Dry, with most of the fruit notes of the “dried fruit” variety. Dried red currants, dried orange peel. Are dried raspberries a thing? If so, those too. Other than that, a hint of candle wax, and surprisingly little nose tickle for such a high ABV.', ': Thin body. Fruit punch gummy candies (Gummi Bears) make an initial impression, which is followed by a brief but painful wave of Help-Help-My-Tongue-Is-On-Fire (that’s a medical term). This clears quickly, leaving more dried fruits, raspberry jam, orange peel, and those fake gummy bits in that awful shelf-stable vintage Christmas fruitcake. (That’s a professional whisky-taster term. I’m pretty sure I read it in a magazine.)', ': Long. The dried fruits reign. A little bit of vegetal “bramble” appears, and fades with the rest. Not bitter, but not particularly sweet either.', ': A few drops of water give this some of the sweetness that it’s yearning for, and freshens some of the fruit. It lessens the tongue burn very slightly, and adds a little vanilla frosting to the finish. Water is decidedly not a bad idea with this whisky.', ': I’m sorry, but I don’t like this. I’m generally a sucker for sherry bombs, and I’m not shy of cask strength whiskies, but I find this very one-dimensional. Back in the day when this was $50 a bottle it made a lot of sense – you got a high-proof, sherry-flecked ‘farclas for reasonable money and you didn’t need it to justify itself via quality because it was cheap and big and powerful.

Not as tart as the aroma implied.', ': Medium-short. Some slightly-bitter barrel char. Vague, without much of the fruit but with some of the herbs. Fades without evolving.', ': The addition of a few drops of water muddy the tropical fruits and add only a little sweetness in the form of bland white sugar. The palate is thinner, but the finish has some sparkle and a little of the missing tartness. I’d probably skip the water at 43% ABV, but you could see if it does anything for you.', ': The aroma promises more than the palate can deliver, but it’s still a pleasant dram with nice fruit flavors. The sherry notes, which dominate, are definitely of the “fresh tropical fruit” variety, and not of the “dried and jammy fruit” variety. There are no off-notes, and the whisky’s balance is well-struck. I snagged my bottle on closeout for $27, making it a steal, but I’d be just about as happy with this at $40. Much above that and the value falls away. If you have access to both the 10 and the 12, I think that the 12 is better and worth an extra $10-$15, but I wouldn’t pay more than $50 for it.']"

After an intense fiery tongue burn, notes of dark chocolate, fig, and browned pie crust dominate.', ': Medium-long. Here the fruit notes are more dried, specifically dried cherries. The chocolate remains, which is a nice combination, and both remain long enough to convey a chocolate-covered cherry coincidence.

Water does help, with a boost in the tart lemon/lemonade character, which provides better balance and more dynamism. Still, this isn’t something that everyone will be happy with after a blind purchase. If this were competing at entry-level tier of $30 to $40, it would be a solid choice.

It’s mildly complex, with some interesting fruit notes that I didn’t expect.

Medium long.', ': A splash of water dulls the nose and adds some citrus.

The madeira effect is less of wine and more of deeply sugary treats. All of the tastes and smells that come to mind are dripping with crystalized sugar and deep, concentrated fruits.

Tart red wine, dark chocolate-covered cherries, roasted mixed nuts. The tart notes are in no way astringent or tannic. The impression, overall, is of bright, fresh, red grapes, nuts, and chocolate. Delicious, especially as a dessert.', ': Medium-long. Echoes of the original aromas, nuts, chocolate, fruit, and some taffy. As it fades, the chocolate note becomes more like bittersweet chocolate or cocoa nib.', ': At 46%, it certainly doesn’t need intervention with water. A few drops do a little to heighten the fresh fruit, but at the expense of the chocolate. Mildly sweeter – caramel – on the palate, but with a bit more tongue burn.

It’s worth a try with some water but don’t drown it.', ': I’m not sure if this evokes the era of the Savoy Hotel or the Age of Enlightenment or whatever the website says, but it’s a fine, straightforward dram with a lot of refined flavor.

The fruit character is fresher and more tart than the sticky, dried-fruit profile of sherry aging. Some vanilla oak underlies – but does not compete with – the fruit. Well-balanced, refreshing, and thankfully not cloying.', ': Medium bodied, with initial aspects of caramel or nougat. A tad on the burny side. The fruit is fainter, but more reminiscent of ruby port.', ': Medium-long. Caramel again, and marshmallow. The fruit returns only as a faint candy coating as the whole fades into mild barrel char.', ': Water awakens some indistinct tart fruit on the nose, but also something like sulphur. Perhaps it’s the chlorine in the water where I’m tasting (I’m on vacation!), but I don’t enjoy the addition of water here.', ': Port finishing is not common, but is always a welcome pairing for a single malt, especially one as well-suited to cask manipulation as Glenmorangie. Unlike other port finishes, Quinta Ruban is priced to be accessible. While it cannot compete with, say, a Springbank port-finish for complexity, at $46 it is a satisfying dram with pleasing flavors and especially aromas. You can do a lot worse with $46.']"

This doesn’t fade, but is quickly overtaken by a round, juicy, sweet ruby port note that is somewhere in between candy apple and berry preserves. The two opposing notes combine into balsamic or rancio and balance out. The port note does seem to drown out the malt, which stays resolutely in the background. ', ': Medium bodied, almost syrupy. A robust tongue burn brings notes of cinnamon and jalapeno jelly, and then recedes to show sweet dried berries, grape jam, and a dusting of cocoa powder. Tasty.', ': Medium-short. The rancio note returns, along with slightly bitter walnut and charcoal notes. The finish is must less sweet than the palate, but retains the same essence. This fades quickly, though, leaving just a vague dusty grape-skin note.', ': A few drops of water initially mute the aroma. After a rest in the glass, there’s a marked increase in alcohol bite and a lot less sweetness. Texture is unaffected, but the palate is muddier and confused. Skip the water here.', ': At first, this is a little more disappointing than I remember from when it was 12 years old. The port notes are nice, but are accompanied by an uncomfortable musty character that I can’t quite shake. The Glenmorangie malt – always a bit of a wallflower – is totally subsumed by the port. On the upside, the palate is well-rounded and satisfying, with good depth of flavor. Luckily, the disappointment fades as the bottle rests, perhaps through oxidation or perhaps it’s shaking some bottle shock. Whatever the reason, if you have an issue with your first glass – give it another try a week later, or maybe even decant it to encourage the oxidation a little. Once my bottle and I came to an understanding, I amended my review up to a “Recommended”.']"

Deeper examination yields a slightly unpleasant antiseptic note which, it should be remembered, seems to vanish in slightly older (or aggressively cask-finished) Glenmorangie malts.', ': Medium bodied. A solid butterscotch foundation, with some slightly bitter barrel tannins, and more antiseptic. Nothing is built on that foundation, however.', ': Of medium length, with an unfortunate echo of both the rubbing alcohol and the bitter oak notes leading the way. A slathering of vanilla frosting, and a ghost of bitter herbs.', ': Water, as usual, amps the floral notes in the nose, revealing rosewater. It brings a hint of orange peel to the palate, and rounds off a few of the rougher edges. I urge the use of water with this one – it patches up a lot of the holes.', ': Despite my adoration for older Glenmorangies, I have a hard time loving The Original. While its price must be considered – it’s hard to find decent competition for a $35 single malt – this particular bottle hits two of my three least favorite whisky characteristics: bitterness and “rough” rubbing alcohol (luckily it doesn’t have any of that ‘rotten banana’ aroma that I despise). The nose is noteworthy – showing a lot of promise with honey, florals, and a hint of that Glenmorangie elegance, but it gets shaky on the tongue and then all falls apart on the finish. Luckily, a dash of water improves the malt to the point that I’m interested in a second glass.']"

Beyond that, there is something industrial tasting, like the oil/glue notes found in ', ': Medium-short. Slightly nutty, with hazelnuts and echoes of the cinnamon and clove spice notes. Fades with dusty hay and dried coconut.', ': A few drops of water bring out more fruit notes – apple cider, poached pears, and wildflower honey, and add more spice and brighter alcohol on the palate. I recommend a very little water with this one.', ': A very well-made, but ultimately uninteresting dram. The Autumn flavors and aromas are nice, but seem like just variations on the standard “barley” grain flavors that trigger some kind of taste or smell memory from my youth. The attempt to showcase the Marris Otter barley by stripping away other flavors (using only ex-bourbon casks, and particularly light ones at that) has produced an introspective examination of the barley strain’s personality that, like an educational show on TV, doesn’t elicit much excitement. It’s a nice whisky, and very pleasant to drink, but plenty of cheaper malts can claim the same.']"
223,Glenturret (10 year) ,"[': Highland, with nose-crinkling oils and a sooty, earthy fungal note (mild peat, perhaps from the water). Apricot pits, woody caramels, and lemon curd.', ': Syrupy body. Sweet, with some honey and butterscotch up front. Minimal tongue burn. Cereal grains show through, tasting like puffed-barley breakfast cereal. Mild oak. Little fruit.', ': Medium length. Fruit more noticeable here, like apricot jam. A hint of soot and some drying oaky tannins. Fades without bitterness.', ': A very few drops of water seems to heavily mute the aroma, replacing it with a very faint nuttiness. The palate is also muted, while the finish pops with acidic lemon and more fruit. I wouldn’t bother with water here, although the change to the finish is notable.', ': A very tasty whisky with no glaring flaws. As is often the case with single malts aged for middling amounts of time in only ex-bourbon casks, the flavors are consistent and only mildly interesting. I hesitate to say “forgettable”. The mild peat notes are interesting, but really just end up dirtying the fruits and cereals. I’m holding out for the re-launch of the 10 year, in hopes that it will represent better wood management or cask selection, or perhaps a combination of barrel types.']"
224,Gooderham & Worts Four Grain Canadian Whisky ,"[': Spicy, but in a cloyingly sweet way (like cinnamon and cardamom in syrup). Corn syrup… maple syrup… all the syrups. The grain profiles seem to be buried under four to five layers of treacly heavy sweetness, although some notes of sweet corn, green apple, and lemon peel peek through like shipwrecked sailors drowning in an ocean of corn syrup.', ': Medium bodied with a very low, gentle tongue burn. Again, the first impression is one of spice, while all of the following flavors are syrup and candy and sweetness. A bit of dried cinnamon and clove, and a hint of acetone near the end, alas.', ': Short. The acetone appears quickly, and is paired with a slightly bitter or astringent charcoal note. The sweetness seems to have ended, but there also doesn’t appear to be much underneath it. Fades quickly.', ': Several drops of water initially wash out the aroma, and increase the nose tickle. After a rest in the glass there might be an extra green pear note. The palate seems unchanged. Water optional, but I don’t think it helps.', ': I’m pretty disappointed. I expected something closer to ']"
225,Gordon & MacPhail: Mortlach (15 year) ,"[': Meaty dried figs, sweet fresh hay, and something savory like a soy sauce glaze on short ribs. Elegant and robust, although none of the aromas are overdone. Unmistakably sherried, but not a “sherry bomb”. A slight smoky vegetal note arises after a rest in the glass – smouldering wet leaves – although the effect is not strong enough to call it peat.', ': Heavy bodied – almost oily. Like the aroma, the flavor balances sweet and savory, with jam and cooked fruit flavors marrying with toasted oats and buttery oak. The effect on the tongue is heavy, slightly sweet, and complex.', ': Medium-long, and warming. Stewed plums, coffee cake, and wet hay. Not bitter.', ': A few drops of water seem to bring out a weird vegetable aroma – almost like celery. Weird. Certainly experiment with a little water, once you reach the bottom of your glass, but otherwise there’s no need for water here.', ': A stately, refined example of sherried Mortlach. Something about this distillery speaks of the Scotland of yore. Having never experienced the Scotland of yore, I can only assume it’s the combination of excellent sherry casks with the meaty, oily, rough-around-the-edges malt of Mortlach that gives me the impression. Mortlach is a necessary education for any lover of scotch, and the 15 year-old available currently from Gordon & MacPhail is a fine tutelage, especially considering that the alternative is the official bottling at $110!']"
226,Grant’s 12 year-old Blended Scotch ,"[': Orange peel, honeyed malt. Sweet and bready like sugar cookie dough. Simple, and doesn’t change in the glass.', ': Syrupy body. Sweet and simple, but with some weight. Honey up front, with a continuation of the cookie-dough theme. Slightly bitter citrus peels follow, and a tinge of barrel char.', ': Short. Yeasty, with a reprise of the palate notes, plus a little cinnamon. Fades quickly without evolving.', ': A few drops of water open up a dusty spice cabinet, with spent clove and dried-up ginger. The palate is, however, a little more complex and with a bit more spice. This doesn’t really need the water, but isn’t hurt by it.', ': Unchallenging but enjoyable. A good “I don’t want to think about it too hard” kind of dram, without any rough edges or unexpected twists. Sweeter than most other mid-aged blends, but with less fruit. The Girvan grain component keeps its head down, and does not contribute any off flavors or betray any youthful alcohol notes. Of course this is discontinued, I would buy more if it weren’t. Similar in a lot of ways to ']"

228,Great King Street: Glasgow Blend ,"[': A whiff of peat greets the nose first – there’s no shying away from the peat in this blend. The peat is a little smoky and airily herbal, but I can’t place it as Laphroaig, Lagavulin, or Ardbeg. Underlying the peat are wisps of fruit in the form of crushed berries and unripe figs. While it has more presence than ', ': Deep, earthy notes of tobacco and fruitwood smoke. A pleasantly creamy body without tongue burn, and more wisps of fruit. Subtle but artful. The fruit is present, but weaves into the peat effortlessly. Well played Mr. Glaser.', ': Medium length. The peat earthiness continues, growing a little more smoky and allowing the fruit to drop away. As it fades, there are hints of oak tannins and then the whole becomes mineral and dry.', ': A few drops of water tame the smoke, and bring out a few soft cereal notes on the tongue. They also seem to chase away the fruit from the sherry. I don’t see the need for water with this one.', ': John Glaser continues to do what scotch blending companies have been advertising that they do for decades. He takes a components that are worth drinking on their own and crafts something with them that is truly impressive for under $50 a bottle. If you’ve ever tasted blended scotch and thought it needed more flavor, or wished for some real peat presence in ']"
229,Green Spot Château Léoville-Barton Irish Whiskey ,"[': A duality of bright, fresh, bursting red berries and intense, cooked, stonefruit jam. Light and airy, but with a strong foundation of malt and pot-still barley notes (like oatmeal cookies). Sweet coconut cream. Delectable.', ': Soft and creamy. A bit of tongue burn. Soft grains, malt, toffee, and blonde fudge, with a drizzle of blackberry coulis.', ': Sweet and dessert-y, more coconut cream (filling), raspberry jam, and vanilla bean ice cream.', ': A few drops of water reveal some sherry notes – fig and fruitcake – as well as an almost Sauternes-like honeyed grape aroma. Water does not go amiss here, but don’t be heavy-handed lest you drown out some of the more delicate flavors.', ': Unlike ']"
230,Green Spot Irish Whiskey ,"[': Clearly sherried. Orange peel and candied ginger. Tangy and somewhat herbal. Green pear and cotton candy. Honey-lemon throat lozenges. After a rest in the glass, there is a fibrous fruitiness, like the skin of a red delicious apple. Even further in is a faint whiff of the nutty coconut I associate with bourbon-matured pot still whiskey.', ': Unctuous body – mouth coating. Minimal burn. Spicy ginger, apple cider, and nondescript grain.', ': Medium length, the honey and lemon lozenge remains behind as the spicy notes fade. No trace of bitterness. Simple and refreshing.', ': A splash of water reveals bright, fresh green banana on the nose, really washes out the palate, and adds a little peanut butter note to the finish. I wouldn’t recommend the water for how it affects the body. At 40% ABV, it hardly needs further dilution.', ': While it has the same mouth-filling unctuousness as ']"
231,Greenore (8 year) Single-Grain Irish Whiskey ,"[': Heavy grain notes – hay, white glue, industrial solvent (paint thinner). Some faint notes of vanilla and sugar cookies. After a lengthy rest in the glass, the weird notes are partially covered up by sweeter ones… now it’s sweet glue, sweet paint thinner, etc.', ': Syrupy body. Mild caramel, heavy dried coconut and coconut water, more industrial glues.', ': Short. Faintly sweet, with a lot more vanilla and some honeyed notes. No bitterness or really any oak tannins to speak of.', ': A few drops of water have no noticeable effect. I would skip the water, especially at the anemic bottling strength of 40% ABV.', ': It’s hard to get past that paint thinner on the nose, but once you do the experience is like a milder, subtler, simpler ']"
232,Hancock’s President’s Reserve ,"[': Meltingly sumptuous fruit notes of mango sorbet, kiwi, and Red Delicious apples. Floral notes of honeysuckle and damnit-I-don’t-know-flowers-but-they’re-in-there. Clover honey, fresh hay, and a hint of marzipan. The aroma keeps evolving as I nose it. Now coconut cream pie, now plum wine, now pineapple juice. Wow.', ': Thin body. Mai Tai (high-end fruit punch, I guess?), fresh banana, and black tea precede a mild to moderate tongue burn. Which – I expected more! – doesn’t seem to evolve much on the tongue.', ': Long. Lemon verbena, tobacco leaf, slightly bitter barrel char, pencil shavings (oh God I sound like a wine snob), and corn pudding. The finish doesn’t evolve much, but it does definitely linger.', ': Several drops of water wake up some extra fruit notes of tropical persuasion. I dunno… passion fruit? The palate is a little livelier, the finish fruitier. I’d definitely recommend trying this with some water after a few sips neat.', ': Excellent. I didn’t know what it was at the time I tasted, but damn is it tasty. The aroma – especially – goes on for days and makes this some of the tightest-packed fruit-forward bourbon I’ve ever smelled. For $45 this is an experience that is not worth passing over. If you can find it and you already like bourbon, get it. It’s really not like anything else I’ve had, even from Buffalo Trace. If you can’t find it, don’t fret – another batch will be along eventually… just don’t pay $120 for it online. It’s not worth that.']"
233,Hankey Bannister Original Blended Scotch ,"[': Light grain, lemon peel, and a heavy dose of grain neutral spirit (vodka).', ': Nice, creamy mouthfeel. A Glenkinchie-like lemon pervades the flavor, and isn’t much balanced by anything, including the continuing vodka notes.', ': Short. A slight marshmallow sweetness, lemon candy, and vodka. Finishes with – you guessed it – vodka.', ': A few drops of water heighten the citrus notes – adding grapefruit, notably – but do little on the tongue or finish. Water neither hurts nor helps.', ': Some part of me thought that a little-known (in the States) homestyle blend might carry with it a cure for the common blend, perhaps carrying the Old World love of blended scotch into the modern age. Alas, this is brown vodka in the worst sense, with entirely too much “light whisky” – practically grain neutral spirit or vodka – without nearly enough flavorful malt to fill it out. The only things it has going for it, aside from the silly British name, is a bumped ABV and some pleasant lemon notes.']"
234,Hart Brothers Laphroaig 18 year ,[]
235,Hazelburn (12 year) ,"[': White pepper, honey, and mild floral funkiness that almost smells like peat. The funky note is just potent enough to add complexity in the form of a floral spike and a citrus twist to an otherwise baseline malt profile: honey, caramel, plain oak. A rest in the glass allows a pear note to develop.', ': Medium, syrupy body. Delectable – a striking balance between green apple / lemon-lime tartness and oaky, brown-sugar flecked sweet malt. The whole is underlain by a murky, dusty complexity. A whisky to contemplate.', ': Medium-long. First, piney floral notes give way to lemon zest and then not-quite-bitter oaky tannin. Not as lingering as a peated malt, but also fades without bitterness.', ': A few drops of water amp up the vanilla notes, adding a sweet “cream soda” element to both the aroma and palate. I suggest trying without water first, and then witness the change that occurs with a few drops.', ': Whereas ']"
236,Hazelburn (8 year) ,"[': White peach and vanilla. Very mild and soft, elements of sugar cookie and white raspberry, and a ghost of spearmint. Elegant and floral, but not very complex.', ': Mildly creamy body, with some high acidic notes of green fruits and dry white wine. Progresses into white chocolate and macadamia nuts.', ': A hint of Springbank style, with a nutty oiliness that only emerges on the finish. Hazelnut skins, vanilla bean, and rice pudding. On the tail end, a little bitterness.', ': A spare few drops of water bring out a little green apple skin in the nose, but also up the octane of the alcohol vapors. Water adds a suggestion of … peat?! to the palate, although it fades quickly. I would leave out the water.', ': Very light and unassuming. A bit like Auchentoshan, but with nuttier flavors like hazelnut and white chocolate. Worth the price of a full bottle? Only if you’re crazy for the lighter style of triple-distilled whisky.', ': Turns out ']"
237,Henry McKenna Bourbon ,"[': Fruit punch and/or tutti-frutti. Bubblegum. Some nose tickle but no paint thinner or rubbing alcohol notes. Light, and one-dimensional.', ': Thin body. The fruit punch note returns on the palate, along with some marshmallow, bubble gum, cotton candy, and corn syrup.', ': Medium-short. Slight barrel char, and a hint of menthol. Not bitter. Fades without evolving.', ': A few drops of water amplify the ‘fake’ fruit notes a bit, which bodes well for mixability. The liquid is even thinner on the tongue, but the finish has more vibrancy and more fruit. Water isn’t a bad idea with this one, but certainly isn’t needed.', ': That fruit-punch note shows up in low-end bourbons, including ']"
238,Henry McKenna K&L Single Barrel (10 year) ,"[': Pecan pie, heavy spices (cinnamon, clove) and a hearty dose of cherry liqueur. After a rest in the glass, there’s a yeasty bread note and apparent oak.', ': Sweet corn up front, with a distinct woodiness – not unpleasant. Some initial burn, but not too harsh for 100 proof. Cherry cola, cough syrup, and marzipan. A hint of bitter herbs.', ': Long. Sweet notes, including the oak, linger. At the tail end, a suggestion of mint and charcoal. Slightly more bitterness than I like in the finish.', ': Water adds some perfume to the nose – the cherry becomes cherry blossoms – and the oak becomes sappier and sweeter. The palate also benefits from the water, becoming a little better integrated and a bit more tart. Here’s a great example of a mediocre whiskey that blossoms into elegance with just the addition of H', ': Cost $27 but drinks like a $45 bourbon. A hefty 100 proof gives weight, and the rye-inflected standard bourbon notes are all accounted for and in the proper proportions. I could wish for a little more silkiness in the body and a bit more caramel and less charcoal in the wood notes, but all around a decent workhorse whiskey. A few drops of water elevate it to a $55 bourbon. Did I mention it was $27?']"
239,Hibiki (12 year) Japanese Whisky ,"[': Orange peel, and some very aromatic florals (cherry blossom?). The grain component is soft and yeasty, and an altogether foreign aroma pervades – this is when I race to my computer to learn this whisky is partially matured in ', ': Not as creamy as expected, but the grain is soft and there is a pillowy texture to it. Light malt, light wood (marshmallow), and a teasing bright, acidic young fruitiness. The little bit of oak present here is nothing more than a frame for holding the canvas of grain on which these flavors are painted. Woah, apparently Japanese whisky makes me wax poetic. Did I already talk about cherry blossoms?', ': There’s the plum again, and the grain whisky yields to some really nice steamed bun and buttered scone flavors. The finish is quite short, leaving behind only a minerally taste – like good spring water. Very clean and crisp.', ': A few drops of water makes the nose somewhat more cereally. However, it really makes the fruit notes dance on the tongue – lots of fresh acidity and green fruits appear. This dram is definitely well-served by a small (SMALL) addition of water.', ': For me, this dances circles around every Yamazaki single malt I’ve had, even the 18. Where Yamazaki seems to be all about heat and banana (its effect on me is very similar to that of younger ']"
240,High West Double Rye! (New Recipe) ,"[': Complex, with a distinct “young rye” eucalyptus/menthol note that is well-balanced and held in check by a malty sweet cinnamon-roll character, complete with that sinful white confectioner’s glaze. Deeper in the glass, there are some rye grain and flour notes (bready, yeasty, nutty).', ': Syrupy body. Moderate to severe tongue burn – a little hot for 46% ABV. Again, the sweetness of the older rye perfectly balances the vibrancy and grassiness of the younger. Both are detectable. Toasty, nutty, sweet, and complex. Nice.', ': Medium or medium-long. All of the previous notes continue into the finish. Fades with a dash of charcoal, but no bitterness.', ': A few drops of water serve to integrate the components more fully – it’s now harder to discern the young rye and the old rye. Beyond that, the palate gains a hint of bakery goodies… ', ': Pleasant, well-balanced, and just complex enough to justify the price. Some of the particularities of this whiskey are likely to be lost in a cocktail, although if you’re used to a bottom-shelf rye in your Manhattans, this is going to be a noticeable step up. As a mixing rye, though, I don’t think it’s necessarily better than ']"
241,Highland Park (12 year) ,"[': First impression is of warm, earthy peat. Beneath, a layer of lemon oil and candied lemon peel. Sharp ginger, grapefruit juice. Freshly-baked gingersnap cookies. As it sits in the glass, the citrus notes darken and give hints of blood orange and marmalade. Orkney peat is unmistakable, and here it is vibrant and enthusiastic, although there’s an off-note to the alcohol – just a hair too young. A long rest in the glass reveals some velvety vanilla and lavender.', ': Medium-bodied, almost silky, and quite smooth. Up front there’s a bitter note – burned almonds – which fades as waves of malted grains, brown sugar, lemon custard, and caramel cover the tongue. The smokiness that was missing from the nose appears here in the form of smouldering hay and spent matches. On the tongue it develops a woody cast, and slants towards varnish.', ': Long. The bitter notes re-emerge. Blackened wood and spent campfire war a bit with the clean, citrusy flavors. Unfortunately, the bitter woody notes prevail and last several minutes. This negative effect seems to fade the more you drink… or maybe that’s just the alcohol talking!', ': Water brightens the peat in the nose considerably, yielding freshly-squeezed lemon juice and cider vinegar, and heightening the alcohol tickle. On the tongue there is more malt upfront, with soft caramels, mushroomy peat, and roasted almonds. The finish may be slightly less bitter, although woodsmoke and barrel tannin persist. This dram is significantly improved, overall, by the water. I recommend its addition highly.', ': By the time this ']"

Sweet, light, and with only an echo of floral Orkney peat.', ': Thin body. Mild tongue burn. Somewhat sweet on the tongue – shortbread or biscuits. Very slightly acrid – charcoal maybe.', ': Long ish. The citrus peel returns, along with some bitter barrel tannin and rosewater. Fades slowly without added complexity.', ': Several drops of water brings out a Lemon Pledge note – turning citrus peels into citrus-scented cleanser. The palate seems softer, with a bit more malt. No need for water here.', ': This is very similar to the ', ' it is!']"
244,Hirsch Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': A little plastic-y up front, which suggests a rest in the glass is in order. Dry and woody, with oak sawdust, charcoal, and faint rock candy. Even after a rest in the glass, the plastic character remains, although a hint of marzipan (almond paste) and cherry syrup creep in.', ': Medium bodied. Pretty hot, for a 46% ABV. Sawdust and charcoal dominate, with elements of woody molasses and tobacco. ', ': Medium-short. A nice cinnamon-and-sugar note appears on the finish, along with mildly bitter barrel char and some mouth-drying oaky tannins.', ': A few drops of water perk up the apparent sweetness a little, although the whiskey also yields more fake “plastic” notes in addition. The palate is softer and burns less, but no interesting flavors are revealed. Water optional.', ': The whole impression is of dryness and austerity. The flavor and aroma components are sparse, there is very little in the way of sweetness, and no fruit or floral notes to balance the wood. Despite the claims on the bottle, this is a very squarely bottom-shelf bourbon which can disappear into any cocktail you choose without breaking the bank. For what it’s worth, at $25 this is a reasonable deal, just don’t expect anything interesting if drinking it neat.']"
245,Hochstadter’s Rye ,"[': A burst of florals and fruits: red apple, freshly-ground cinnamon and clove, violets, and faint peppermint. Complex, and yet light, airy, vibrant, and fresh. This is the kind of whiskey that pulls your nose in deeper. Excellent.', ': Thin body. Spicy, with cinnamon red hots, and a spike of alcohol burn. This resolves into gingerbread, pickled ginger (gari), cherry cordials (minus the chocolate), and a slight oaky sweetness (although the overall impression is quite dry).', ': On the short side. Red apple skin tannins, ground ginger and cardamom (anise-like). Fades with assorted (and muddled) dusty spice cabinet jars.', ': Water actually seems to mute the aromatic variety of this rye, instead making it hotter (more nose tickle). The palate gains a caraway (rye bread) note, and is a little less muddled. The finish is also more vibrant, and has a bit of tartness to it. I would skip the water when drinking this neat to preserve the aroma, but this tells me that melting ice in a cocktail will only improve the melding of this rye with other ingredients.', ': While the palate and finish are a little muddy, the aroma is fascinating and flawless and keeps drawing me back for more. Luckily, this makes an expressive, fragrant cocktail and is the first time ']"
246,Hyde No. 3 “The Áras Cask” 6 Year-old Irish Single Grain Whiskey ,"[': Vodka notes up front, suggesting a rest in the glass is needed. After a rest, there is still an industrial solvent off-note dominating the aroma.', ': Syrupy body. Meaty, with nutty toasted hazelnut. Low burn. That industrial off-note remains.', ': Medium-long. Permeated by grimy industrial oil. Finishes with walnut oil, burned sugar, and a bit of bitterness. Unpleasant.', ': A few drops of water elevate the vodka/acetone note without adding anything of value. Skip the water.', ': The overall impression I have is “unpleasant”. It doesn’t have too much of the young vodka/acetone notes one associates with young grain whiskey, but it’s dominated by a grimy, ugly note that hovers somewhere between burned sugar and rancid oil. In a word, unpleasant. Someone, somewhere, likes this flavor profile and would be happy to pay $50 for it. I’m not that person.']"
247,I.W. Harper Bourbon ,"[': First impression is of something weirdly vegetal – grassy… like trampled wet grass or freshly-turned compost. A rest in the glass reveals a heavy banana note, verging on rotting banana peel, which eventually resolves into banana sorbet. Not a great start.', ': Thin body. Pecans, black pepper, and more of that mushy banana. A little dull, and vaguely watery. A muddy blend of stale cornbread, plain white sugar (and not much of it), swampy oak, and spent coffee grounds.', ': Of medium length. Vague brown sugar, bitter barrel char, dry oaky tannins, and a fleeting grassy note, like spent sugarcane.', ': Several drops of water reveal a fresher sort of banana and perhaps a little dried coconut. The palate is brighter, but the finish is just as dull.', ': Eh. As mediocre a bourbon as I’ve had in a while. A confusing and off-putting aroma, bland and watery on the palate, and a forgettable finish. The cocktails I’ve made with it are uninteresting. This is a solid “Don’t Bother” in my book.']"
248,Isle of Jura (10 year) (43% Presentation) ,"[': Clean and crisp, with notes of green apple and fresh pears. Some sweet florals – honeysuckle – and a strong presence of green banana. Slightly grassy, like aloe vera. No peat in evidence.', ': Moderately creamy body, with an initial wave of vanilla, followed by freshly-mown grass, unripe fruit, aloe juice, and dry wood notes.', ': Short. Raw sugar cane, plus some slightly bitter wood tannins, which fade quickly into faint dry woodiness.', ': A few drops of water intensifies the green banana notes without contributing anything else. The palate, however, is markedly sweeter with notes of egg custard, vanilla pudding, and a thicker body. Water is probably a good idea with this.', ': A fairly standard ex-bourbon malt without much age on it. The vanilla and green fruits, grass, and disappointing finish are hallmarks of a not-quite-ready-yet malt from (possibly) refill bourbon casks. At around $40 a bottle, I would probably choose ']"
249,Isle of Jura (16 year) ,"[': Elegant citrus – grapefruit maybe, or ', ': Slightly chewy texture, and quite sweet. Candied orange peels, tawny fudge, blanched almonds, and marzipan. Not an ounce of burn on the tongue. Ladylike, even.', ': The heather notes return, with honey and a bit of oaky tannins. A final wave of very mild citrus – just pith, maybe – and a ghost of bitterness.', ': Several drops of water draw out a bit more of the eccentric aspects of the sherry, namely a leather note, and some lemon peel, which continues through the palate and finish as extra tartness. Water is not needed here, but does add something interesting.', ': An eminently likable malt. Flawless in execution, sweet and mild on the tongue, with a moderately perfumed aroma. This would be excellent with a mild cigar. Jura has a lot of ardent admirers, and I can see why. It is not intense nor challenging, but it is complex enough to reward contemplation.']"

251,J.H. Cutter Whiskey ,"[': Vaguely malty (from the Potrero malted rye), with hints of corn alongside malted milk balls, orange peel, cardamom, and rye spices. Lilacs and other florals, plus a very light fruity note like pear drops. A rest in the glass reveals more bourbon-like notes, with dark corn syrup and toasted oak.', ': Thin body. Moderate tongue burn, appropriate for 48% ABV. Tastes more like a lighter-style bourbon now, with corn-forward flavors, cherry syrup, spicy rye notes, and a welcome continuation of the pear drops from the aroma. Reminds me of some ', ': Medium length. Not bitter or tannic at all. The fruits persist, and a mouth-drying menthol note kicks in early. The maltiness comes back in the end, like vanilla marshmallows and frosted cereal. Pleasant.', ': The addition of a few drops of water initially mutes the aroma, requiring a rest in the glass. Even then, the only thing that wakes up is the nose tickle. Skip water here.', ': A very pleasant, subtle, perfumed, even dainty whiskey with a mixture of familiar and novel flavors. The port finish comes through in faint pear drops (I love that), while the two whiskies shift between rye spiciness and light corn sweetness, back and forth over the palate. I got a sweet deal for $34 which makes this an approachable experiment. Much above $45 and I wouldn’t feel like I had gotten my money’s worth. It is very young whisky, after all, although Anchor has done an excellent job masking the youth behind good old-fashioned flavor.']"
252,J.P. Wiser’s Canadian Rye Whisky ,"[': Toffee or butterscotch. The nose is fairly faint, which some might call “smooth” while others might call it “bland”. There is sweetness, but it has an artificial bent. Of rye, there is nary a sign.', ': Lightly sweet, and so “smooth” that there is neither much tongue burn nor much flavor. A faint cereal note, a manufactured caramel note, and.. that’s all, folks.', ': Short. A reprise of the palate, with still no hint of rye character. A slight chemical bitterness – like the residue on new plastic – forms the tail end of the finish.', ': At this ABV and lightness of character, water isn’t warranted. Indeed, adding it only heightened the artificial sweetness, now like bottled corn syrup.', ': It is perhaps not fair to rate this whisky neat. It was likely not intended to compete with single malt or straight bourbon. Still, with the word ‘rye’ on the label you’d expect a little spice or something. The sweet flavors are artificial, and the whisky flavors so light as to be ignorable. I suppose you could mix drinks with it, but unless you’re allergic to flavor, a similarly-priced bourbon is likely to give you more bang for your whiskey buck in any cocktail. It says “Quality is something you just can’t rush” on the bottle, which leads me to wonder if this whiskey was made in record time.']"

After a rest in the glass to disperse any aroma of adhesives, the nose is suggestive of rye but contains a lot of vanilla and heavy, syrupy sweetness. Somewhat cloying, like a heavily frosted cinnamon bun on a sweltering hot day. Also, banana bread, corn pudding, and a ghostly echo of that glue (think grade-school rubber cement).', ': Syrupy body. Rye bread up front, complete with toasted caraway seed, plus rye grain cinnamon and clove. The sweetness is suffusive, but not quite as cloying as suggested by the nose. It’s also not very nuanced – try to imagine eating a spoonful of white corn syrup out of the bottle.', ': Short. As soon as I swallow, the whisky’s character evaporates. There might be a whiff of vanilla and clove left behind.', ': I hesitate to add any water at all, but a few drops release an amped-up wave of bakery spices before settling back into cloying sugary-ness. The palate is unchanged, as is the finish. No water needed here.', ': I would have assumed that 18 years in oak would have at least added some oaky complexity or mellowed those weird glue notes into something nuanced. Tasted blind, I would have said this was American rye at 4 or 5 years of age that had been watered down to 30% ABV and had corn syrup added to it. None of that is true, but that is the impression left upon me by my three attempts to appreciate the “Tradition of Quality and Craftsmanship” promised by the label.']"

Green grass and crushed mint, orange zest, and root beer persist on the palate, and the whole is fully-flavored but dry (not very sweet).', ': Medium-short. The mint carries through, although the finish turns a little bitter. Bitter roots, mild charcoal, and very slight mouth-drying oak tannins. Fades quickly without evolving.', ': A few drops of water increase the nose tickle without adding any additional aromas. The palate becomes a bit woody (odd, that) and the finish displays more tannins, plus a rush of black licorice. Water optional.', ': It’s funny what a few small differences can mean for the overall recommendability (nope, still not a word) of a whiskey. The cask-strength rye suffered in my review for its middle-of-the-road character that didn’t quite live up to its $40 price tag. Drop the ABV a few percent (and much more importantly, drop the price $15), and I start calling it a very well put-together rye, if a touch on the young side. Luckily, those youthful notes are all of the grass/mint variety, and not in the “paint thinner” category. A solid rye for the price, and certainly a good choice for whiskey-based cocktails, but I still prefer ']"
256,James E. Pepper 1776 Barrel Proof Rye ,"[': A blast of rye favorites: cinnamon, clove, stale nutmeg, plus a hint of cherry and a wave of marzipan. Potent and concentrated, and not suggestive of young under-matured rye. ', ': Medium-bodied. Dry and super hot (duh). Dusty spices and bright-red maraschino cherries. Spiced cider and baked apples (very reminiscent, in fact, of ', ': Medium-long. Apples again, and the requisite spices, plus more black pepper. Drying, and nicely oaky. Fades with some charcoal and without bitterness, but it’s so dry that it seems a little unbalanced.', ': Several drops of water have little effect on the aroma. They also fail to dampen the tongue burn. A much larger splash does something interesting: a huge dose of cherry pie filling on the nose (almost sweet!), and a much softer grain-forward palate with more bakery (as opposed to dry spice cabinet) spices. The finish also has a little caramel on it. If you find this to be one-dimensional or overly dry at full strength, try proofing it down to 45% or so. It’s worth the effort.', ': This is exactly what I’d expect from a $40 mass-produced factory rye at cask strength: One-dimensional high-rye notes of spices, without a lot of sweetness or complexity to back it up. I tried it in a Manhattan and was mildly disappointed. The barrel proof kicks up a potent cocktail (which I like), but the dryness and peppery-ness fail to balance with the vermouth, and the spice notes are lost, or become dusty. The result is a dry, one-dimensional cocktail with power but no finesse.']"
257,James E. Pepper 1776 Bourbon ,"[': Needed some time to wake up after pouring from a fresh bottle. Although still very shy, the aroma reveals deep sugary fudge, cherry cordial, and a dark resinous furniture polish. Brooding, if I’m allowed to anthropomorphize.', ': Medium bodied. Tannic, with an eye-searing tongue burn up front. After wiping my eyes with as much manliness as I could muster… nope, still burning, hold on… “Small sips, man, c’mon… small sips.” Ok. Black forest cake (chocolate and cherries), fudge again, black walnut sawdust, drippy tree resin, and more furniture polish. Still brooding.', ': Of medium length. Cocoa powder (dry, dusty), drying barrel tannin but no charcoal bitterness. Fades without changing.', ': A hearty splash of water does little for the aroma, although it does dampen the tongue burn a bit. For that alone, try a little water (or even ice) with this one. The finish also picks up a little welcome herbaceousness – perhaps mint.', ': Woah. This is some serious-business bourbon. Deep, dark, sweet, and pungent, this blows the socks off of the ']"
258,Jefferson’s Very Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': Soft grains; fresh corn, with a sweet coconut-and-banana tone. Vanilla buttercream, with sugars verging on caramel. Very slight spiciness, more like cinnamon bun than the actual spice.', ': Medium-full body. Slightly hot. A bit of sugar cane appears, with its hint of vegetation, and an edge of charcoal. Oaky, with not as much sweetness as was promised on the aroma.', ': Medium-long. Some bitterness, oak tannin, and more charcoal. Fades with a bit of honey, like candy corn, and marzipan.', ': A few drops of water bring that green sugar cane note to the aroma, which becomes almost grassy. It also adds more vanilla but thins the palate. It’s a little less hot. This bourbon can handle a little water, but doesn’t need it.', ': A respectable, mid-range bourbon. There are more sweet notes promised to the nose than are delivered to the palate, but on the whole it’s well balanced and non-threatening. This would make a reasonable house bourbon (it’s slightly sweeter, slightly less vegetal, and slightly less complex than my usual go-to bourbon, ']"
259,Jim Beam “Pre-Prohibition Style” Rye ,"[': Grassy Beam character with a healthy dose of green apple, freshly-mown grass, and fresh corn kernels. The dominant note on the aroma is tart: that green apple almost turning into lime juice. There is very little of the expected rye profile: no cinnamon, no clove, and only a hint of anise. Still, there are no unpleasant notes, and no “paint thinner” or chemical smells.', ': Syrupy body. Hot, with an unpleasant amount of burn for a 90 proof whiskey. Burnt caramel, caramel apple, unroasted coffee beans, and (at last) a swath of bakery spices. Now it tastes like a rye, although the youthful grassy notes are still evident.', ': Medium-short. Tart again, with more apple and now candy-corn. This fades quickly, leaving apple skins, slightly bitter barrel char, and a touch of paint thinner.', ': Several drops of water make this smell even more like Beam: More grass. The water also adds a green banana / unripe coconut note to both the aroma and palate. The palate and finish also acquire a weird “fruit” punch or bubblegum flavor. Water is not necessary with this one, but won’t ruin anything either.', ': This is really not bad for $16 a bottle. If you forgive the young grassy notes, the faintness of the rye spices on the aroma, and the lackluster and kind-of unpleasant finish, you could do WAY worse for under $20 a bottle. I still prefer my old standbys ']"
260,Jim Beam Original (White Label) ,"[': Very sweet, with a pronounced bubble gum / fruit punch / tutti-frutti aroma. Neon maraschino cherries. Not shy, a good concentration on the nose, but not a lot of dimension (oak, corn, charcoal, nothin’). This imbalance only increases with a rest in the glass, showing even more fruit punch.', ': Medium bodied. Mild tongue burn. A lot of the aroma notes are present here – the fruit punch in particular. There is a layer of slight nuttiness (like peanut skins without the peanuts) and a hint of charcoal. Very little oak, and almost no caramelized sugars.', ': Short. Some marshmallow, and (of course) fruit punch. No tannins. Fades quickly with only a hint of bitterness. Forgettable.', ': A few drops of water change nothing on the aroma, but they add a “white sugar” note and associated sweetness on the palate. The finish is a little livelier, with some nuttiness added. Take or leave water as you like.', ': Look, it’s not bad. There, I said it. It’s just not as good as “The world’s No. 1 bourbon”, as the label claims, ought to be… but then the “World” doesn’t pick its “No. 1” based solely on taste. There are so many flavors that I associate with “bourbon” as a category – charcoal, burnt sugar, caramel, heavy oaky sweetness, etc., and none of those are in evidence with Jim Beam. It has a prominent fruity sweetness (which verges on the “fake” corn syrupy candy notes found in some cheap whiskies), and it indeed has 40% alcohol in it, by volume. That’s about it. Tasting blind, I’m not certain I’d be able to guess that it was even bourbon.']"
261,John Barr Reserve Blended Scotch ,"[': Very slight peat (more fungal than smoky), over a mildly sweet vanilla malt. Faint rock candy and a touch of caramel. Not obviously grainy.', ': Mildly syrupy body. Sweet and malt-forward, with loads of baked goods (scones), caramel, and a hint of black pepper. On the tongue the grain elements are revealed, with a twinge of young grain that comes across as glue (rubber cement).', ': An ugly twist of industrial solvent (acetone) ruins an otherwise middling experience. The whole of the finish is swallowed up in shudder-inducing paint thinner and charcoal. Blech.', ': A few drops of water muddle the aroma, releasing some nondescript fruit notes but confusing the rest. No real change on the palate or finish. I would avoid the water with this one. (Also avoid ice – it does NOT help.)', ': Apologies to the reader who suggested this one. It has a mild, promisingly inoffensive aroma and a middling palate marred by a very common (for this price-point) grain-whisky-induced glue (or vodka-like) note. The whole thing goes down the proverbial tubes on the finish, which is entirely overwhelmed by raw grain alcohol notes and acetone. One really shouldn’t expect very much from a $23 scotch, even one blended by legendary blender Richard Paterson, but a side-by-side comparison with ']"
262,Johnnie Walker Black Label (12 year) Blended Scotch ,"[': A light Highland peachiness (Dalwhinnie?). Pretty floral. Light and inoffensive. Totally unable to detect any peat. Deeper in, round and mildly buttery. Nary a hint of paint thinner!', ': Medium-bodied. Mild tongue burn – I guess that would be called ‘smooth’. Vanilla cake bread crumbs, a slight hint of smouldering match head, and a few seconds later, an acidic wave of vodka-esque off notes.', ': Slightly acrid, like a smear of coal tar on top of a buttered scone. Fading out with some almond paste, and only a little bitter woodiness. On the short side.', ': Elevated florals, and a hint of peach pit on the nose. Shortbread and crumb cake on the slightly thinner palate. A nice woody marshmallow and some caramel on the finish. This is quite improved by the addition of a splash of water.', ': Ok, fine, it’s really not that bad. It has some nice floral elements in the nose, a straightforward flavor, and not too much bitterness on the finish. That said, it has two major downsides: ']"
263,Johnnie Walker Green Label (15-year) ,"[': Light and fruity, with white peach, honey, fresh malty grains, and graham cracker. Some floral notes are present, but hard to pin down – probably from the peated components. Let’s call it gorse because that makes it sound like I know what I’m talking about.', ': Soft and slightly syrupy on the palate. Little tongue burn. Malty cereal notes dominate, with a tinge of oat bran. Some of the notes from the aroma are present (honey, particularly), but not much fruit. The honey is multi-dimensional, the rest is not.', ': Short. Slightly bitter barrel char initially, which is joined by vague nougaty nuttiness. Fades quickly with a whimper.', ': A few drops of water release a splash of green apple and unripe banana. The palate is a little spicier and more vibrant, as is the finish. I highly recommend a few sparse drops of water with this one.', ': Perspective is an odd thing. Had I just cracked open a bottle of single malt from some barely-known “craft” distillery after getting a good deal on the bottle, I would have probably rejoiced at having found a hidden gem with a polished and accomplished (if a little boring) presentation and a fabulous price point. Since this is the ubiquitous Johnnie Walker, however, my brain says “eh, it’s just OK.” Brain be damned, this is a very drinkable, very available, and very well-priced dram. It’s all-malt, and it has an age statement to boot. Being picky, I have to point out that the palate doesn’t offer much of a surprise, the finish is forgettable, and the peated components are nearly invisible… but we’re talking about 15 year-old malt for under $50 here.']"
264,Johnnie Walker Island Green ,"[': Mild peat – dark wet soil – with only a touch of smolder. Hot coals. Mildly sweet malt, with sooty cereals and only a very little bit of a floral note (rosewater, maybe). Delicate, but unmistakably peat-forward.', ': Medium body. First impression is of vanilla cream soda and then a wave of peat crashes, turning smoky and earthy. Extremely mild tongue burn.', ': Medium-long. A twinge of honey sets in adding much-needed sweetness, and the charcoal notes turn slightly bitter. Fades slowly, without evolving.', ': A few drops of water result in a spike of tart aromas (tropical fruit), while taming the peat. These carry through to the finish. This changes a lot – I suggest trying it first without the water, and then adding a little to see how it changes for you.', ': A very successful peated blend(ed malt). Usually blends with peat elements go one of two ways: Horribly bitter and acrid, or exclusively peat-dominated. Island Green manages to straddle the line, with enough peat character to remain solidly in the “peated” category, while retaining a good balance of malty character and (albeit slight) Highland notes. Quite drinkable.']"
265,Johnnie Walker Platinum Label (18-year) Blended Scotch ,"[': Gently perfumed, apple blossoms, white tea, ginger, juicy pears, and an undercurrent of fresh banana. This smells more like a carefully-crafted perfume than a scotch whisky. The effect is light, with no nose tickle and only very faint oak or malt notes. One could be forgiven for thinking this was a pear eau de vie by the aroma alone. After a rest in the glass, most of those volatile aromas escape, leaving a heavy banana custard note.', ': Medium bodied, almost syrupy. Slight tongue burn. A bit of bitter barrel char arrives upfront, which is off-putting. The banana reasserts itself, along with assorted fruit notes. The oaky bitterness persists. There are some flavors of bakery sweets – banana cream pie comes to mind, as do buttered scones. The whole is marred by that weird tannic charry bitter note, however.', ': Short. Charcoal, apple skins, and a fading nutty bitterness, like scorched almonds. There is a marzipan note on the tail end of the finish.', ': Several drops of water reawaken the volatile esters in the aroma, including the flowers and fruits. The palate becomes somewhat sweeter – like vanilla crème brûlée – but the bitter note remains. There is more sparkle on the finish, which seems a little longer. This clearly benefits from the addition of a little water. (But not too much at 40% ABV!) ', ': I expected a bit more surface-level quality from a premium Diageo product – usually their whiskies (especially those with age statements) are more polished than this, and simply lack depth or complexity. Instead, this tastes like the kind of leftover barrel of no-name malt that the independent bottlers pass over and which ends up in a grocery store label bottling. In fact, the grain whisky in this blend is (I suspect) what elevates it, giving it that syrupy body and some of the lighter fruit-and-flowers notes. It wasn’t until after the fact (I taste whiskies before reading about them, when possible) that I realized all that bitter charcoal was actually supposed to be smoky Islay peat, which appears to have been lost in translation. I will admit that the whisky has a delicate aroma with an excellent perfumed balance of fruits and flowers, and I could certainly pass the time just smelling this whisky. I just didn’t enjoy anything that came after.']"
266,Johnnie Walker Rye Cask Finish (10 year) ,"[': Wakes up a little hot – a few minutes in the glass settle the alcohol and allow for a deeper nosing. A nice, round grain-forward profile including breakfast cereal and toasted whole grain bread, coconut shavings and molasses. There’s a lot more oaky sweetness (as opposed to malty sweetness) than one usually finds in a blended scotch.', ': Soft and syrupy. Moderate tongue burn, which finally recedes into a heavy coconut (like ', ': Medium-long. Drying, with some oaky tannins but a larger emphasis on caramel and – dare I say it? Pumpkin spice latte. Fades with a black coffee-like bitterness, the one disappointment.', ': Aroma seems unchanged by a few drops of water. The effect on the palate is calmer, and brings a touch more sweetness. Water is optional with this one, but with the “roughness” of the alcohol bite, you might consider proofing it down slightly.', ': An interesting, and successful, blending of the “sweet and syrupy” effect of Scottish grain whisky with the robust flavor of malt whisky, and the spicy/oaky character of those two quintessential American whiskeys: bourbon and rye. While most scotch is aged in ex-bourbon casks, the first-fill casks chosen for this blend are very prominent in the final product and deliver a wallop of coconut. The finishing in rye casks was equally successful, with a sparkling spiciness on the tongue which integrates nicely with the other components. The only down marks come from the splintered finish, which starts out promising “pumpkin spice latte” and then goes full “bitter black coffee”. At $45, a reasonable choice. At $30, a steal, and a Must Try.']"
267,Johnny Drum Private Stock Bourbon ,"[': Sappy, with a lot of corn syrup elements. Hint of cherry. Deeper in the glass there are some molasses and caramelized sugar notes. Overall, the aroma is shy and dry.', ': Medium bodied. The initial wave of cherry juice is followed by an appreciable tongue burn. After, there are barrel tannins and a deep roasted hazelnut flavor. Still dry, but with more depth than was suggested by the nose. ', ': Medium-long. Cherry-flecked, corn syrup (cheap pancake syrup) with very minimal charcoal bitterness. Fades without evolving.', ': Several drops of water bring a tart cherry top note to the aroma and brings out a bark-y, root-beer note on the palate. Worth experimenting with a little water on this one. And, for what it’s worth, it makes a perfectly passable Old Fashioned.', ': Other than that surprising hazelnut note in the middle of the palate, there isn’t much to be excited about here. The nose is reticent and the flavor profile – while well-balanced and with good depth – is dry and lacks robustness. For the price, I’d far rather have ']"
268,Jura Superstition ,"[': Strong, iodine-flecked peat. Briny and heavily suggestive of the sea (not smoke). Reminds me of expanses of brown seaweed slowly aging (rotting) on a sea spray-buffeted beach. After a rest in the glass, one can pick out notes of sandalwood, vanilla, and caramel, although they are faint.', ': Moderately creamy body. Some tongue burn is followed by salty peat with notes of black pepper. A light malt sweetness pervades, but is just sweet enough to balance the salt/peat.', ': Of medium length. More of the same notes (salty peat). A hint of citrus creeps in as the peat fades, along with sweet Key lime. Pleasant.', ': A few drops of water temper the peat, releasing notes of salted caramel and vanilla. The same notes appear on the tongue, improving the overall balance of the malt (unless you just love seaweed).', ': First, I ', ' recommend water with this. Water turns a one-dimensional oceanic peat show into a well-balanced orchestra of peat and oak and caramelized malt. Quite tasty, and more accessible (especially with water) than other peated standards like ']"
269,Kaiyō Japanese Mizunara Oak ,"[': Rotting wood, wet moss, engine grease, burnt caramel without the sweetness. A rest in the glass does not improve the situation. There isn’t even the barest hint of sandalwood, but if you’re a fan of noxious incense that smells like burning rubber then yes, this probably smells like incense.', ': Medium body. Mild tongue burn (hotter than expected for 43% ABV). This tastes very much like bottom-shelf cheap blended Scotch whisky, with a top note of burning tires and acetone.', ': Unmercifully long. The primary flavor is vodka, the cheap kind. This is awful.', ': A few drops of water amp up the nose tickle, but fix nothing. A rest in the glass, however, adds a perfumed floral note that is welcome, but cannot by itself save this whisky. If you are cursed with a bottle of this and cannot give it away, I suggest waiting until you are good and drunk already, adding a small splash of water to a glass, letting it sit for 5 to 10 minutes, and then attempting to enjoy it.', ': Oh God I wanted to like this, I really did. I gave it several tastings spread across several weeks in the hope that it would grow on me. It didn’t. It’s vile. It bears no resemblance to my (admittedly distant) memory of Mizunara oak. It contains no notes that even come close to sandalwood. It tastes exactly like I would expect a grocery-store label of $10/liter blended scotch to taste, if it had been contaminated by motor oil. Without a doubt the worst use of $70 ever. I finally managed to rid myself of the bottle by hand-blending it with some leftover peated single malt scotch, which covered up some of the worst offenses.']"
270,Kentucky Owl Straight Rye (11 year) ,"[': Delectable. Deep, resinous notes of stewed pears, fresh apple cider, balsamic vinegar, dripping pine sap, oaky sugars, raw cacao, and mace (the spice, not the self-defense spray). A rest in the glass collects dense caramel and toffee notes. This is one of those bouquets that keeps on giving – every time you pick up the glass you are struck by something different.', ': Thin body. Woodsy, like hemlock forests or redwood needles crushing underfoot. A current of maraschino cherries washes through right before a wave of cinnamon red-hots and numbing tongue burn wash it away. Despite the high ABV, the tongue burn is only moderate. Less complex than the aroma, but still deep and intense, spicy and dry.', ': Long. Black cherries, wood varnish, concentrated resinous wood sugars (balsamico again). A moderate amount of barrel char without the bitterness, and a fading note of fresh cranberry. Dry, overall, and not quite as successful as the aroma.', ': Several drops of water mute the aroma somewhat, increasing the impression of dryness. There is added meatiness or nuttiness on the tongue, like roasted chestnuts, and the finish is fuller and rounder. Try this first without water, and then with… but only a little bit.', ': Despite the slightly disappointing finish, this is what I look for in a well-aged rye. Concentrated oak, woodsy pine or eucalyptus, jammy stone fruits, and unusual spices. Deep, contemplative, and powerful. If only it wasn’t so limited and so damn expensive. I’d be excited to buy this for $80 a bottle. $140? I don’t think so. Still, I challenge you to find a 10-year or older rye at a reasonable proof that isn’t wildly overpriced. There just isn’t much of the stuff to go around. If the price tag doesn’t scare you off, it’s tasty juice. For that reason I’m giving this a “Recommended” rating. If there were other old ryes available for less money, that would be a different story.']"
271,Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey ,"[': Clean scent. Very grain-y, with the usual lineup of cereals, powdered sugar, and freshly-baked bread. While not particularly hot at the baseline 40% ABV, there is a pronounced nose tickle. Some high notes appear: raspberry? green apple? But they are transient.', ': Thin body, with only a hint of pot-still bulk. Tongue burn is minimal, although it lasts for awhile. Not much in the way of flavor is revealed: a repeat of the cereal notes and that slightly unpleasant “wide-cut” effect: vaguely reminiscent of the scent of turpentine.', ': Medium-length. Green apple again, and a slight woody nuttiness. Not unpleasant for an inexpensive whiskey, but there are no stand-out flavors.', ': A generous splash of water reveals a nice banana taffy tang on the nose, with heightened vanilla notes. The body is unaffected, and is considerably smoother (no surprise there, it’s diluted), but is somehow also more soft and no longer has that vodka/turpentine quality. The banana taffy is repeated on the finish. I heartily recommend dosing this with a little water.', ': This, like Jameson, is an eminently drinkable Irish whiskey. I feel that Jameson has a little more to offer in the way of fruit notes and character. For my money (and especially if I’m drinking it straight), I’ll stick to Jameson. I am, however, excited to try the whiskey now being produced at the rejuvenated original distillery. The “Not Recommended” rating is due to the minimal flavor, and the fact that Jameson is probably a better buy.']"
272,Kilchoman 100% Islay 3rd Edition ,"[': Elegantly smoky, elements of brushfire and straight wood smoke. A hint of roasting meats, but otherwise very clean, lean and smoke-centric. There’s also a stark minerality, like the smell of sparkling mineral water.', ': Soft. Even at 100 proof, the tongue burn is only moderate. Delicate strands of oatmeal, sea brine, and fresh, ripe barley. The grain (normally a bad word) element is pure and is only the second time I’ve ever thought of barley in terms of terroir (the other was Bruichladdich Bere Barley).', ': Long. A surprisingly sweet wave of barley. Still exceedingly clean and lithe. Finishes with vanilla-tinged woodsmoke, and no bitterness.', ': A splash of water gives the nose more sweetness, which pairs well with the woodsmoke. The palate is a little washed out, but the finish is unchanged. I think I prefer this with the water.', ': While this lacks some of the depth and roundness of the ']"
273,Kilchoman 2007 Vintage ,"[': A distinct grassy, vegetal aroma – new make – greets the nose at first. Celery salt, mown grass, etc. The usual Islay smoke is subdued, but present.', ': Thin body, but a nice agave-like sweetness pervades. Little to no tongue burn (amazing for 46% ABV at this young age). The smoke (wood smoke, and grass) is in the background, and elements of (very good) tequila keep coming to the front, with nopales, vanilla, and slight buttery oak.', ': Medium-long. The smoke becomes more of a factor, and the “new make” character is gone. A little meaty, a little nutty, and something briny. Altogether light, but crisp.', ': If anything, the water accentuates the tequila/cactus notes. It adds a little sweetness and vanilla on the palate, and finishes with a little more nuttiness to the smoke. Still, I’d consider water optional with this one.', ': This release has a lot more “new make” in it than something like the ']"
274,Kilchoman Machir Bay ,"[': The first impression is of unmistakably Islay peat and white chocolate. Faint florals -lavender?- twine with the lemony, slightly acidic peat. Not particularly smoky or earthy, but ethereal and vegetal. Like a pile of freshly-mown hay and flowers just starting to smoulder. The heat of its 46% ABV is detectable, but not offensive. Decidedly subtle, for a fully peated malt. After a rest in the glass, I can detect juicy peach, which might come from the ever-so-brief sherry finish.', ': Thin body. Lemon in waves upfront, with a background of vanilla frosting. After the slight (very slight!) burn subsides, there are ample waves of grain (hehehe), a faint layer of fresh strawberries and fruit punch, and a continuous high note of (hay) peat.', ': Long. Somehow avoids being bitter, despite all the phenol. A moment of lavender honey, followed by dry bark, lemon peel oil, and spent charcoal.', ': A few drops of water cause the peat to begin smoking. Tobacco, freshly-squeezed lemon juice, and crushed mint. The palate is much sweeter, with crumbly snickerdoodle cookies, vanilla extract, and banana cream pie. This malt is undeniably improved by the addition of water!', ': Subtle and accomplished, if light. The peat is masterfully understated, and plays beautifully with the naturally sweet lemon, honey, and floral elements. Don’t let the ‘light’ moniker distract from the fact that this is very highly peated malt, with far more subtlety than, say, Laphroaig, but a lot more power and sinus-burning peat than Highland Park. It does very much stand alone among the Islay malts, though, being light and playful, but also masterful and persuasive. Very impressive for a malt with an average age significantly under 5 years. I’ve made this a “Must Have” whisky for peat-lovers: you can’t miss the revolution in Islay whiskies, and now you don’t have to pay charity prices for it!']"
275,Kilchoman Sanaig ,"[': Black pepper, charcoal, strong woodsy peat. Deeper in, there are persistent notes of chalk, lime peel, ozone and seltzer. Initially, I had trouble identifying any sherry notes at all. After a rest in the glass, there are some jammy berry flavors.', ': Thin body. Not too much tongue burn. Elegant, with wisps of campfire smoke, fresh-cracked grains, and refined sugar. Again, it took a few tries to identify the sherry character, which is similar to the aroma.', ': Long. Bordering on savory, like fire-charred seafood with a spritz of lime juice. Dried berries, cocoa powder. Ends with dry peat and mouth-drying oak tannins.', ': A few drops of water initially dampen the aroma, but give it a few minutes and there’s kefir lime and shortbread cookies. The finish also becomes more sparkling and is slightly tart.', ': An elegant, if straightforward peated malt with an odd sense of sherry being totally in the background. It’s not quite as exciting to me as the ']"

277,Kirkland Highland Sherry Cask Finish – 18 year ,"[': Very Floral. Elderflower, dilute cranberry juice, a hint of candle wax. Orange-blossom honey, and a note of heather that reminds me of some of the ex-bourbon-cask Balvenies. Elegant, slightly tart, and with excellent florals. On the lighter side (for a sherried malt), but quite surprisingly nice.', ': Somewhat waxy. Tart, fruity notes of fresh berries. Vanilla pound cake, some blonde fudge. A bit one-dimensional, but pleasant.', ': The slightest peat, mossy and a little herbal. this fades into hazelnut butter and echoes of the berries from earlier. Absolutely without bitterness.', ': A few drops of water yield a little stonefruit and a little more maltiness. Really, this is already watered to its limit and doesn’t need any more, especially with the already-present florals on the nose.', ': This is a fabulous malt for $38. Tasted blind, I’d have said it was worth at least $60, and these days an age statement of 18 will net you a minimum of $100. Well done, Alexander Murray. Well done. I could wish for a little higher ABV to provide some bite, but for straight sipping, this is correctly watered.']"
278,Kirkland Small Batch Bourbon – 7 year ,"[': Light brown sugar, a bare hint of acetone (nail polish remover), which reminds me instantly of Jim Beam. Less oak and less caramel than comparable bourbons. No detectable cherry element. Some raw corn and light corn syrup candies (caramel corn). The alcohol is somewhat biting.', ': A little syrupy, but with a rough tongue burn. Some astringency but without the woody flavors that come with older bourbon. Now there’s a bit of cherry (lozenge) and some hay notes. Still light on the sugar (no molasses) and rough on the palate.', ': Medium long. A little oak and more caramel corn. Forgettable.', ': A few drops of water don’t do anything to elevate the aroma, perhaps instead accentuating the nail polish remover. If you’re drinking this neat, water isn’t going to make much difference, except perhaps by proofing it down to tame the burn.', ': Unlike most Kirkland labelled booze, I’m severely underwhelmed by this one. It’s obviously Jim Beam, but I don’t think it comes from the recipe used to make Knob Creek (which was my hope) and instead seems to be slightly younger Jim Beam Black. I would not recommend this for drinking neat. It makes a passable cocktail (and $20 a liter isn’t a bad price), but you’d do much (much) better with a bottle of Knob Creek Small Batch, which is superior in basically every way. If you’re a Jim Beam lover, though, and looking for a value bottle, this should suit.']"

Aroma notes continue to the palate – cherry lozenge, prune, caramel or butterscotch. A nice maltiness emerges after a few seconds, a reminder of barley grains.', ': A nice woody twist, echoes of the black fruits with some final wisps of mint and slightly acrid smoke, like an extinguished cigar. Mild bitterness.', ': A few drops of water makes the nose very brambly – blackberry leaves and nettle. Increased burn on the palate, and amped-up smoke on the finish. I’d skip the water here.', ': This actually bears more resemblance to ']"
280,Kirkland Speyside Sherry Cask Finish – 20 year ,"[': Unmistakable sherry. Some bright red fruits – currant – on top of a deep, nutty layer of well-rounded malt. By God, this smells like Macallan. There is a distinct lack of rancio, leather, or other telling characteristics of long-term sherry maturation, which is consistent with the idea that the malt was in ex-bourbon (or perhaps reconditioned refill sherry casks) for the lion’s share of its age. That makes it pointless to compare to Macallan’s official bottling range, so drinkers of The Macallan 18 will be disappointed to find this isn’t “as good”. However, from the nose alone this seems like an excellent malt in its own right. The bright, fresh red fruits pop, and the mature malt provides a nutty and not overly-sweet backdrop.', ': On the tame side. The fruit here is dried, and somewhat dusty, and there are hints of tobacco, white pepper, and sappy oak. It just doesn’t go anywhere.', ': Medium-short. Fruit jam up front, fading into walnut meats, fruitcake, and fig paste. A tinge of charcoal and faint oak tannin – not quite bitter. This doesn’t linger like a GlenDronach or an OB Macallan, but it is straightforward, pleasant, and inoffensive.', ': A few drops of water don’t seem to me to make much difference. At 40%, this doesn’t need any further dilution.', ': My personal theory is that because this is a malt matured in non-sherry for 20 years and then finished in sherry, The Macallan did not want to tarnish their brand image by allowing Kirkland to name the distillery on the bottle and confuse drinkers accustomed to Macallan’s all-sherry, all-the-time house style. If you associate old sherried malts with notes of leather, rancio, resin, and concentrated fruit reductions (like I do), you will be hard-pressed to reconcile the flavors here – excellent though they might be – with the phrases “sherry cask” and “aged 20 years” on the bottle. It might be more helpful to think of this as a 20 year-old ex-bourbon Speysider with a top-dressing of sherry finish, à la Glenmorangie’s Lasanta.', ' $60.']"
281,Kirkland Speyside Sherry Cask Finish – 20 year (2018) ,"[': Distinct dried fruit notes – fig, dried berries, fruitcake, etc. – overlay a musky, meaty (but not quite sulfurous) layer of malt. Caramel apple and hints of cocoa (stopping short of actual chocolate) complete the picture. This is somewhat limited in scope, but not objectionable, and the sherry is clear and present.', ': Slightly syrupy body. The same fruits start things out, followed by a hotter-than-expected tongue burn for 46% ABV. ', ': Dried figs again, and drying red-wine tannins. Mildly bitter, and vague. Fades out with aromatic cocktail bitters (gentian) and anise.', ': A few drops of water appears to make a mess of the dried fruits – making some fresh and hiding the rest. Cherry, I think? The tongue burn does appear to be lessened, and the water adds a note of cinnamon. OK, I guess. Add the water only if you find the tongue burn annoying.', ': Not exactly a competitor for ']"
282,Knob Creek Single Barrel Bourbon (9 year) ,"[': Heavily oaky notes of resin, wood stain, and furniture polish. Dark, highly caramelized sugars (burnt caramel), and a deep cherry syrup note, like the liquid/sludge in a jar of real maraschino cherries. Orange peel rounds out the profile. After a rest in the glass, the profile becomes sweeter and rounder, with a vanilla buttercream frosting element.', ': Medium body, almost syrupy. Intense unholy tongue burn… ouch… no really my tongue is on fire! After feeling returns to the extremities and the sweat recedes, the flavors largely mirror the notes from the aroma: cherry, burnt caramel, oak furniture polish. I don’t think I have the literary talent to describe this, but if I were to lick an antique wooden desk so hard that the finish came off, I believe it would taste something like this. Having never done so, I can only speculate.', ': Medium-short. A nice orange oil note persists after swallowing. Very little bitterness or tannin despite all the oak. Some charcoal flavors remain as it fades.', ': Several drops of water release a vegetal/grassy note in the aroma, without substantially decreasing the tongue burn. Ouch again. There may be a bit more nuttiness on the finish (hazelnuts?). Water is optional here.', ': First of all, at 60% ABV this is the kind of thing that can strip paint. I can only imagine the number of taste bud cells that sacrificed themselves to the cause of reviewing this whiskey. Severely woody, with deeply oaky notes and a heavy barrage of burned sugar notes, this appeals to a very specific bourbon consumer. If you don’t care about fruity notes, you aren’t interested in the interplay of spice notes with delicate oak-derived sugars, and you really just want something you could fill a kerosene lamp with… this stuff will fit the bill. Otherwise, it’s a little one-dimensional. For my money, I’d rather have the ']"
283,Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon (9 year) ,"[': Deeply caramelized sugar, heavy oak, molasses, and a maraschino cherry on top. This definitely benefits from a rest in the glass – the notes meld better and mellow. Now I get a little rye eucalyptus and pine sap, and some gentler malt and marshmallow notes.', ': Well rounded, with a spike of cherry tartness. Not cloyingly sweet, but barrel sugars and corn sweetness are evident. Still heavy on the wood, but the effect is bracing rather than astringent.', ': Long. A little of the pine sap comes back, along with corn-syrup candies (caramel corn), and a little drying wood tannin and some barbeque char. Little to no bitterness.', ': At 100 proof, this is intended to be mixed with something (water, ice, or vermouth and bitters). A few drops of water are effective at rounding off the edges and smoothing out the whole operation. I don’t detect any additional aromas or flavors, but the water doesn’t hurt, and does tame the burn.', ': A pleasant, forthright bourbon. It is oaked right up to the maximum of effectiveness (any more would be like chewing on bark), and delivers standard bourbon flavors with balance and without any off notes. Cheap enough (and the right ABV) for mixing, widely available, and robust enough to enjoy by the glass. You could certainly do worse than this for a house bourbon. Some of my best Manhattans and Old Fashioneds were made with Knob Creek.']"
284,Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon (9 year) Revisited ,"[': Leather (or maybe leather conditioning products…), unsalted peanuts, corn syrup, and light brown sugar. The nose tickle is prominent, but the aromas are tame. There is definitely a faint Beam-esque vegetal/grassy note, which (along with the peanut / peanut shell aroma) grows as the whiskey rests in the glass.', ': Thin body. Slightly bitter barrel char and mildly sweet corn syrup hits the tongue first. After a moderate tongue burn there is cinnamon red-hot candies, bitter charcoal, and dry astringent oak.', ': Medium length. Even drier than the palate. The wood and charcoal remain, but little else. Fades without evolving.', ': A few drops of water reveal a circus peanut aroma (which is actually banana-flavored candy). The palate also becomes a little livelier. Water is fully optional here.', ': A very middle-of-the-road bourbon which verges on dryness. It has the Beam ']"
285,Knob Creek Small Batch Rye ,"[': Soft grains and high notes of clove, anise (black licorice), and cinnamon extract (cinnamon candy). The aroma is not unlike the inside of an old-time candy shop. Despite all the sugar references, the aroma is not altogether sweet, but rather reminiscent of the extracts and spices that make those candies memorable. Unlike other young ryes, there isn’t much menthol, eucalyptus, or mint. Deep in the glass there’s a stirring of caraway and camphor.', ': Spicy at first, bursting with cinnamon, then cooling off into straightforward cereal notes, dusty spice cabinet, and Good & Plenty’s (there’s that candy again).', ': Short. The spices return, but tempered with dried apple, caramel, and a beery malt. The finish falls off quickly, but is never bitter.', ': Water amplifies the spice at the expense of balance, although the aroma is sweeter. Unless the water is frozen and accompanies vermouth and bitters, I’d skip it.', ': For me, Knob Creek Rye sits squarely in the middle of the available (read: young) ryes currently available. It avoids the “spicy to a fault” armies of LDI/MGP rye clones with a nice balance of rye spiciness against warm, sweet cereal notes. However, it doesn’t show any of the bright minty notes of craft ryes, nor the deep earthy sweetness of ']"
286,Koval Single Barrel Millet Whiskey ,"[': Spicy. Eucalyptus and pine resin (like young rye), flecked with mace, raspberry leaves, black tea, and lemon peel. Mild oak. Unusual, although it would be easy to dismiss this as young rye at first smell.', ': Medium bodied. Sweet on the tongue, with a lot of wood sugars and vegetal honey. More rye-like spice notes, including clove, cinnamon, and pine resin.', ': Medium-long. Marshmallow and cinnamon rolls. Reprise of the palate notes, which fade with a little mouth-drying mint/menthol.', ': A few drops of water increase the pine notes, and thins the flavors on the finish. I wouldn’t use water with this.', ': Reminds me of ']"
287,Kyrö Verso Rye ,"[': Very gin-y. Strong, unappealing genever notes of heavily malted rye, juniper, Pine-Sol cleaner, and moonshine. It seems the heart cut on this was very wide, and picked up a lot of soapy, piney, medicinal notes. Reminds me a lot of ', ': Thin body. Bright and tart, with gingersnap cookies, lemon peel, a malty sweetness, and an unfortunate reprise of the gin notes from the aroma. Still, the palate is much better balanced and much tastier than the aroma promised.', ': Medium-long. Candied ginger, cinnamon taffy, black pepper. Not bitter, and thankfully not reminiscent of gin.', ': Water, if anything, accentuates the gin notes. Skip it.', ': Not my cup of tea. The aroma grabs me by the nose and screams “GIN”, and not nice, clean, crisp London dry gin either, but the soapy bathtub-style malty gin sold today as genever. Luckily, the palate and especially the finish redeem it, with a tasty balance of sweet spiced baked goods and a nice ginger note. A rollercoaster, but not one I’d pay to ride again. Especially not at those prices.']"

Smoky as all get-out. Not much wood, but a little smoked fish.', ': Sweet finally. Nice oatmeal, covered by a thick layer of smoke. Finishes with sea salt. No bitterness.', ': Reveals… banana? on the nose, which dissipates quickly. Campfire notes are subdued. The water adds in banana taffy, and a rummy kind of cane sugar in the nose. Perks up the palate.', ': The 12 has a clearer, cleaner flavor than Lagavulin 16, more bright and more powerful – lean and stripped-down. It shows Islay peat, pure and without excess wood or the sweetness inherent in the use of European oak. I think buying Lagavulin 12 is like spending top dollar for scratchy bootleg live recordings of a favorite artist. It’s an interesting case study in the variations present in the whisky due to changes in maturation (less age – thus less oak – and no sherry), but only Lagavulin devotees should consider paying the premium for the experience.']"

290,Lagavulin (8 year) ,"[': A pungent nose missile straight to the olfactory centers of the brain. BOOM piercing peat with unmistakable Lagavulin character. A blossom of salted caramel, honeysuckle, fresh hay, and refined, clarified, condensed ocean-flecked peat. Be careful with the nose tickle – it is sharp much deeper than the rim of the glass.', ': Soft, medium body. Sweet and gentle initially, lulling you, but the lull is suddenly shattered by a wave of tongue burn. This is over mercifully quickly (amazing for a young malt at 48%), scattering wet leaves, mushroomy peat, sea spray, sparkling minerality, and caramel across the tongue in equal proportion.', ': Long. Begins with a slight pale oakiness, then adds a layer of sooty (but not very bitter) charcoal. The peat and other notes are distant, now, and the party seems to be over quickly. The finish continues, but with mostly dry wood and dry coal.', ': Several drops of water actually amplify the nose tickle. There might be an additional orange-peel note on the nose, but it is fleeting. On the tongue I find a little more vanilla sweetness, although the texture is thinner. The finish does pick up a perfume high-note, jasmine maybe. Try both without and then with water.', ': More’s the pity, I don’t have a sample of ']"
291,Lagavulin (9 year) – Game of Thrones “House Lannister” ,"[': Raw, fungal, cidery peat. Astringent (make that cider vinegar), and only mildly smoky (think wet peat moss instead of peat fire). Aside from the peat, it’s a little shy and requires a short rest in the glass. Now I get raspberries (might be a first, that one!), sweet cream, shortbread cookie, toffee, and molasses (or treacle, if you’re British).', ': Silky body. Charcoal-flecked peat up front, now with wisps of smoke. These overtake most of the subtler notes. The tongue burn is minimal.', ': Long (duh). The peat and smoke persist, joined now by marzipan, raspberry taffy, and charcoal. There is no bitterness – amazing. Fades sedately, but without any new notes.', ': Several drops of water bring out more sooty fungal notes on the aroma and increase the smoke. Palate seems thinner, and a little more feinty (vodka-esque). It does add a curious minty/tobacco note on the finish, but I would skip water here. It just doesn’t need it and I’m not a fan of those extra sooty notes.', ': A very nice little Lagavulin. Anyone harboring hopes that this might be a way to buy the ']"

Green sap, with a hint of banana?', ': Clearly sherried, with lots of concentrated dark fruits, but now the peat I was missing in the nose comes through with nice balance. Smooth!', ': Overly sweet, with the usual cast of sherry characters. The peat gets somewhat lost.', ': A drop of water reveals a sulfury reek of banana peel, which dissipates, but not before I resolve to avoid the water with this one.', ': Okay. Yeah, it’s aged in PX sherry, which is a big deal, but… this particular expression falls short with me. The palate has a nice balance of fruit and smoke, but the sherry overwhelms the traditional Lagavulin character (which I would have said was hard to do) on the nose and finish. Also, despite the extra time in barrel, there’s not a lot of wood character. I’d stick to the 16, and get my sherry kick elsewhere. I’ll probably get some flack for this one, since lots of people love it. I’m a big fan of Lagavulin, but this DE just didn’t resonate with me.']"

At 57.8% ABV, it will crawl right up your nose if you get too close. Meat notes dance around the edge – like the charbroiled crust of a well-salted steak. Powerful and lean.', ': At full proof, this stuff will take a layer of skin off of your tongue, and pour saltwater in the wound. Once your tongue gets good and numb from the punishment, you can taste, finally, the malty sweetness hidden beneath that fiery inferno of peat smoke.', ': Super long. Meaty again, with crusty barbecued meat (minus the bbq sauce), smoldering campfire embers, and crispy dried seaweed (nori). Fades (amazingly) without bitterness. A welcome respite from the torrent of flame.', ': A healthy splash of water is almost required, as the malt is barely drinkable neat. Try to aim for a robust 50% ABV. At this point, the nose is more correctly balanced between woodsmoke, salt, and sweet cereals. Vanilla saltwater taffy emerges, and the finish acquires something minty. At even further dilution, look for some very faint fruit notes – strawberry or raspberry, and a more mossy, subdued peat.', ': I only have a sample here, but if I had a full bottle I might view it as an Everest in my cabinet. I would rarely be in the mood to hike its treacherous peaks, but once in awhile the manly urge to conquer might rise in my chest and I might crack open the bottle to brave the frostbite and possible loss of life or limb that waits inside. Seriously though, this is a challenging whisky that should only be attempted once a healthy respect for both heavily peated Islay (try ']"

There’s a lot more oakiness, and more oaky sweetness, than the standard ', ': Thin body. Moderate tongue burn (appropriate for something at nearly 50% ABV) is accompanied by mild oak, vanilla-flecked smoke, and the full gamut of iodine-and-seaweed Laphroaig peat.', ': Very long. You can usually taste Laphroaig the following day, so that’s not news. The extra European oak notes do translate to the finish, which has some cinnamon and vanilla to accompany the ever-present maritime peat.', ': A few drops of water ‘warm’ up the aroma a bit, bringing the cinnamon notes to the front, along with a dose of caramel. Try this without water first, and then add a little to see how it changes for you.', ': I’m impressed that in a side-by-side comparison, it’s clear that this is Laphroaig “plus”. You get extra cinnamon, extra vanilla, and extra oaky sweetness from the European oak that’s just simply missing from the standard expression. It does not taste more mature, nor mellower. If you feel like your standard Laphroaig could use a little more flavor that isn’t peat, you’ll probably enjoy this. It reminds me of the ']"
296,Laphroaig Cairdeas 2016 ,"[': Unmistakably Laphroaig, with an aroma evincing seaspray-battered coastlines, boggy with brine and seaweed and sea grasses. As with other Laphroaigs, the peat smoke is heavy on peat and light on smoke, giving a sense of smoldering peat rather than outright fire. Underlying the peat is a thin layer of sweetness, like a bushel of plums tossed into the kiln along with the rest. ', ': Medium bodied. Sooty peat dominates, while an incredibly gentle tongue burn for 51.6% ABV bakes your tongue. Fresh apple cider, maraschino cherries, and dates balance the herbal, medicinal peatiness.', ': Long. Here, the peat becomes ashy and betrays some bitter elements. The fruit is subdued but present, clashing slightly with the bitterness, but conveying a sense of cocktail bitters (sweet, bitter, medicinal, herbal). The cognitive dissonance is familiar to me from other ', ': A few drops of water dull most of the aroma, revealing instead a sticky dried prune note. The tongue burn is further diminished, but the whole becomes somewhat muddier and indistinct. Only add water if you feel the whisky is too hot when taken neat.', ': An unusual, decadent take on the standard Laphroaig brashness.

298,Laphroaig Select ,"[': Definitely Laphroaig – a sweet, spicy balance of ocean brine and beach bonfire smoke. Youthful, with a slight vegetal (grassy) quality verging on mezcal. The malt content seems sparse, without much foundation. Very little fruit, perhaps jarred strawberry jam.', ': Medium body. Slight lemon peel, heavy briny peat. Good malt-peat balance, with just enough grain-based sweetness. There is a streak of dried, jammy fruit running through it, but so mild I might have missed it. Indeed, during my first pass I didn’t think it was sherried at all.', ': Long. Slightly bitter, and the youth shows through with green grass and that odd tequila-like vegetal note. Lemon again, and mild red fruits. Fades with iodine and Band Aids (cresol).', ': Water seems to dull the aroma, muting the peat. It brings out even more lemon on the palate, and some additional sweetness. Skip the water, especially at this proof.', ': This runs in the same vein as a lot of recent NAS releases. They are marketed as having something special – partial sherry maturation (in this case), or partial finishing, or some unique barrel treatment, etc. – in order to get you to forget that the NAS label means they’ve dumped some younger barrels into the vatting, and on average is certainly going to be younger than the 10 year-old flagship (I have no information on the age of this, and my raw guess based on indie bottlings of younger-than-10-year peated malt, would be something like 6-7 years on average). Unlike a lot of those NAS releases, however, this one can be found for less money than the 10-year (IN SOME PLACES, see note below). This means it can be thought of as a compromise on the shelf: less money for less aging. It has the correct balance of lightly malty sweetness with briny seaweedy peat, but lacks a little dimension compared to the ']"
299,Laphroaig Triple Wood ,"[': Slightly muted (but recognizable) Laphroaig peat, with an immediate wave of fresh red fruits. This marriage creates a distinct ‘saltwater taffy’ vibe, of the red variety. Is ‘red saltwater taffy’ a tasting note? It is now. Deeper in there’s some plum jam, piney campfire smoke, and the usual Laphroaig ‘iodine’ (which I usually read as seaweed), although less than usual.', ': The red fruits come to the fore, and are sweeter than I expected – Jolly Rancher style. Red ones. Also, cinnamon red-hots, campfire smoke, seaspray, and wet charcoal.', ': Long-ish. The red fruit thing gets a little weird here. Jammy, but smoked. Without the sweet background of malt, it just leaves a taste like burned jam behind. At the tail end, a little bitter oak charcoal and some mint.', ': Water sparks up the fruitiness, and adds a little tartness. It does little on the palate besides tame the burn, although it allows some sweet notes to echo into the finish, thus reducing that dissonant burned jam note I mentioned. Water does help here.', ': This is not as well integrated as I’d like. When I drink Laphroaig, I want the bitter coastal salt-flecked winds of Islay to batter me. I want smoke and fire and salt. I don’t really want smoky jam… but that’s me. I usually have this reaction with sherry-aged peated malt (except ']"
300,Larceny Bourbon ,"[': Wood chips, cherry cough syrup, corn syrup (these all start out the same, don’t they?) Deeper in there’s some cake frosting and wood sap. There’s also something slightly astringent, but not quite paint thinner. Quite woody, and a significant nose tickle.', ': Strong burn for 46% ABV. Viscous. Initially marshmallow and balsa wood. Grassy and woody, with oak tannins obvious in the degree of mouth-drying pucker. Hazelnut butter and caramel round out a decent lineup of flavors.', ': Tobacco, burnt caramel, and more tannin. Medium length. Fades from slightly bitter to soft and sweet – Tootsie Rolls? Then ends with apricot pits.', ': Water picks up the astringent in the nose until it’s almost winey. Also reveals more vanilla. Softens the tongue burn considerably but adds a somewhat unpleasant charcoal/ash note. ', ': The nose is lackluster and overly biting (it would probably benefit from a longer rest in the glass), but some interesting flavors redeem the palate, and the finish is pleasantly non-bitter. Not too shabby for $25 bourbon out of a plastic miniature bottle. I like the effect of wheat on a bourbon (I think of it as tasting of vanilla instead of cinnamon) and while this is no Pappy Van Winkle, I like it far more than I like Maker’s Mark. For $25 or less, you can hardly go wrong with a great mixing bourbon and a reasonable sipping bourbon in the same bottle, especially if you’ve been underwhelmed by Maker’s Mark in the past.']"
301,Ledaig (10 year) ,"[': Unmistakably peated. Oily, with tobacco, iodine, vinegar, and smoke. The earthy peat of Tobermory is here totally eclipsed by in-your-face smokiness. Very similar to Islay malts, particularly the brash younger ones. The peat here is somewhat muddy and unfocused.', ': Medium body with some creaminess. The peat takes a step back, allowing its origin as Tobermory to show. Those industrial oily notes emerge, along with some caramel and vanilla, and a good dose of ashy barrel char.', ': Complex and long. Cigar ash, smoking meats, salty brine, and seaweed. Now the peat is in better harmony with the malt.', ': Water seems unnecessary – it makes the peat smell more like cigarette ash, to me, although it may sweeten the palate.', ': A nose overly dominant with peat is improved by better balance on the tongue and in the finish. While still less focused and more “dirty” (in the sense of the assorted unpleasant side-effects of peat) than similarly-priced Islays, there is reasonable complexity. For someone who loves peat but has grown tired of the standards, Ledaig offers a different take. It is especially enlightening when tasted alongside its brother-in-arms, Tobermory. Like Tobermory, Ledaig benefits from long-aging, and the older (20+ years) malts are considered to be refined and complex. For that reason, and for the unfocused, muddy quality of the peat, I don’t recommend Ledaig 10-year, although it is priced more competitively than its sibling, Tobermory.']"
302,Legent Bourbon ,"[': Beam green apple and green grass. Slight tart lemon note, and some kind of exotic fruit, like ', ': Thin body with an immediate and robust tongue burn. Almost (but not quite) too hot. Nice oaky sugars, nutty nougat, and more Beam-style cut grass.', ': On the longer side. Fruit finally appears, with elements of classic sherry (plum, raisin, vague rancio). Continues nutty and now with some rye spices (mostly clove) and not-at-all bitter oak.', ': Water adds a lot of acetone to the aroma but also adds sweetness (vanilla buttercream frosting) to the palate. There’s a little more oaky presence and caramel on the finish. Water optional – I would only add it if you need to proof it down, due to the acetone note it brings out on the nose.', ': Very good for the price. The sherry finish is detectable but not at all dominant. Really, due to its balance and assertive flavors this may be one of the best Beam whiskies that I’ve had. Well done, Suntory.']"
303,Loch Lomond Single Malt ,"[': Very light and floral aroma, with some stronger notes of honey, lavender, green banana, lemon peel, and fresh unmalted barley.', ': Medium bodied. Honeyed, with a tinge of tongue burn despite the low ABV. Flavor profile is mostly grain-based, with homemade yeasty bread, mashed bananas, malted cereal, and oatmeal with honey.', ': Very short. A reprise of the cereal notes, plus a bit of that lavender and honey, crushed peanuts, and musty hay. Pleasant enough, and not bitter. Fades with some barky oak, although it leaves behind a patina on the tongue of wet cardboard.', ': A few drops of water release a note of aloe on the nose, but dampens the florals. It has no discernible effect on the rest of the experience. I’d skip the water.', ': A mild, unassuming dram. It reminds me of a slightly less successful ex-bourbon cask ']"

Warming, with remnants of freshly-baked sugar cookies, fresh cashew butter, and white chocolate. No bitterness to speak of.', ': Water seems to only tame the burn (and useful, at that). It cuts a little of the cohesiveness, making the malt somewhat disjointed. I’d skip the water unless the burn is too much.', ': I’m coming at this a little backwards, having first tasted a ', '… we’re looking at an unreasonable $95 price tag, which I simply would not pay for a flagship official bottling at 16 years.

305,Longrow Peated ,"[': Straightforward smoke, with slightly briny peat. Sweet undertones of vanilla cream soda and fresh hay, plus a strong lemon peel note. After a rest in the glass, the peat takes a back seat to the lemon.', ': Syrupy body. Mild tongue burn which quickly reveals earthy peat, slowly smoldering campfire smoke, sandalwood, white peppercorn, and lemon custard.', ': Long. The best parts of the peat continue through the finish, accompanied by the same lemon note. Lingering flavors of fresh earth and smoke are joined by menthol. There is only very little charcoal bitterness. The finish fades gracefully and slowly, but without further evolution.', ': A few drops of water initially mute the nose entirely (including all the peat), necessitating a rest in the glass. First, a very shy floral note emerges, then business as usual. It also seems to thin the body. Skip the water.', ': An elegant, refined peat shares equal billing with decadent lemon oil. While there is no mistaking this as anything but a fully peated malt, the peat is not as in-your-face as other peated standards. On one hand this means less street cred for braving the tongue-thrashing available in ']"
306,Lost Distillery – Lossit ,"[': Lightly, teasingly, peated. White peach, green tea, and vanilla. Delicately sweet, with a very slight hay character.', ': Thin body. An initial bite of charcoal-flecked smoky peat (like Ardbeg). Mild tongue burn. Slightly meaty, black pepper, and only the barest sweetness. Much peatier than the aroma let on. Campfire.', ': Long. Peppery, with slightly bitter charcoal. Fades, leaving walnuts and cut hay. Bracing, drying, and spicy.', ': A few drops of water draw more peat out of the liquid, which seems mossy. It also noticeably sweetens the palate, adds a little body, and makes the finish more vibrant and tart. Water does not go amiss with this one.', ': This actually reminds me of a cross between young Ardbeg and Talisker. It is peppery and robust like Talisker, but with strong wood-fire (as opposed to maritime) peat and charcoal flavor, like Ardbeg. The peach and tea on the aroma is a nice bonus. This is priced about right in the low-$40s, and stands up to comparisons with single malts in that price-range although it’s not going to replace Laphroaig 10 for the mid-range peat spot in my cabinet. Having never tasted real 200 year-old Lossit, I can’t say how accurately this depicts the lost distillery’s character, but it definitely doesn’t stray far from modern peated malts already on the market.']"
307,Lost Republic Straight Bourbon ,"[': Spicy, but with a lingering waft of acetone. Rye-centric spice cabinet notes of clove, cinnamon, star anise, fenugreek, and fennel seed pervade, but one must continually ignore the nail-polish remover entwined with them. Very slightly grassy, this reminds me a bit of ', ': Thin body. Moderate tongue burn. Flavor is fleeting, mostly in the realm of cinnamon candy and cake batter.', ': Medium-long. A lot of sugar (caramel/toffee) appears on the finish, with a maple-tinged funugreek focus, and fades without much bitterness.', ': A few drops of water heighten the nose tickle and do little to reduce the acetone. The palate might be a little thicker, and the tongue burn less, but nothing much is achieved by adding water.', ': This is an oddball. On the nose, it smells like Buffalo Trace bourbon (vegetal) mixed with straight rye (spice) and aged about 2 years less than it should be (acetone). On the palate, it tastes like commodity whisky (bland). On the finish, it mutates into a sweet maple-y concoction with great oak/sugar balance and no bitterness. For the first time (ever), I find myself rushing through the stages of smelling and tasting so that I can relive the finish.']"
308,Lost Spirits – Leviathan II – Old Man And The Sea Cask ,"[': The Semillon punches through the haze of swampy peat with a laser-focused cherry tartness. The peat itself is intense and fungal, heavy on moss, industrial solvents, and piney compost. Underneath the malt itself is funky in true Lost Spirits style. Musty, moulding oak, smoked fish, and red wine vinegar.', ': Soft on the palate, cherry pie and cherry lozenge up front, followed by a robust mouth burn. A touch of raw honey, burning leaves, and dried cranberries.', ': Long. All of the notes from the aroma come back, but gentler and under more control. Here, there is a slight suggestion of the sweetness of the semillon, without as much tartness. The peat rides through, starting smoky and ending with moss and freshly-dug earth. On the tail end, menthol.', ': A generous dose of water reveals some barnyardy aromas – spoiled hay and livestock – and dials up the nose tickle. The water renders a creamier mouthfeel and reveals more barley on the tongue, however, it emphasizes bitterness on the finish that just wasn’t there at full proof. I think it’s better full strength. Note, though, that a long rest (30 minutes) integrates the water and yields a lot more sweetness. This is worth experimenting with.', ': As with the other Lost Spirits offerings, Leviathan II is neither a drink for the faint of heart, nor the seeker of refinement. Eccentric and bold, gamey and tart, this malt takes the usual Lost Spirits weirdness and encases it in a tart candy coating. Remember Warheads sour candy? I think it’s interesting – and slightly disappointing – that the sweet wine doesn’t bring much sweet character to this malt, and is instead responsible for the sour grape notes. Perhaps a port maturation is in order? Either way, if you’re looking for variety and excitement in your whiskey, this place is a gold mine. Lost Spirits continues to create otherworldly spirit with truly alien characteristics.']"
309,Lost Spirits Abomination ,"[': At first one thinks “Oh, golden raisins” and then one is socked in the nose by a potent barrage of peat. This is iodine-soaked, briny, seaweed peat. Unlike your typical Islay malt, however, this one is wrapped in a warm blanket of gooey caramel and drizzled with a white port reduction. By aroma alone, I would peg this at around 15 years of age and having spent time in new oak.', ': Thin body. Significant tongue burn (duh, it’s 54% ABV) that resolves into briny peat, toasted nori (seaweed), oaky sweetness (caramel).', ': Very long. Warming. Tobacco, (think a smoky cigar lounge), earthy, fungal peat, and a fading hint of clove.', ': A few drops of water spike the aroma with fresh, young peat and intensify the caramel notes. The palate becomes a little bitter, and has more spice notes like clove and cinnamon, as does the finish. Only add water if you need to proof it down.', ': A fully-formed expression of Islay peat with a mature, oaky intensity not often experienced in that category, even with older Islays. The restrained sweetness of the oaky caramels and the (very, very faint) raisiny fruit from the Riesling-seasoned wood balance very well against the youthful vibrancy of the peat. If someone forced me to guess the provenance of this whisky, blind, I would say it was 15 year-old Laphroaig finished in white port -seasoned new oak. I would be wrong, of course, about everything except (maybe?!) the Laphroaig. I think it’s Laphroaig.', ': Coffee, roasted cocoa nibs, and sooty, smoky peat. The aroma is drier than The Crying of the Puma, and the caramel notes are darker, like burnt caramel or hard-crack toffee (without the nuts). The seaweed character of the peat is harder to discern here, and I’m not sure I would have identified it as maritime peat if I hadn’t tried The Crying of the Puma first.', ': Thin body. Black coffee, followed by a significant tongue burn (54% ABV) that fades to reveal iodine, pungent tidepools (sea brine and weird fermenting seaweeds), wafting smoke, and more burnt caramel. A tad bitter.', ': Very long. Warming. A repeat of the notes from the palate – more black coffee, burnt caramel, and billowing briny peat smoke.', ': A few drops of water make the aroma sootier, but otherwise leave it unchanged. On the finish there is an added tart note. As with The Crying of the Puma, add water only if you prefer it proofed down.', ': This has everything that The Crying of the Puma has, except it is coated in a thick layer of sooty charcoal and roasted coffee flavors. The interplay between the “dark roast” notes and the Riesling comes across as an interesting dark chocolate-covered cherry type of note, but is otherwise hard to identify. I would never have guessed a wine-cask origin if tasting blind.']"
310,Lost Spirits Ouroboros ,"[': Peat dominates, but not in the familiar Islay style of sea-inflected vegetation. This is mossy and mushroomy. The smell is similar to the decaying of a felled tree, covered in lichen and varieties of fungus. Yes, there is smoke, but it underlines rather than head-lines. Integral to the aroma is a dense, sticky, resiny sherry quality quite unlike the venerable sherried malts of Scotland. This sherry is more like a reduction – stewed plums and berry preserves caramelized to the point of burning – and integrates nicely with the oddball peat. Beneath the interplay of peat and sherry lies the heart of what Lost Spirits is all about: the malt distillate is unusual, even off-putting in its individuality. Like the scent of a “sour” (wild yeast) beer, there is a cacophony of bacterial and yeasty aromas. Among these are mid-ferment beer, ripe gym socks, souring raw milk, sauerkraut, and deeper, mysterious scents that I am unequal to the task of identifying. The whole is mind-boggling and challenging: not for the faint of heart nor the quick-to-judge. I have not smelled depth of this kind in a whisky or whiskey before.', ': At cask strength, this is expectedly potent, but I would not call it rough. The first impression is of reduced marsala: meaty and winey and savory. The funky malt and funkier peat are released from their cloak of sherry and confound the palate as they did the nose. Fascinating and puzzling.', ': Very long. This is the type of peat that sticks with you and shows up hours later while you’re brushing your teeth. A bit of fresh fruit – berries – linger for a short time, but the majority is peat and some silky tannins which are in no way bitter.', ': A few drops of water do a good job of separating the three distinct elements on the nose: the sherry diminishes, the peat becomes distinct, and the malt announces itself. It also adds a bit of nuttiness to the palate and amps the smoke in the early part of the finish. Do try with and without water. When diluted down to around 40%, the peat’s smokiness dominates the nose. All of the weirdness is on display at this proof, but it loses something of its togetherness.', ': This is not whiskey you sit on the back porch and relax with. This is thinking whiskey. This whiskey challenges, coerces, and redefines itself. It beckons you to examine it deeper and then smacks you in the face with a sweaty gym sock. This is the kind of whiskey that you finish a glass of, and then realize you have no idea what just happened. You want another glass, but you have to admit you’re a little scared of it. I thank the malt gods that I had experienced the funkiness of sour beer before sampling Bryan’s work. I honestly cannot say if I would have been as accepting without that preparatory experience. I can very easily understand why so many bottles of Seascape and Leviathan I were returned to K&L after their debut – anyone buying a bottle without tasting it first runs the serious risk of hating it right away. That drives my rating decision: Try it before you buy it, or buy it with an open mind and an adventurous spirit.']"
311,Lost Spirits Umami ,"[': Maybe it’s the octopus on the label, but my senses are screaming ‘ocean’ – particularly brine and a dense, meaty seaweed. This isn’t just crispy nori, this is dripping, seawater-soaked seaweed with little pods hanging off of it. While the primary sensation is of tidepools and the feeling of ocean water in your sinuses, there are other layers – a figgy, raspberry jam element, salted caramel, smoked roe, and a core of white miso. This isn’t named Umami for nothing.', ': After a delayed (and intense) tongue burn, the peat really shines through. Driftwood bonfires and clambakes, with a lot of hay and bracken.', ': Long. Really long. Some of the sweet notes from the nose return here, along with jalapeno jelly, nutmeg, smoked salt, and a mouth-drying dose of oak tannin. There is, mercifully, no bitterness to speak of. Fades (after a good long while) with dusty dry spices and a touch of creosote.', ': A generous dose of water reveals much more peat smoke in the aroma, but seems to smash together all of the ‘layers’ into a bit of a muddle. It makes the tongue burn far easier to handle, though, and brings out a little more caramel sweetness, and maybe some taffy. I suggest giving this a good deep contemplation with your nose before proofing it down.', ': This certainly has the hallmarks of Bryan Davis’s work – funky and offbeat, its flavor pairings are just as unlikely (and just as successful) as salt with caramel and bacon with maple syrup. There’s also a bit more refinement here – a step back and an attention to detail that makes Umami, while still challenging, not nearly as wild-eyed and eccentric as previous releases.']"
312,Lot 40 Canadian Rye Whisky 2012 Release ,"[': Oh my God. Delicate cherry blossoms, crushed eucalyptus, sticky dried golden delicious apples. No dusty spice cabinet. Instead, the “rye spices” smell like freshly-opened seed pods of clove and allspice. I now know what rye whisky is supposed to smell like. This is -amazing-.', ': Soft. The spices are slightly more predominant on the tongue, with clear cinnamon and clove. Gingersnap cookies. Soft rye grain with a touch of oakiness and some vanilla-flecked caramel. Nice, but not as earth-shattering as the aroma.', ': Mild, medium-length. The eucalyptus returns, with a ghost of fresh mint leaves. Finishes totally devoid of bitterness.', ': Oddly, a few drops of water dulls the aroma. The palate is sweeter, with some nice fleshy stone fruit. I’d avoid the water here, just because of the disservice it does to that lovely aroma.', ': This isn’t saying much, but this is the best Canadian whisky I’ve ever had. It’s also the best nose I’ve ever smelled on anything with rye in it. Hell, I’ll say it, it’s even better (on the nose) than any bourbon I’ve tried, including those from Van Winkle. The palate doesn’t quite live up to the promise of the nose (what can?), but is soft and subtle in its own right. The finish is sedate and unobtrusive. Really, though, I could sit here and smell this all night.']"

Oaky, with loads of vanilla and dried coconut. A bit of young grain mars the progression.', ': Brown sugar, corn syrup, charcoal, and a little bit of mouth-drying tannin.', ': A few drops of water bring a bit of vanilla to the nose, but otherwise have no appreciable effect. Water is strictly optional.', ': Well it’s a pretty standard mid-grade bourbon. There are no stand-out elements, and even the wheat is only halfheartedly present. I would put this a step or two under W.L. Weller in quality. When mixing a bourbon-centric cocktail, I might be inclined to use Maker’s Mark if I don’t want to shell out for something top shelf. The 45% ABV fills out the flavor and keeps it from feeling thin, which would be an added bonus in cocktails. It would make a killer julep. I’ve given this a ‘Recommended’ rating because as long as you know what you’re getting, $25 for a decent wheated bourbon is not a bad deal.']"

Sweet corn (cornbread), plain bubblegum, marzipan, blanched almonds, and some light oak.', ': Short. Reminiscent of the aroma – slightly tangy and quite sweet in a high-fructose corn syrup kind of way. Ends quickly with more bubblegum, and no bitterness.', ': Water intensifies the weird artificial fruit notes in the aroma, and adds a layer of fresh creamed corn on the palate. At 40%, this definitely does not need any water.', ': This stuff has a powerful memory trigger for all the sweet fake sugary stuff I ate as a kid. If it weren’t… you know… ', ' it could almost be marketed to children. I would be totally unsurprised to learn that some loophole in the TTB labeling laws had allowed Buffalo Trace to tip a couple of ounces of bubblegum artificial flavoring into each vat. As it stands, I have no idea how they got this stuff to taste like this. I said earlier that it barely tastes like bourbon, with that wateriness and weird candy notes, so don’t buy this if you’re expecting a cheap-but-solid bourbon.']"
317,McCarthy’s Oregon Single-Malt ,"[': Meaty and full of peat – a blast of it, in fact. A campfire of burning pine needles, with an interesting depth of nuances. No iodine or fishiness, just sappy, resiny peat, mild oak, and an undercurrent of mildly sweet barley. Smells like an 8 or 10 year-old Caol Ila or Bowmore, with a little more ppm.', ': Soft and warming. Lots of nice malty sugar. Rice candy. Peat is not intense, and the smoothness on the palate belies its youth. Tastes well-crafted.', ': Pine and peat pervade, but the youth shows with evaporating raw alcohol and a vein of oaky bitterness. Lingers like most Islays.', ': Amazing that a three year-old whisky distilled on a tiny brandy still in Oregon can smell and taste like an 8 or 10 year-old Islay single malt scotch. Sure, the imported barley has a lot to do with that, but Steve McCarthy’s attention to detail, careful (and economical) use of oak, and small slowly-running stills all come through in the product, which somehow tastes handcrafted. I could wish it had a few more years in barrel to smooth out the wrinkles and improve that finish, but this is clearly an excellent product from a master distillery. You are still paying the ‘craft’ premium here: $50 is a lot for three years of aging, but if you’re looking to see what the ‘craft’ revolution is all about, this is a great place to start.', ' I haven’t been keeping up with Clear Creek Distillery since I wrote this review 9 years ago. I have heard reports that McCarthy’s malt can have some batch variation, which can mean your second bottle might not be as impressive as your first. I recently tasted a sample in a blind tasting, and while I don’t have enough notes to publish a full review, I can say that I found it heavily iodine/medicinal/chemical to the point of almost smelling like urine (sorry). I also found that its lack of balancing sweetness and development of undesirable ashy/tar notes were hard to get past. It did not score well in our blind tasting. In light of the batch variation, I have moved this down to a “Try Before Buy” rating: specifically you should try to taste the same batch that you’re intending to buy, if possible.', ' than the factory-produced, lower-priced competition. If I make one bottle a day of hand-crafted dragonfruit eau-de-vie on a solid gold 20-gallon pot still and age it in 5-liter barrels made from solid mahogany… I shouldn’t expect to make up my costs by charging $2000 a bottle unless it ', ' like $2000 a bottle. McCarthy’s, at least, tastes worth it. For all those other craft distillates out there – I say they have to pass the same test.']"
318,McKenzie Bottled-in-Bond Wheated Bourbon ,"[': Unctuous wheated bourbon, with heavy notes of baked goods (coffee cake), roasted coffee beans, chunk charcoal, pecan pie, and molasses. Minimal nose tickle for 100 proof.', ': Soft, medium bodied. Heavy tongue burn. Chocolate-covered cherries, cacao nibs, blackberry jam. Prominent oak. Complex.', ': Long. Slightly bitter black coffee, cherry liqueur (or is it cough syrup?). This lingers. Nice.', ': A few drops of water amplify the cherries – making them fresh – and adds tartness. The palate retains its body but is brighter. The finish is a little sweeter and more in balance. I very much recommend water with this bourbon.', ': This doesn’t share a lot of notes with other notable wheated bourbons, but it does have a distinct and unique flavor profile that I really appreciate.

319,Michter’s US*1 Bourbon ,"[': Maple syrup. Heavy corn syrup and oaky notes, with caramelized sugars (toffee), cherry bitters, and oak varnish or furniture polish. Heady, but without a strong nose tickle.', ': Syrupy body. An initial impression of maple sugar candies followed by a strong tongue burn (a bit hot for 45%). Through the haze, there are cinnamon red-hots, maple syrup, and cocktail bitters (Angostura). A vague hint of vegetal grassiness, but obscured by the heaviness of the oak and sugars. ', ': Medium-long. Cherry lozenge. A hint of charcoal but without any bitterness.', ': Several drops of water increases the nose tickle and adds grassiness. On the tongue, the water draws out some nutty notes, like toasted pecans, but thin the body. The finish is also grassier. Take or leave water with this one.', ': This is a quintessential bourbon. It has all of the hallmarks of a low-rye, mid-proof bourbon: cinnamon sweets, big oak, corn syrup, cherry notes, bitter charcoal, and a little youthful grassiness. If this were $20 I’d be calling it the ']"
320,Milford Single Malt (10 year) ,"[': An abundance of tropical fruits, namely green banana, papaya, and pineapple. A slightly grassiness and a nutty (coconut?) undertone. Resting in the glass brings out vanilla sweetness that evokes banana cream pie. Luckily, that banana note never turns overripe.', ': Thin body. Mild tongue burn, followed by dry oak and vague nut butter. Bitter charcoal and earthiness (peat?) emerge with a bit of banana pudding. Somewhat confused, and a little too bitter here for my taste.', ': Medium-short. Dry and mouth-drying, somewhat bitter. Coconut returns, now dried, along with bitter herbs and cut grass. Fades with a suggestion of dark-roast coffee grounds which are… again… bitter.', ': A few drops of water seem to dull the aroma, clamping down on those nice fruits. Normally a rest in the glass would fix this, but here it doesn’t. The palate is, perhaps, sweeter and has a bit more sweet-bitter balance. It also has more banana. The finish is also sweeter. If you do decide to add water to this dram, make sure to give it a good nosing first.', ': A pleasant flurry of tropical fruits and the near-miss of banana (an aroma note which tends to ruin malts for me) is offset by a muddied palate and an overly-bitter finish. There is not much here that you can’t get from any other single malt with a decade of maturation in ex-bourbon. If you happen to live in a region where this is locally available and cheaper than malt imported from Scotland, or if the mystique of trying a dead distillery’s whisky before it’s gone forever appeals to the romantic in you, then you’ll find it’s at least as good as any 10-year single-malt scotch you might find. I just wouldn’t seek it out myself or pay a premium for it. $40 is fine, $60+ not so much.']"
321,Monkey Shoulder ,"[': Crisp, clear malty grains, almost beery. A touch of lemon. No nose-tickle or heavy scents of oak, just lightly sweet and round. After a rest in the glass, there is a heavy layer of vanilla extract.', ': Initially a wave of lemon peel and caramel accompanied by slight tongue burn. This passes quickly, leaving nougat, mineral water (almost like tonic, with a touch of herbal-like quinine) and vanilla frosting.', ': Short. Nougat all over, nutty and sweet, but quickly vanishing with a fading hint of dry oaky tannins and a bit of charcoal which leaves the mouth wishing for a little better balance.', ': A few drops of water amplify the citrus in the aroma which (when paired with the vanilla notes) remind me of lemon salt-water taffy. The palate has less burn, and tastes a little rounder – more “filled out”. I recommend a little water with this.', ': This is the kind of dram that you show to your friends who think “whisky” means something you add to Coke. Then you tell them it’s only $30. A gentle introduction to the world of malt whisky, with a very welcoming profile and a gentle effect on the palate, all with a nice array of grains and sweets that showcase what good middle-of-the-road ex-bourbon Scotch malt whisky is like. The finish could be better-balanced, and the aroma could use more lemony/fruity top notes, but that’s splitting hairs at this price. This also makes it a reliable staple for the “low end” section of your cabinet, something you can easily toss back on ice without guilt, or mull in a tulip glass after a meal. Or, hell, you could even make cocktails with it (a practice encouraged by the brand). A jack-of-all-trades, if you will, but master of none.']"
322,Mortlach (15 year) – Game of Thrones “Six Kingdoms” ,"[': Meaty, sulfury classic Mortlach. Raisins, figs, dates. Fresh banana. My brother-in-law suggested that it smelled like pennies, which I agree with. It’s coppery, but I wouldn’t call it metallic. Fairly complex, there’s definitely more deeper in the glass that I’m not picking up on yet. Invites a second and third and fourth nosing…', ': Heavy body. Moderate burn, slightly hotter than I’d expect for 46% ABV. Flavorful, with a lot of the same notes from the aroma repeated. A chewy date shake with banana cream. ', ': Medium length. A bit of barrel char / charcoal appears, and while the meaty/coppery flavor persists, a lot of the fruit has dropped out. Fades without much evolution, aside from a ghost of menthol on the very tail end.', ': A few drops of water initially mute the aroma, necessitating a rest in the glass. The water picks out a little more banana on the aroma, and adds a layer of sweetness (vanilla / cake frosting) but not much else. The water does make the palate a little more vibrant and adds a tart note there and on the finish… orange peel. Water doesn’t hurt here, but try it without water first.', ': This gets a “Recommended” rating, but only at the current closeout price. It’s not the best Mortlach I’ve had, but it’s still Mortlach with an age statement and that’s not something that you can often just pick off a shelf. I would have been severely disappointed if I had paid the full $150 retail price for this. I paid $80, and I’d say that’s the upper limit of its value. At the current closeout price of $60 I think it’s an excellent deal especially if you’ve never had any Mortlach before.']"
323,Mortlach Rare Old ,"[': Thin and somewhat insubstantial. Clearly very little sherry influence, just ex-bourbon (possibly refill). Very light lemon (lemonade), stale biscuit, blanched almonds, fresh banana, and pale honey. Malty, but insipid. Does not smell particularly “young” – I would make a wild guess of around 10 years by aroma.', ': Syrupy body. Sweet up front, with only moderate tongue burn. A nutty dimension appears – cashews or Brazil nuts – along with a slight bitterness, like walnut skins. A reprise of all the notes from the aroma. Well-balanced but unexceptional. No off-notes or “too young” flavors.', ': Short. Malty, with a hint of peanut butter. Fades without any additional complexity.', ': A few drops of water add a papery, grassy aroma and bring more banana to the palate. I don’t recommend any water with this.', ': An unchallenging dram that one could even call uninteresting. At the price I paid ($41 US for 500ml), I wasn’t terribly disappointed although I would have been a bit miffed to pay $60 for 750ml. Yes, I’m aware of how little sense that makes. This bottle has also taught me that what I really like about Mortlach is not its “blank slate” nature, but rather its ability to meld with ']"
324,Nikka From The Barrel – Japanese Whisky ,"[': Pear drops, tropical fruits (kiwi or starfruit or something), and a lot of green banana. The aroma is, as expected, powerful and tends to crawl up your nose if you get too close. There is complexity to be had here – underneath that domineering banana note resides a nice depth of oaky sweetness and a hefty dose of malt.', ': Wow, take small sips of this. Concentrated and robust, with loads of tart fruits and brash, fiery alcohol. I wouldn’t call this particularly mellow, but the oakiness is in excellent balance with the fruit, and the high proof makes it dance on the tongue.', ': The dominant note turns to caramel. Very nice. Caramelized banana? A bit of barrel tannin – a hint of bitterness – creeps in at the end.', ': Water adds a bit of vanilla to the nose, has a bit of a taming effect on the tongue burn (a bit), and might amp up the tartness on the finish. Water certainly doesn’t hurt, here.', ': This is, I think, my first cask-strength blended whisky. The high proof seems to minimize the flavor of whatever grain whisky is present, for me. I get a ton of delectable fruits (most of which are tart, my favorite kind of fruit notes in whisky), excellent balance of wood and malt sweetness, and a proof that’s just the right amount of intensity straight-up, but can also handle some water. Nice stuff, even with the dominant banana notes.']"

Clearly peated, although the peat seems to run in the salty/seaweed direction rather than the smoky/campfire direction. Fades slowly, with evolving notes of crispy fish skin, nori, seawater, and finally iodine.', ': A few drops of water open up a lot of iodine, medical tape adhesive, band-aids, and mutes the savory notes a bit. On the palate, it accentuates instead the meaty / pork notes. I would avoid the water with this one, unless you find it a little hot and in need of proofing down. Even then, don’t add much.', ': Peaty, with the same notes as the more seaweed-flecked Islay malts like Laphroaig but without the same intensity. As much as I respect Japanese malts, I find this to be a copycat of Scottish malt from Islay.

Not overly woody, but roundly sweet. Lousy with caramel, and a nip of banana. Right full of flavor, and ritzy to boot.', ': Medium bodied. A haymaker to the tongue, this burns like a house on fire.

Dry, with more of that bitter charcoal right away and little sweetness to balance it. Eventually the bitterness turns vegetal, like cocktail bitters, before fading.', ': A few drops of water open up a nice additional fruit aroma, like cherry candy (Jolly Ranchers), and makes the palate initially sweeter and tames some of the tongue burn. It even allows that cherry note to echo on the finish. I highly recommend a little water with this.', ': It starts strong, with classic bourbon flavors in appropriate balance, but then quickly devolves into an overly-hot, overly-dry bitter mess. After the first sip, the palate is somewhat ruined by all the bitterness and the experience becomes monotonous. Water improves it a bit (indeed, water is essential), but can’t single-handedly save this whiskey. Most of this is irrelevant in a well-mixed cocktail, but neat I cannot recommend it even at this price. If you find it for $20, you can dump it in cocktails without remorse.

There are also elements of cherry pie filling, caramel, powdered cinnamon, and dark chocolate-covered cherries. This otherwise pleasant-sounding combination is marred by overbearing charcoal and astringent, cardboard-like oakiness.', ': Medium-short. Corn (think Corn Nuts), charcoal (but oddly without the usual charcoal bitterness), cinnamon, and more tobacco. Fades without changing much.', ': Several drops of water (yes, please!) have little obvious effect on the aroma. The palate, however, is far easier to handle and contains sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla. If you’re tasting this I suggest smelling it, adding a very little water, tasting it, and then adjusting with more water to your preference.', ': This is very basic, corn-forward, Jim Beam-esque, full-strength whiskey. This is the kind of thing you use when you want a cocktail or recipe to taste like “bourbon” but without caring much about the nuance. The kind of thing you order so that you can shoot it and feel like a frontiersman at a dingy saloon in ']"
336,Old Grand-Dad Bourbon (40% ABV) ,"[': Light corn syrup, candied apple, maraschino cherries, substantial nose tickle. Lively and bright aroma, not unpleasant. Maybe a hint of clove or cinnamon.', ': A bit watery. On the rough side, with a lot of young, unripe alcohol. Resolves into pine sap, cherry pie filling, and fresh corn. Light, and not overly wooded.', ': A hint of wood, an echo of the fruits from the aroma and a suggestion of marshmallow and soft caramels. Not bitter, not bad.', ': Water increases the suggestion of baking spices on the nose, brings out too much raw alcohol on the palate, and makes the finish ragged. I’d skip the water.', ': It’s not the most amazing bourbon in the world, but it’s light, refreshing, young, and vibrant. There are some interesting flavors and aromas, and except for its watery texture and low proof, it’s probably quite decent in a cocktail, and not altogether objectionable straight up. I think it’s interesting that despite being young, being filled into a plastic bottle and sitting in my cabinet for six months to a year, this whiskey has not suffered in the slightest. I’m willing to take that as evidence that bad 50ml experiences (of which I’ve had quite a few) come from bad batches, not bad bottles. C’mon whisky industry, wake up and realize that people use these things to sample your products, not just to dump together a manhattan on an airplane! Also, good on you, Old Grand-Dad. This is a respectable pour of cheap bourbon, and it makes me very interested in trying the higher-proof versions. If you’re looking for inexpensive bourbon, this is a good place to start, although I’d seek out the 100-proof Bottled In Bond (50% ABV) one.']"
337,Old Malt Cask: Talisker (6 year) 2009-2016 ,"[': Fishy peat with a heap of black peppercorn, thin malty grain, and chalky minerals. Seaspray and absolutely no sherry whatsoever. Complex, young, and fiery.', ': Thin body. Aggressive tongue burn, which clears slowly to reveal some vanilla sweetness, sea-salt caramels, and a drifting hazy fugue of peat – like being in a cold-smoker cabinet after the fire has gone out.', ': Long. More of that salty caramel, now with a seaweed chaser (yum!). More black pepper and now some tobacco. Fades very slowly to a dry, cigarette-like smoke, which is somewhat acrid.', ': A few drops of water release a lemon peel (verging on Lemon Pledge) note, which conflicts oddly with the fish (ok, ok, “brine”) notes. It does, however, tame the fieriness a bit. I can see wanting a little water for that reason.', ': Man, this is really not good. But at $40, I also really can’t complain. This confirms two suspicions that I’ve had: One, that ultra-young peated malts contain more peat flavor than their standard 10- and 12-year elder siblings. Two, that there’s a reason peated malts are usually released at 10 or 12 years of age. The smoke and peat and brine need some time to integrate, to mellow, and to lose that brash, acrid aspect. Unfortunately, this may as well have been aged in cardboard for all the total and complete lack of sherry character. The label might as well have just said “aged in a barrel”.']"
338,Old Overholt Rye ,"[': Burning rubber tires. Clove, cardamom, stale spices. Shoe leather. Vinyl polish (“new car smell”). Marzipan.', ': Medium body. Mildly sweet. Cinnamon rolls, tanned leather, old hay.', ': Very short. Rye malt beer, a hint of cinnamon “red hots” candies. Fades quickly with nothing – not even bitterness.', ': A few drops of water adds some star anise and a mild tartness – like cider vinegar – to the aroma. It also brings out a fresh apple note on the palate and lengthens the finish, adding some nuttiness. I highly recommend adding some water if you’re stuck with a glass of this.', ': Obviously, this was intended for mixing and not sipping straight. Nevertheless, if I dislike a whisky straight up then I’m not likely to want to make cocktails with it, especially when there are better choices (like ']"
339,Old Pulteney (12 year) ,"[': Everyone always says ‘salty’ when talking about OP. To me, it smells more like a heavily vegetal tequila. Seaweed, cooked cactus (nopales), lime peel, and a hint of vanilla. All of the aromas are robust – nothing light about this whisky.', ': Salted caramel, roasted chestnuts, a sticky, industrial grime (a little like the ‘dirty’ flavor of Springbank), like grimy pennies.', ': Some sweetness arrives, dry taffy, shortbread cookies. The finish gets grassy again, but without any bitterness. Ends on the woody side.', ': Water adds a tart note, a more distinct lime peel or even key lime pie, to the nose and makes the finish slightly sweeter. Some water can’t hurt.', ': Somewhat of a rollercoaster of unique flavors and aromas, paired with off-putting and off-seeming notes like grimy pennies. It’s a bit like a woodsier, grassier, more tequila-like variant of Springbank. Very little sweetness, this is almost more of an aperitif or digestif than a dessert drink, although missing the bitter herbs. I would seek out a taste of this before committing to a bottle, even if you’re a Springbank fan. It’s just not for everybody.']"
340,Old Pulteney (17 year) ,"[': Yup. Brine. A definite whiff of freshly-trodden seaweed on a windswept shoreline… yes, whisky always makes me wax poetic. Seawater and something citrus: lemon saltwater taffy. Tangy peat – like ', ': Soft. Lively tongue burn. Some light barrel char and malty caramelized grains. The tip of my tongue picks up some of those tart lemon/cherry notes. The rest tastes like somewhat standard bourbon-aged single malt.', ': Medium long. Principally sweet – caramel again. Driftwood fire smoke. Vanilla saltwater taffy now. Fades with smoked lemon peels. Many writers call it ‘dry’, but I don’t get that.', ': Water makes the nose a little too sharp – although it awakens some mild fruitwood smoke notes. The water does a nice job of taming the tongue burn, and spreads out those lemon – now lemon custard – notes across the whole palate. Try without the water first, and then see if it does anything interesting for you.', ': Unless those additional four years cause magic to happen, I don’t agree with Jim Murray. It is a tasty, straightforward malt with an excellent tart/briny nose and some interesting smoky notes on the finish. It can’t compete with Islay for peatiness, nor with Highland Park for value (especially after the prices shot up with the Whisky Bible award). If you’re a fan of the briny/tart character and can’t get enough of Highland Park and Clynelish, then this is probably a must-have for your shelf. If not, maybe it’s worth buying a special-occasion bottle to try for yourself to understand what Jim Murray thinks is so wonderful about the distillery.']"
341,Old Pulteney Navigator ,"[': Industrial oils and solvents with briny, meaty peat and tarry molasses. Not even a little sweet. Of course, I say that and then a rest in the glass adds some brown sugar.', ': Medium body. A robust tongue burn (more than expected for 46%) is followed by sludgy seaweed, muddy peat (without the smoke), and engine grease. At last there is a very slight sweetness in the form of dark treacle or molasses, and some slight fig notes that only appear after a rest in the glass. (Ah! There’s the sherry. I guess.)', ': Long. The molasses appears first, finally showing some brown sugar instead of just vegetal tar. Some mouth-drying oaky tannins that are surprisingly not bitter. The whole thing lingers, intact, for quite awhile.', ': A few drops of water add a little nose tickle and round out the small amount of sweetness in the aroma. The body is thinner, but the palate flavors are more likable and even has a new, tart lime note that pairs well with the rum-y flavors. I definitely suggest trying this without and then with some water.', ': It’s certainly maritime in that it smells like something slathered on a hull to make it seaworthy. I kid. Sort of. There is an intrusion of peat but absolutely no smoke, which makes it smell and taste earthy but without evoking Islay’s style of smoky peat. The overall effect is brooding and difficult, and that so-called partial sherry cask aging is thoroughly in the background. I’m not sure I could enjoy this regularly, although I appreciate the complexity and the stubborn rum-like lack of affability.']"
342,Old Soul Blended Straight Bourbon ,"[': Heavy nose tickle, but a good amount of caramel and nutty oak. The combination reminds me of pecan pie. It’s sweet on the nose, but not overly so.', ': Medium body. Strong but brief tongue burn. More of the same notes from the aroma, but there’s also more spice here – cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, a bit of barrel char, and a little bit of pine sap.', ': Medium length. A nice round, tart cherry note takes over and meshes nicely with the spices, which proceed through the finish. Finishes without evolving.', ': A few drops of water bring out a lot of the spices that were hiding, and adds a vanilla bean note. The water doesn’t seem to affect the palate, but makes the finish a bit sweeter. Definitely try this with a little water.', ': As I’ve taken to saying quite often lately, MGP makes some damn fine whiskey. Cathead’s blend turns the MGP components into a very tasty bourbon, with a lot of classic bourbon elements that are tied together nicely. The youth is detectable via a little pine note and a little extra vegetal bitterness at the tail end of the finish, but those are minor issues. Obviously, I’d prefer a higher percentage of Cathead’s own whiskey in the blend and I’ll be interested to see what a bottle of 100% Cathead whisky tastes like if they ever bottle one. If you have a tie to Mississippi or are in the area and see this on a shelf and want to support a local business, it’s probably worth a taste. Worst case, it’ll make perfectly acceptable bourbon cocktails.']"
343,Old Tub Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon ,"[': Cork. Chewy chocolate nougat. Caramel popcorn. ', ': Robust, heavy body, almost chewy. Tongue burn is as-expected for 100 proof. Most of the aroma compounds continue onto the palate. It actually tastes like it smells. There’s also some cherry and cinnamon and a bit of charcoal.', ': On the short side. A little menthol picks up on the finish, and it fades without much change, but also without any bitterness.', ': A few drops of water don’t seem to change things much, aside from maybe adding a touch of corn-syrup sweetness to the aroma and palate. I actually prefer it without the water, but it’s cheap enough to experiment with. See what ice does, too – see if you can detect the visual “unfiltered” difference when it becomes chilled.', ': Something unique in bourbon? What?! Seriously, I expected this to be reconstituted Jim Beam with a soupçon of marketing, but no! I don’t know if it’s the lack of filtration or the barrel selection or what, but this is not only downright tasty bourbon, it’s also got an honest-to-God antique character. Tasting this, I actually feel like someone from 1920 knocking back a glass in a saloon after a hard day on the trail, or whatever. This gives me the same sense of history that some older single malt scotches do, when they smell like barnyard/hay.']"
344,OOLA Waitsburg Bourbon ,"[': Vodka-esque acetone notes greet (assault?) the nose first, followed immediately by an almost-cloying refined sweetness, like powdered sugar or unflavored rock candy. The vodka is accompanied by some nice (by vodka standards) notes of fruit-and-flowers variety (juniper berries, kiwi, orange blossom). And now that I’ve noticed the juniper, I can’t get the scent-memory of gin out of my head.', ': Medium-bodied. Woody up front, with a lot of pine sap and wet sawdust. Not too hot, even for 47% ABV. The sweet notes are prevalent here, as well, with abundant caramel/butterscotch and a nice light cereal flavor. Alas, what would be a nice light bourbon flavor is marred by more of that acetone / paint thinner.', ': On the short side. Rock candy again, a touch of pine, and a bit of barrel charcoal that isn’t quite bitter. A bit thin, and over quickly.', ': Water, of course, amps up the vodka notes. It does add a pleasant silkiness to the body, but I’d still say skip the water.', ': A thoroughly disappointing experience. One has been conditioned, these days, to think of craft whiskey as the purview of the quality-obsessed, the flavor-conscious, the skilled craftsmen who can do it better than the big boys because they aren’t shackled by the lowest-common denominator or hampered by a board of directors. This is, however, distinctly worse than most bottom-shelf bourbons in every way I can think of. I’ve only tasted that acetone/paint thinner note in the cheapest spirits (usually those blended with straight grain whiskey), and this has no backbone of oak nor raft of flavors or aromas to offset the overpowering suggestion of vodka.']"
345,Paddy Irish Whiskey ,"[': Heady, grain-forward whiskey with a lot of hay-flecked oiliness and a grimy/sooty nearly-peat-like earthy quality. Slight vanilla sweetness deep in the glass, but main impression is dry.', ': Syrupy body. Again grain-forward, with a bit more tongue burn than I expected at 40% ABV. Sweet, with a lot of cereals, honey, and a hint of cocoa nibs.', ': On the short side. Here the acetone / paint-thinner notes finally show. Mild nuttiness and a bit of bitter charcoal.', ': A few drops of water amp up the weird industrial notes and add some acidity (white vinegar) to the aroma. The water thins the palate somewhat, and adds vague sweetness to the finish. Water not necessary, but it doesn’t hurt anything.', ': Not. Bad. The impression is heavy on the grain, and there is a weird sooty oiliness that could be off-putting, but it is well-balanced by sweetness on the tongue and a delay of the inevitable “young grain” acetone to the finish. It lacks the heavy caramel notes of ']"

347,Pappy Van Winkle’s Family Reserve Bourbon (20 year) ,"[': Dripping caramel, dense vanilla, honey candy, and bright fresh orange peel. Intensely oaky, but not dry or astringent. Potent and concentrated, and a little more nose tickle than expected from 45% ABV. After a rest in the glass, the grain notes come forward and smell like moist baked goods (', ': Silky, syrupy body. Potent hazelnut butter note upfront, with minimal tongue burn. Soft, with flecks of charcoal and sweet dense oak, but without any bitterness. High notes of orange peel and cherry liqueur.', ': Medium-long. Still sweet, but drying out with mild tannins. A wave of menthol. Lingers, finishing slowly without any bitterness. Classic.', ': A few drops of water amp up the nose tickle without adding anything new. The palate is a little more tart, but otherwise unchanged. There is no need to add water to this. Enjoy it as is.', ': Pappy hysteria aside, this stuff is really tasty. Flawless, potent, concentrated flavor and without the eye-watering proof of the younger expressions. Surprisingly not overly-oaked (like the Internet claims), but also not really markedly different than the 15 year. In fact, I would probably be unable to say which was older if tasted side-by-side, if it weren’t for the difference in proof. It does strike me as somewhat sweeter than I expected, but in a good non-cloying way. Truly rewarding in the glass. Too bad about the ridiculous waiting lists and secondary market prices.']"
348,Peach Street Distillers Bourbon ,"[': Cinnamon red hots, SPICY. A bit hot in the nose for 46%. Anise seed, spiced orange peel, caraway, baked apples.', ': Hot, young and excitable. Spices again. Some oak. Potently flavored. Bright – an enthusiastic newcomer.', ': Medium long. Taffy? Black licorice abounds. Some nice mild barrel tannins.', ': Adds some grass on the nose, and fresh raw corn. Makes the palate sweeter.', ': Well, it’s quite good. It has the air of an excited young pupppy, full of life and excitement and bounding with energy, as opposed to some older bourbons which are like plodding old hounds, wise in their years and contemplative. Unfortunately, young craft whiskey comes at a price. $63 for a 2 year-old bourbon? That’s the kind of price I might pay after touring the distillery and bringing home a souvenir bottle… but it’s unlikely to become a staple bourbon in my house with such a pricetag.']"
349,Penderyn Madeira Single Malt Welsh Whisky ,"[': The first word that comes to mind is “clean”. Penderyn smells ', ': Creamy mouthfeel. Moderate tongue burn. Very nutty, with layers of pistachio and hazelnut over a bed of crisp roasted malt. The madeira only comes through on the end, with notes of golden raisin and a bare touch of balsamic.', ': Medium-long. Drying, with a bit of grape-skin tannin and even more nuttiness. Ends pleasantly, with no bitterness.', ': A few drops of water release a bumper crop of grape skins and white vermouth, making the nose somewhat drier. The palate is still creamy, and is undiminished by the water, which also pulls out a little more pure barley flavor. Try this both with and without water.', ': An excellent example of how high-quality a whisky can be made outside of the traditional whiskymaking countries. Penderyn is focused, superbly balanced, eminently flavorsome, and crystal clean. All at the correct strength – 46%. I could have been tricked into thinking this was a single-grain whisky, with all of that creaminess and clarity. A pleasure.']"

351,Pig’s Nose Blended Scotch ,"[': Quintessential blended scotch: dry hay, lemon peel, and some faint peat that is on the maritime side (briny). Comes across a bit watery at this proof. A brief rest in the glass opens up more sweetness in the form of vanilla buttercream frosting.', ': Syrupy body. Mild tongue burn, and not as watery as the aroma suggested even at 40% ABV. Sweetness emerges first, with light toffee and white chocolate. Next, the grain appears in the form of fresh hay and puffed oats. Lastly, the peat leaves a twist of earthiness.', ': Short. The peat is more evident here, along with cocoa nibs, bitter charcoal, and walnuts. Fades quickly, leaving some sooty bitterness as the last note.', ': A sparse few drops of water have little to no apparent effect on the aroma. The palate seems more spirity (like vodka). Skip water here.', ': The addition of an Islay peat is no doubt intended to make this blend complex, but instead I find that it just distracts from the rather surprising purity of the grain and malt despite the (I’m assuming) young age. The finish is a bit of a disappointment… I expected it to be brief, but did not expect so much lingering acrid bitterness. I don’t know if that’s from the peat or not, but it’s a little unpleasant. The rest of the experience, though, is nice and certainly performs well for the price.']"
352,Pike Creek Canadian Whisky (Port Finish) ,"[': Piercing nose tickle, surprising for such a low ABV. The initial impression is of fruit punch with artificial sweetener in it. Saccharine, sticky, and cloying. Next, you realize the nose tickle smells like repulsive bottom-shelf vodka mixed with nail polish remover. The fruit is one-dimensional and smells of fruit-flavored candy rather than actual fruit.', ': Syrupy body. Mild tongue burn. There is a wood note (oak sugars) which is welcome, but the cheap vodka flavor invades quickly, as does the aspartame and candy notes.', ': Medium-long, unfortunately. Warming, with a little bit of caramel and oak mixed with the unrelenting vodka notes. Finishes with a bit of port wine, which finally tastes slightly like something real. This is, however, marred by the sudden appearance of charcoal bitterness, which is all that remains when the finish fades.', ': I’m not sure why you’d bother, but a few drops of water actually increase the nose tickle, which now feels like someone is painting acetone on the inside of my nostrils with one of those nail polish brushes. The palate is thinner and tastes watery in addition to all the terrible things that it already was. The finish is unchanged. Eyuchhh.', ': I’m not sure I’ve ever had such an irredeemably awful glass of whisky. The liquid provides ample warning of what’s to come with its repugnant aroma, and those that fail to heed the signs will be greeted by an increasingly wretched experience, right down to the unmercifully long finish. Maybe it would have been more bearable if the “Elements” that “Crafted” it had been allowed another 3 years to work. If you happen to see some of these bottles still lying around on sale, I can’t say this often or loudly enough: Do Not Buy This Whisky.']"
353,Pikesville Rye ,"[': Dusty warehouse floor – nearly fungal – with a coating of dry cocoa powder. These two aromas are so dominant that they wash out anything else. Chocolate warehouse floor. Check. A rest in the glass draws out a faint balsamic vinegar note, and eventually seems to tame some of the weirdness, leaving pumpernickel bread and toffee.', ': Medium body, almost syrupy. Tongue burn is surprisingly moderate for something that’s nearly cask strength. Dark, brooding oaky tannins, dense burnt caramel, horehound (boiled hard candies) and ', ': Short. Shoe leather, balsamic vinegar, rosemary (??), and pine tar. A tinge of charcoal and then it fades rapidly, leaving only a remnant of dry oak.', ': A few drops of water bring back the crazy aromas, and also adds enough sweetness to really drive home the root beer notes. I recommend nosing this neat, and then again after a rest, and then add a little water and start over. The experience does change.', ': Whew, this one is all over the place.

354,Port Askaig 110 Proof ,"[': Ashy, meaty smoke reminds me of charred meat roasting over an open wood fire. Singed dry grasses (hay), like the scent of a distant wildfire. Dry malt, with a lot of nose tickle if you venture deeper into the glass. Some very faint vanilla.', ': Thin body. Robust tongue burn, in fact pretty fiery for a 55% which suggest the age might be on the shorter side (6 years is my wholly unsubstantiated guess). Dry on the tongue, with more charred meat and heavily toasted multigrain bread. ', ': Concentrated smoke, like bottled “liquid smoke” – almost verging on hickory. Fades without bitterness, and also without much dimension.', ': Several drops of water adds little, instead roughening up the nose tickle. The finish is a little better balanced, with some sweet malty notes to counter the dry smoke. I’d only bother with the water if you find the ABV too high to enjoy neat.', ': If $75 for a bottle of NAS Caol Ila at Cask Strength sounds appealing to you, go ahead and buy in.

The flavors then unfold as promised by the aroma – decadent caramelized sugars, gingerbread and spice cookies, candied nuts, and chewy nougat.', ': A hint of soot, a sparkle of sweet green barley, and a total lack of bitterness accompany the fading remnants of the palate notes. Turns drier as it departs, but without much tannin.', ': A few drops of water release a flurry of grassy notes, licorice (anise), black pepper.

356,Prichard’s Rye ,"[': A root beer float with vanilla ice cream. The rye spice notes are mellow and understated – instead of cinnamon red-hots and sharp star anise, there is a warm spice glow like mulled wine.

After a rest in the glass, I get a blast of coconut milk, cinnamon, honey-sweetened iced tea, and vanilla. In fact, it has all the ingredients of a chai latte. Several more minutes of resting benefits the dram significantly, revealing soft maltiness, subtle lemon, and sugary vanilla icing.', ': A torrent of coconut and spice is followed by mouth-numbing concentrations of alcohol. When the haze clears, I get warm notes of brown sugar, caramel macchiato, a metallic twinge of copper (like licking an old penny), and a peppery herbal twist.', ': Mildly bitter, and of medium length. The coconut shows itself and fades, followed by black pepper, almond skins, vanilla saltwater taffy, and finally some charred oak.', ': Water brings out the sweetest notes in the nose – mostly vanilla ice cream and processed (white) sugar. It does the same to the palate – softening the rougher edges of the alcohol. It makes the dram sweeter and easier to drink (a plus), but reduces the complexity and totally washes out the coppery oily meaty notes (a minus). Your choice!', ': A powerhouse dram of Irish whiskey that’s more Flogging Molly than The Irish Rovers. At once hectic and well-packaged, it demonstrates the intense concentration of flavor possible at cask strength while also showcasing the finer notes of damn fine pot-still Irish whiskey. If single-malt scotch is a refined sporting gentleman, this dram is a bare-knuckle boxing Irish dockworker with a dozen pints in him. If you like Redbreast 12, you’ll like this better.

Not bitter.', ': Water adds more nose tickle than I like.

Some vanilla sweetness and coconut water, tame tongue burn, and a dry austere nuttiness, like unsalted raw almonds. Fresh, though.

Gone in an instant.', ': A few drops of water seem to dampen the aroma, and also increase the nose tickle (it wasn’t noticeable before). The palate is a bit washed-out. At 40%, this needs no additional water.', ': I mean, it’s OK. A very standard Highland malt from a very standard (likely refill) combination of sherry and ex-bourbon casks. Even at 12 years of age it has little maturity or development and zero complexity. The only off-note is the bitterness on the finish, but it’s not balanced by any interesting characteristics.

A reprise of the butter toffee and finishes nicely with a very pleasant frosted cinnamon-bun flavor.', ': Several drops of water wake up the nose a bit, but fail to change the component aromas or overall balance. The palate seems a little thicker, but more muddled. The finish is tarter, and there’s more rye-delivered cinnamon and clove notes, which also come across when this is used to make cocktails. Water (or ice) totally optional when sipping.', ': I can’t find much to recommend this over any other bourbon in a +/- $20 range. It’s better than your bottom-shelfers, but it suffers from a lack of robustness and an unfortunate leaning towards the “furniture polish” side of oakiness, rather than the “buttery sweet” side. The rest of my bottle made a series of totally acceptable Old Fashioneds, but then that’s pretty much true of any bourbon over $20 a bottle (and a few under that). If you’re a huge fan of Wild Turkey’s focus on cereal notes, you might consider this a worthwhile upgrade.']"
365,Ryan and Wood Straight Rye ,[]
366,Sagamore Spirit “Calvados Finish” Rye ,"[': Ah yes, no mistaking the calvados. Sticky dried apples, oaky brandy, and a smattering of rye spices. This smells exactly like mulled cider, if mulled cider were 101 proof. There is a lot of nose tickle, but the aromas are also robust and deep. ', ': Medium body. Sweet, with oaky vanilla, thick slices of dried apple, marshmallow, and a sachet of mulling spices. It tastes just what the aroma promised, and the tongue burn is moderate. Yum.', ': Medium-long. A little barrel char – slightly bitter – takes over, and the finish becomes dry. Ghosts of clove, cinnamon, cardamom, and a touch of anise (black licorice) linger.', ': A few drops of water refresh the aroma, which had been flagging after a rest in the glass. The water doesn’t, however, add anything new. The palate seems a little thinner. I would only suggest using water with this if it seems too hot to you, or if you want to experiment with the proof.', ': This is exactly what I thought I would be getting when I read the label. It uses Sagamore Spirit’s well-chosen and well-blended MGP rye as a kind of sweet-and-spicy canvas for the delectable apple notes from the apparently very active calvados cask. We’re not talking about a faint wisp of apple here. Apple is center-stage and unlike some cheaper apple brandies, the fruit comes through clear and concentrated.']"
367,Sagamore Spirit Cask Strength Rye ,"[': Cherry syrup with aromatic bitters. The deeper into the glass you go, the more the cherry turns sweet and syrupy, like a cordial. Rye spices (cinnamon, clove) are present but restrained. Almost-astringent wood extracts are prevalent, suggesting heavy oak influence.', ': Syrupy body. A strong tongue burn is accompanied by those heavy astringent oak flavors, along with mouth-drying tannins. After the burn, delectable cherry syrup returns, along with walnuts and some molasses-y wood sugars.', ': Medium length. The finish is true to the palate, with more of the same. There’s an additional note of balsamic vinegar but no other evolution. Fades without bitterness.', ': The addition of several drops of water initially release a pleasant maple sugar note and additional nuttiness (hazelnuts). The water also mutes the nose tickle a bit, making it easier to detect aromas. The palate also becomes silkier, and the burn is muted. I heartily suggest adding water to this. In fact, experiment with various amounts to see how it changes. When I proof it down to approximately 48% and then (important!) give it a brief rest in the glass, the aroma becomes far more floral and fruity, the liquid is easier to taste and has less overpowering oak, and there’s a new stone fruit (peach?) flavor on the tongue. Try it!', ': Straight out of the bottle, this seems to be ALL about the oak, with only passing reference to rye. The cherry notes are deep, dark, and very tasty, but there isn’t a lot of complexity otherwise. That said, this is one of the most reactive whiskies I’ve had to various amounts of water. It seems like each additional splash of water reveals different flavors. That’s where the complexity is hidden, you just have to do a little work to unlock it.']"
368,Sagamore Spirit Rye ,"[': Soft, grain-forward rye. Reminds me of ', ': Thin body. Tannic, with a lot of wood up front. Basically no tongue burn. The rye spices return, now accompanied by pliable fresh cinnamon sticks, dried cherries, and dark brown sugar. Tasty.', ': Of medium length. Spices, of course: rye to the end. The cherry notes verge a little close to cough syrup before fading.', ': Several drops of water increase the nose tickle but don’t seem to release new aromas. The water also seems to thin the body. I don’t think this rye needs water.', ': A very tasty rye with all of the classic elements of that grain. The spices are especially well-balanced because the grain notes are soft and rounded, so the spices complement them rather than standing out or tasting “spicy”. Basically no rough edges or off-notes. This “sweeter style” can be attributed to the blending in of low-rye (aka half corn) spirit.']"
369,Säntis Dreifaltigkeit (Cask Strength Peated) Single Malt Whisky ,"[': Smoke, in an umami, soy-sauce style. Toasted seaweed (Nori), smoked salmon, roasting meats, etc. Very savory, and very complex. Note that the peat is not strong or overwhelming, it’s simply the dominant note in a mildly-aromatic whisky.', ': Thin body. Not much tongue burn considering the high ABV. Much stronger smoke. Alderwood smoke, with a sweet edge. This takes like liquid smoked salmon, and not the weak grocery store salmon, no, this is a serious hot-smoked mess.', ': Guess what? Smoke. Slight charcoal, but not bitter. Mostly just a reprise of the salty-smoky notes from the aroma.', ': Water doesn’t seem to have an appreciable effect, aside from reducing the strength. Wholly optional.', ': Wow. This is the single strangest peated malt I’ve ever tasted. All of the peat notes are specifically and only related to salty smoked meats (salmon, barbecue, etc.) There is a hint of the ocean/seaweed, but the overall impression is of liquid smoked salmon. If that sounds good to you (it does to me!), then this is a Must Try. If it sounds gross, then by all means skip it. Also, you’re not alone: A quick perusal of online reviews show that this whisky is very polarizing, with a lot of “This is the worst whisky I’ve ever tasted” type of reviews, and also some very positive reviews. This is not your standard peated whisky, but it is an education. Alas, good luck finding a retailer… I found a Dutch whisky shop with this in stock, but it would have cost $89 in shipping to the US alone!']"
370,Sazerac Rye ,[]
371,Scapa (16 year) ,"[': Briny. Sugar cookies and vanilla saltwater taffy. Very floral – honeysuckle. Elegant. It rewards a lengthy pondering by evolving more depth – not so much new aromas. It definitely reminds one of the sea – briny air, seaweed washed up on shore, and driftwood drying in the sun.', ': Light in body and flavor, but focused – a nuttiness like salted cashews, and distinct vanilla and malt (which continues to show as sugar cookies and saltwater taffy).', ': Light and of medium length. Vanilla bean and fresh dairy cream. Elegant to the last, and devoid of bitterness.', ': A surge of banana (ugh), but that fades and reveals syrupy melted ice cream. Definitely try it with a few drops.', ': Quite good. Scapa is light in nature, but delivers surprisingly deep and complex variations on the theme. Not just vanilla, but rich, roasty vanilla. Not just taffy, but briny, homemade saltwater taffy. Not just a good sipping malt, but elegant and accomplished from nose to finish.']"
372,Sheep Dip ,"[': Astringent note of lemon furniture polish assaults the nose first, with a musty overtone. By God this actually smells like sheep dip (or more likely sheep as my memories of sheep-related smells are in the distant past). No, that’s not a good thing. Lanolin (another sheep-related smell) and dry fungal – almost sulfury – malt arrive next. A rest in the glass dissipates these, leaving some pretty standard ex-bourbon notes of light caramel, nougat, honey, and vanilla.', ': Thin-bodied. Sweet malty notes of caramel and toffee join black licorice and root beer after a short tongue burn.', ': Short. Licorice again, and a fading bitterness, including some oaky mouth-drying tannins. Fades without much else.', ': A few drops of water make the licorice/anise note more piercing, now smelling more like cardamom. Other than that, no change except for a slightly sweeter root beer note on the finish. I don’t see a reason to bother with water for this dram.', ': Boy howdy, those are some awful notes fresh out of the bottle. I highly recommend letting this one sit for a bit before getting it anywhere near your olfactory senses. Once you do though, you risk being thoroughly bored by this mediocre-at-best assortment of ex-bourbon malts. I can find nothing to recommend this particular blended malt, and the sheep association in the name does it no favors, ']"
373,SIA Blended Scotch ,"[': Honeysuckle, lavender, sprouted grains. Soft. Some light toffee. A bit grainy – a touch heavy-handed with the youngish grain? After a rest in the glass, there is a dose of crushed vanilla bean and the stuff in the center of Cadbury Creme Eggs.', ': Awesome creamy mouthfeel. Milky and very very soft. A feather-light alcohol burn (although overused, the word ‘smooth’ comes unbidden to mind). More sweet caramelized sugars, vanilla crème brûlée, and a little vodka.', ': Medium-long. Malted milk balls. Fades with marshmallow, apple juice, walnut skins, and marzipan.', ': Water brings more vanilla cake frosting to the nose, but flattens out the rest. If anything, it makes the palate sweeter – Mexican wedding cookies? I would say you can take or leave the water with this one. It certainly will support mixing in cocktails, especially at this proof.', ': This reminds me of ']"
374,Smokehead ,[]
375,Smooth Ambler Old Scout American Whiskey ,"[': Antiseptic up front, with high notes of mango, tutti-frutti, and “0% fruit juice” bottled fruit punch. A rest in the glass dissipates those antiseptic notes, leaving a nose-piercingly tart assortment of energetic fruits. The 99 proof strength does come through, so don’t stick your nose too far in the glass.', ': Thin body (strange for a “bourbon”). More fruit punch, with some corn syrup sweetness and processed candy flavors. Plastic-y.', ': Medium-long. Warming. Echoes of the omnipresent fruit, faint wood, and a tinge of menthol/mint at the end.', ': Several drops of water have little effect on the aroma. The water adds a little much-needed balance in the mouth, with a little more oaky/caramel sweetness and a suggestion of rye spices. Water is not needed here, but doesn’t hurt anything.', ': Uhh. What probably started out as decent 9 year-old MGP bourbon is ruined by the fake-fruit overly-young Tennessee whiskey. I don’t care that a rejuvenated cask was used, nor do I care about the lack of a “bourbon” label. I care about too-young whiskey being blended into a product to spread out stock or lower its price… especially when that price is still nosing above the magical $30 level. I’ve tasted ']"
376,Sonoma County Distilling Co. Cask Strength Bourbon No. 2 ,"[': Yuge! Big aromas of oily, grassy, farm-distilled whiskey. You can almost smell the big, clanky, greasy alembic still. Rough, but complex and challenging. As a wheated whiskey, the aroma skews towards molasses and green grass (a young high-rye whiskey would skew towards pine/eucalyptus) but there are unusual notes of resin, tobacco, and cocoa nibs. Obviously young, but characterful and interesting.', ': A wave of weird-but-good flavors greet the tongue: Chocolate. Coffee. A grassiness verging on peat. Banana. Then the 53% ABV burns a layer of skin off of the tongue. After the tears clear, individual notes of green grass, raw sugar cane, and ripe banana dominate.', ': Medium-short. A bit muddy. Dry. Oaky tannins dry the walls of the mouth, but no individual notes are distinguishable.', ': Several drops of water add a licorice note to the aroma, but tone down the other oily/industrial notes, leaving the grassy ones. The palate is less fiery (slightly). Very slightly. Ok it still hurts. Water optional here – I don’t think it adds anything of particular value, but you might desire to water it down to a more tolerable drinking proof. I won’t judge.', ': This reminds me a lot of ']"
377,Sonoma County Distilling Co. Cask Strength Cherrywood Rye ,"[': As a young rye, I expect grassiness and mint, eucalyptus, or pine notes. There is grassiness, but instead of pine I get a mild woodsmoke, cherry blossoms (ahh, the power of suggestion), heavy oak, and maraschino cherries. Potent, but not especially hot. There is also the required assortment of spices – mostly cinnamon here. ', ': Thin body. Tart cherries up front, followed by a heavy tongue burn. I can’t tell if the smoke is from the cherrywood or from my singed tastebuds, but smoke there is. Oaky tannins, vanilla, cherry syrup, and herbal grassiness (now there’s eucalyptus).', ': Medium-long. Some elements of cocktail bitters appear – bitter cherry and medicinal herbs – and burnt sugar or molasses. It does indeed taste somewhat like a high-proof smoked Manhattan.', ': A splash of water adds sooty smoke to the aroma, dulls the burn on the palate (a little), and maybe provides a touch more fruit on the tongue and finish. Water does not hurt, but if you paid for cask strength, you should at least try it at cask strength first.', ': A success. Unlike some fruitwood-smoked whiskies, this one is both heavily influenced by the cherrywood smoke and also fully in balance with it. The typical “young rye” grassy notes are present but very understated, the barrel proof provides just the right amount of oak, and the Manhattan-esque flavors feel emergent, not forced. There are a few rough edges, and I can’t help but wish for another two or three years in oak, but I’m happy with the purchase, and looking forward from more from the distillery.']"
378,Sonoma County Distilling Co. Single Barrel Rye ,"[': Sweet! fudgy (maple fudge or blonde fudge). Round, and not overtly “rye”… in other words there is no heavy vegetal, pine, or eucalyptus element, and the soft sweet notes take center stage. At cask strength, the aroma is strong and decadent, with no detracting qualities at all. Reminds me of all of the things I love about ', ': Thin body. Ahh! There’s the pine. It’s nicely balanced against caraway, lightly-sweet new oak (vanilla, brown sugar), and sweet cream. The tongue burn is intense. After it subsides, notes of juniper, hazelnut, rose water, and nougat pervade.', ': Long. Some elements from the aroma return (maple fudge) as well as from the palate (nougat). This fades without bitterness.', ': A couple of drops of water reveal more vegetal (pine/juniper) notes in the aroma. The tongue burn is lessened, however, and may be a tad sweeter. Water is optional with this one.', ': I’m very curious if the successes of this rye translate to the regular batched versions of the distillery’s ryes, or if this particular cask was stand-out. The fudgey, round, flawless façade of the aroma contrasts nicely with the grain-forward-but-complex flavors on the tongue. The finish is basic, but doesn’t detract. Overall, this is a highly successful craft rye for a highly craft price. If you live in the area or plan to visit Sonoma, at least visit the distillery.']"
379,Sons of Liberty: Battle Cry ,"[': Honey-sweet, with milk chocolate, oatmeal cookies, and heavy oaky vanilla. There are bourbon-like charcoal notes, but the balance is between malty cereal notes (like a Speyside single malt) and big oak-derived aromas.', ': Heavy bodied, with a few nutty flavors (toasted almonds) and more malty grains. Some marshmallow, and a heavy dose of oaky tannins. A bit of clove. Very bourbon-like.', ': Medium-long. Candy-corn (honey), toasted oats, stale spices (clove, nutmeg), fading with marshmallow and a dark cacao nibs.', ': A few drops of water wake up some vegetal notes – menthol or eucalyptus primarily – making this suddenly smell like a young straight rye. The palate is a little thinner, but the finish is more lively and almost has a bare hint of tropical fruit (green banana). A little water’s not a bad idea with this one.', ': This drinks like liquid oatmeal cookies. A nice balance of clear-cut cereal grains with (almost) heavy-handed new oak. Like most American single-malts, this is more like bourbon than scotch, certainly because of the use of new charred oak. That said, this one stands out in the crowd due to its spot-on cereal notes, which could be because of the attention paid to the wort/wash. Currently, Sons of Liberty products are only available in the US Northeast. Here’s hoping their distribution becomes wider!', ': Wash tasting.']"
380,Sons of Liberty: Hop Flavored Whiskey (Seasonal) ,"[': Piercing notes of grapefuit juice, pine sap, and orange peel. Very perfumed, with fruits and florals in dizzying number. Not particularly bitter (yet), but very strongly reminiscent of the scent of a freshly-poured draft IPA. The whisky notes are overshadowed by the hops, but there is a biscuity, fruitcake-like depth to the aroma.', ': Sweet. Medium-bodied, with hops notes that are at first strongly bitter, and then calm down and become familiar – pine resin, lemon peel. There is a slight undercurrent of pale malt and vanilla, but as an afterthought.', ': On the short side. Surprisingly not bitter. Some of the fruit notes linger, becoming jammy. Fades with pine, lemon.', ': Oddly, a few drops of water seem to mute the hop notes, leaving not a whole lot behind. I would definitely not add any water to this. Out of curiosity, I tried a dram of this on ice and found the same thing – the hop notes are very muted and without them, there isn’t much else going on. I would either drink this neat or use it to create a subtly hop-infused whiskey cocktail.', ': There is no question that the hop character is fully and prominently displayed, with all of the full range of hop-derived flavors and aromas but amplified and carried by the alcohol, to the point that the whiskey itself is little more than a vehicle for the distilled, concentrated essence of IPA. Surely this was the point, and it’s one of the more successful flavored whiskies I’ve tasted. I’m very glad that the “flavoring” of this whisky is restricted to the use of hops, rather than the type of sugar-laden syrup that other flavored whiskies suffer from. I suggest that if you come across a bottle of this and you’re a fan of hoppy beer that you buy it just for the novelty of it. You won’t be disappointed by the quality, even if you’re not really sure what to do with a hop-flavored “whiskey”!']"
381,Sons of Liberty: Uprising ,"[': Drier than ', ': Thick bodied. Again, heavy roasty notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Heavy dark bread (pumpernickel). Dusty. Toasted walnuts. After awhile, there’s a note of cinnamon and vanilla, like Mexican-style hot chocolate.', ': Medium-short. Crunchy dark chocolate-covered coffee beans, and a slight bitterness like strong brewed coffee. Fades quickly.', ': A few drops of water seem not to affect the aroma, but thin the palate. As with Battle Cry, the finish is a bit livelier, with a hint of that cherry coming through, but I wouldn’t bother with water with this one.', ': This is good, but not quite as successful (for me) as Battle Cry, which is better balanced. That said, Uprising is true to its roots, with very clear roasty notes of coffee and dark chocolate, just like you’d expect in a stout beer. There is not quite enough sweetness to balance the bitter, nor quite enough malty cereal notes or fruit to balance the heavy toast of the malt. I’m also missing the new oak, which is probably hiding beneath those coffee notes.', ': Wash Tasting.']"
382,Speyburn (10 year) ,"[': Yeasty. A sour note – like young white wine. A hefty dose of vanilla. More character than the younger Bradan Orach. After a rest in the glass, it becomes more overtly floral.', ': Creamy texture. A wave of vanilla bean up front, subsiding to reveal soft grains, sugar cookies, and… well, that’s it.', ': Short. The wine flavor returns – here grape skins – with a slight tannic quality. Not particularly bitter, but there is a dry “vodka-esque” note on the fade-out.', ': A few drops of water draw out a little sweetness in the nose, and a larger dose of florals. The mouthfeel suffers a little, but that sweetness continues on through the finish. A few drops of water are a good idea with this dram.', ': This is a step up from the NAS release Bradan Orach in both potency and quality. There’s nothing here to warrant recommending this bottle over any other similar Highland malt, which sounds like a criticism, except that Speyburn is wisely priced to compete not against other, better, single malts, but instead against inexpensive – and abrasive – blends. While it could be argued that some of the better $20 blends are superior, it’s impossible to argue that this isn’t a great value. If you’re trying to decide between Speyburn 10 and Bradan Orach, know that for $3 to $5 more, the 10-year is about 50% better. Also, Speyburn, nice move bottling this at 43% ABV. That extra potency shows.']"
383,Speyburn Bradan Orach ,"[': Malty caramel and a distinct green apple note. A tad yeasty. There is no denying the youth of this vatting from the aroma, but the effect is not off-putting or overly harsh. Deeper in there is a hint of vanilla. After a rest in the glass, the nose gets a little thin.', ': Thin body – almost watery. Moderate tongue burn. Sour apple, unripe cherries, sugar cookie, and a slight tannic woodiness. The flavors are skewed towards the sour in an “unripe” way. Alas, too dry to be well-balanced.', ': Short. Sparse, but slightly sweet, like a touch of honey in green tea. Not bitter, but there is a fading sense of grassiness.', ': A few drops of water release a ghost of barley grains on the nose, and add ever so little sweetness on the tongue. Unfortunately, you pay for it with a distinct acetone note on the finish. Euchh.', ': The nose is gentle and expressive for such an undoubtedly young vatting. The body and finish don’t quite live up to the promise. A bit more sweetness or roundness on the palate would warrant a higher rating, although it would probably be more expensive if that were the case. It’s pretty hard to pass judgement on a $15 whisky. It’s certainly not bad, and is almost (almost) as good as the relatively pricier ']"

385,"Springbank (10 year), Revisited ","[': Green apple, lime juice, juicy green pear. Delectable, but with limited peat presence.', ': Thin but silky body. Mild tongue burn. Drying vegetal (grassy) tannins with a bit of resinous (piney) peat. The overall impression is still fruity. Some charcoal.', ': A lot of charcoal, but not too bitter. Green apple skins. Cucumber water. Fades quickly, but lingers with that pine-flecked peat.', ': A few drops of water brighten up the aroma but don’t add anything new. Palate texture is unaffected, although the burn is tamed. Water optional.', ': A very tasty, mild-peated malt with a surprising amount of fruit. Very well-balanced. I wish other single malts had this kind of balance and quality at 10 years of age.']"
386,Springbank (15 year) ,"[': Much clearer sherry character than the younger expressions. Here, though, it is heavily sulfurous – of the “rotten eggs” variety – to the point of distraction. There is some typical sooty Springbank peat and doughy malt behind the sherry, but without the stage presence of the ', ': Thin-bodied. Peat-forward, with soot, char, and jam. Hot for 46%. The sulfur peeks through in places.', ': Earthy, with charry peat and lingering mixed fruits (Cherry? Berry jam?). Fades with dried cranberries and vague peat.', ': Water – God help me – only intensifies the sulfur.', ': It’s really hard for me to speak intelligently about this Springbank when the only olfactory memory in my head is that of a composting outhouse I once experienced that smelt strongly of sulfur. You hear of whisky smells transporting you to places and times … that can also work to the detriment of the imbiber, it appears, as I am transported by this whisky back to that one particular outhouse. This is, after hundreds of whiskies, the first time I’ve really been affected by sulfur notes in a whisky. This one is bad, though. I would return this bottle if I had purchased it for any price.']"

Cherry liqueur again, plus lemon verbena, black tea, bittersweet cocoa, and faint green tobacco. Finishes abruptly without evolving.', ': A few drops of water seem to dull the aroma, and brings nothing new to the palate. Don’t bother with water here.', ': A distinct and utter pleasure. St. George is adept at using a canvas of familiar-but-mysteriously-different malt and painting a masterpiece of fruits and flowers and sweets through the use of various casks. While it has a number of scotch-like attributes, it ends up tasting undeniably of St. George, and distinctly non-Scottish. I cannot get over how perfumed the aroma is, with a fruit-and-flowers intensity that I rarely encounter in a whisky of any nationality.']"
390,Stagg Jr. Batch #9 ,"[': Plum wine and cherry jam. Chewy dark chocolate-covered cherries and ', ': Thin body. Burns like vengeance. Burns like a woman’s scorn. Burns like a solar coronal mass ejection. What’s left of my taste buds emerge, battle-scarred veterans, to detect cherry juice, pomegranate, and antique oak furniture polish.', ': Long. More fruit but masked by a hazy wood smoke. A little drier now, with cocoa nibs and coffee grounds. Fades with bittersweet chocolate and a tinge of salted caramels.', ': Oh God yes, give me water. A hearty splash of water initially mutes the aroma, and then reveals a little peanut butter and chocolate. My mouth still burns like Old Testament fire and brimstone… consider that you would need to drown this in water to get it anywhere near an easily-drinkable 50% ABV.', ': Holy Hand Grenade, this is a bourbon for the ages. Everything I like about bourbon – big wood, big fruit, big spices – served up at a white-hot 65.95% ABV. I have exactly no bad things to say about this bourbon, except that I am physically unable to fill my cabinet with bottles of it due to limited inventory, and the next batch may or may not meet my now-lofty expectations. This is definitely a challenge to drink, and fits the classical definition of “too hot”. If avoiding alcohol burn is high on your list you should probably avoid this one (just like ']"

The malt is present, but in the background: providing a floor of malty sweetness and a mild nutty grain note. Pleasant and aromatic. A rest in the glass adds more sweetness, and a layer of cake frosting.', ': Thin, and very tannic body. Instantly mouth-drying. The tongue burn is negligible, almost nonexistent. A reprise of the aroma notes – red berries, port wine, and balsamic vinegar with a vague malt/grain backdrop.', ': Of medium length. A surprising dark chocolate note appears, which is downright delectable next to all that port and balsamic. The finish is very tannic, very mouth-drying. It doesn’t evolve much, but with that lovely chocolate note it doesn’t need to.', ': Now that chocolate is in my head, it’s all I can smell. The water might have revealed it, or my brain did. The water might be picking out a few extra fruit notes: kiwi fruit, coconut water. I suggest trying this without water and then with just a few drops to see how it changes for you.', ': I’m very happy with this dram. The price is acceptable, considering how far it has to travel to reach shelves near me. The flavors are competent and even exciting in places, and there are no off-flavors. It has a very successful sweet-dry balance, and the red wine barrel components are shockingly well-adapted (which is rare, especially considering the full-term maturation in red wine casks). If you’ve never had whisky from the region, Starward Nova is downright the easiest way to do so, and it’s tasty to boot.']"

The finish is unchanged. Water optional, but use very sparingly.', ': It starts promisingly, with full honey notes and a stable of floral notes that compares favorably with similar styles like The Balvenie. The dimensions begin to fall away on the tongue, and into a disappointing finish. Still, a very drinkable easy-going malt with few overt flaws.

The nose tickle is mild, despite being nearly 120 proof.', ': Medium body. Initially sweet and bready, and overlain with those same salty, peppery maritime notes from the aroma. Tongue burn is robust, as expected. As the reader who sent me this commented: “If you want to know how big a man you are, drink cask-strength Talisker.” Cue the poetry. Vikings and stuff. Eventually I’m able to regain my composure and I can taste pepper jelly, barbecue char, hay, and tobacco.', ': Long. Dry, with more of that pepper-and-salt combination. The peat smoke is present, but not in the foreground. Fades pretty much as it started, and without bitterness.', ': Several drops of water releases a deluge of meaty notes. Uncured bacon, smoked pork shoulder, my favorite salt-and-pepper brisket rub, etc. The tongue burn is just as epic, but there are now additional flavors: green chili, nori, and smoked salmon. Definitely try this with water, it’s a different – and complementary – experience.', ': I’m not really sure what to say. This is exactly what I’d expect Talisker 10 to taste like if you just removed the water. It burns like Hellfire, but retains 100% of its identity. If I had to nitpick, I’d say it doesn’t bring anything new to the party unless you add a little water, and then that effect is fleeting. I agree with another comment from our generous reader, though, that Talisker 8 at 46% would probably satisfy about the same as Talisker 10 does, if this bottling is any guide. Just don’t tell Diageo that.']"

The pot-still rum cask comes through clearly, with characteristic funky banana, coconut, molasses, and vegetal sugar cane. Oddly, the sum of these has subsumed all of the classic Talisker peat. Even after a rest in the glass, the peat/smoke remains in the background.', ': Syrupy body. There’s the peat! Holy firecrackers there’s a ton of smoke and an avalanche of briny, peppery peat. The tongue burn is as expected for this high ABV. There’s also barrel char, shortbread cookies, and salted caramel, but not a lot of rum notes.', ': Long. The party resumes on the finish, which brings the joy of windswept, rocky Talisker peat together with a bubbling pot of Caribbean funk. There’s only just barely enough sweetness from the rum to compete with the smoke. The finish is quite long, and it evolves a little by adding spearmint, carob, and burnt caramel. A journey.', ': A few drops of water warm up the aroma, adding toasty oak notes and waking up a little smoke. The rum funk is less obvious, though. The palate and finish seem largely unchanged by this small amount of water. Water optional, I’m not sure this needs it unless you’re having trouble with the high ABV.', ': What an oddball. The aroma is so decked out in Caribbean funk it feels like it should have a little umbrella sticking out of the glass, but the palate is pure unadulterated hurricane-force salt spray in your face. The finish is a little of both. An experience… it took several tastings to just make sense of what was going on in the glass. I’m calling it a “Must Try” although it’s quite pricey. If you have a chance to try a glass, don’t pass it up. If you’re already a Talisker fiend, you probably don’t need me to tell you it’s worth the money, which is even higher than last year. Ah! I found the fourth Horseman of the Whisky Apocalypse: Inflation!']"
398,Talisker 57° North ,"[': Nutmeg! A barrage of white pepper, nutmeg, smoked salt, burning incense sticks, salted caramel, and salmon jerky. There’s a lot of complexity packed into this little bundle. It definitely delivers on the promise of Talisker peat, plus a little something extra.', ': Thin body. Serious tongue burn (of course), with attendant smoke coming out of my ears. When the fury subsides, there is fresh (spicy) ginger, cracked black pepper, and a sensation of salty sea breezes.', ': Medium-Long. The peat makes a comeback, with plenty of brushfire smoke, residual brine, and only a faint touch of sweetness. A bit of mouth-drying tannin. Not a lot of bitterness.', ': Normally a dram is better when it’s cohesive, but here I find the opposite. The separate, independent notes of aroma create a chaotic jumble that very much works. When I add (a little) water, it becomes more cohesive and loses something – becoming muddied. The palate becomes markedly sweeter. If I add enough water to proof it down to around 50%, there’s a significant smoked fish element to the aroma. Also adds dried lemon peel and gingerbread (??) to the palate. I would only add water to proof it down if you aren’t enjoying it straight at full proof.', ': Well, that’s Talisker all right. A big, brutish dram with most of the complexity on the nose. It definitely delivers everything you’d expect from nearly-cask-strength Talisker. If you’re already a Talisker fan, then you’re ready to try this. If you’re not a Talisker fan, get comfortable with the standard ']"
399,Talisker Distillers Edition (2013) ,"[': Exactly what you think it will smell like. Salty, briny, chalky Talisker, complete with briny, seaweed-flecked peat smoke, layered with a blanket of soft red fruits and raisin-y sherry. Some decadent vanilla (like melted ice cream) underlies the two. A rest in the glass improves the integration of these contrasting aromas.', ': Talisker’s signature briny peat hits the tongue first, evoking seaspray and driftwood campfires, and the taste of dried saltwater on your lips. This is immediately followed by a wave of jammy sherry, nougat, and grilled fruit (are grilled plums a thing?).', ': Long. Again, the two halves of the experience fade in tandem, both raisin-y and smoky, sweet and peat, at the end showing a final oaky drying tannin.', ': A few drops of water dampen the peat, and release a fog of vanilla. I’d skip the water.', ': A satisfying experience. If you like Talisker (but are not some raving peat purity nut), you are likely to enjoy Talisker sweetened and contrasted with this particular sherry. The pliability of the jammy flavors yield to the harder, aggressive smoke notes, but are not overwhelmed. The smoke, luckily, does not appear to be diminished. This is like seeing a tough, intimidating, macho, alpha male friend petting a froofy dog. The softer side of Talisker, if you will, and one of the relatively few successful marriages of peat and wine that I’ve had. (My recent bottle of ']"
400,Talisker Port Ruighe ,"[': Aroma is quintessential Talisker seaspray-flecked smoke, black pepper and butterscotch saltwater taffy. After some coaxing, there is a hint of dark chocolate and, at a stretch, raspberry coulis. Blind, I would say this is just regular ', ': Syrupy body. Very hot, at first, but resolves slowly into heavy notes of rhubarb, smoked salt, earthy peat, and caramel malt. The port is more readily detectable here, with light red fruits and a slight tartness.', ': Very long. Talisker again, with more briney driftwood smoke and deep-earth peat. Drying, with flecks of minerals and some solid oak tannin. Fades with a whisper of tannic grape skins.', ': A few drops of water have no apparent effect on the aroma. The tongue burn is significantly tamed, however, and there’s a sense of bakery treats (scones or something) that wasn’t as easy to detect without the water. The finish might be slightly fruitier, with some berry flavors. Try without and then with water.', ': Solid, respectable, but not all that different from Talisker Distiller’s Edition, with the same “Talisker plus something fruity” profile. Unlike some wine-finished whiskies, which take on the worst aspects of the wine and lose some of their own identity in the process, this is Talisker through-and-through, with a little top dressing of tart red fruits. A value-add, anyway, and not outrageously priced.']"
401,Talisker Storm ,"[': Definitely Talisker DNA: savory smoke, brine, and black pepper. The smoke is oddly more evident away from the glass – inside the glass the smoke becomes delicate and is overshadowed by unusually sweet malt. This results in the strange sensation of appreciating the aroma more above the glass than in it. The un-Talisker sweetness in question is a combination of shortbread cookies, honey, apple juice, and pancake syrup (not maple).', ': Medium bodied, not quite syrupy. Mild tongue burn. I’m used to being punched in the face, metaphorically speaking, by Talisker distillate. This feels more like a delicate caress. The brine is there, as is the black pepper, and the peat evolves properly across the tongue, starting smoky and ending earthy. Still, the usual Talisker-ness is missing, replaced by a parody. A sweet one.', ': Medium-Long, but doesn’t linger quite like the 10 year. Again, there is an odd candy-like sweetness that accompanies the briny smoke, turning what should be an experience of seaspray on an unforgiving rocky coastline into… a sputtering candy-scented gift candle. Fades with more of the same.', ': A few drops of water tame the sweetness on the aroma and bring out some lemon peel. The palate is brighter and has more tart high notes, which makes it less cloying. I highly recommend a little water with this.', ': I see what the detractors are saying. This is Talisker, but it feels like Talisker invaded by a troupe of Care Bears, which have turned the crusty old seafarer into a dancing cartoon version of itself. I find this to be sweeter and less smoky than ']"
402,Tamdhu (10 year) ,"[': Pungent sherry. Orange oil, funky dried fruits, and sticky toffee pudding. A lot of aroma without much nose tickle. An undercurrent of malty caramel. Sweet, but not cloying. A lot of depth here.', ': Orange marmalade. More funky dried fruit – prunes and apricots – with a layer of chocolate malt. Not as much depth here, but very well balanced and flavorful.', ': Medium long. Orange creme popsicle. Slightly bitter – mostly in an orange peel kind of way. Mildly oaky. Fades with a hint of hazelnut and more orange peel.', ': A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma, and wash out the palate. I wouldn’t say this malt needs any water.', ': This is like a love-child between ']"
403,Tamdhu (12 year) ,"[': Delectable, fruity aroma with a lot of both fresh and dried/jammy fruits: blackberry, pear, fig, raisin, red currant, and red apples. Under all the fruit there is a layer of pound cake and butterscotch. A rest in the glass reveals a mild tart vinegar note, like sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar. Polished… downright elegant.', ': Moderate, nearly syrupy body. On the tongue, the fruits turn predominantly dried: prune, raisin, fig cake, berry jam. There is quite a lot of oak, with barrel char that is almost smoky and tannic, slightly astringent oak that starts to dominate. The grain is very much in the background, overshadowed by the oak and dried fruits.', ': Medium length. Charcoal again, with surprisingly little of the fruit notes carrying through. Mouth-drying oak tannins, slightly bitter barrel char, and a tinge of menthol on the tail end.', ': A few drops of water increase the nose tickle without adding much else. The water brightens up the fruit on the palate, though, and adds a layer of malty sweetness that was lacking. The finish also picks up a tart note. Water is a great idea with this one.', ': This has an excellent aroma, and a decently well-balanced array of flavors on the tongue. However, it starts to disappoint on the finish, which is where it falls down against classic sherry bombs like ']"
404,Tamnavulin Double Cask ,"[': Meaty, nutty, and malty. Deep, oily notes of beeswax and coconut butter. The oily toasted nut aroma almost reminds me of ghee. The sherry notes are very faint – mostly adding the nuttiness and a faint suggestion of dates or prunes.', ': Thin body. The tongue burn is almost nonexistent. There is a hint of smoke, like smoked salt, but mostly it’s all about toasted nuts, dates, and chewy buttery toffee.', ': Medium-long. Those same aroma notes are back with a vengeance – deep and robust buttery flavors continue through the finish, along with toasted nuts and a bit of port wine. This evolves slightly, adding black licorice before fading.', ': A few drops of water add a little sweetness – which wasn’t lacking – but amps up the tongue burn. It also adds a bit of menthol to the finish. Maybe try it without water first, and then add a little to see what it does for you.', ': Very lovely and unexpectedly deep flavors. The butter is what gets me – that’s not something I normally find in a whisky. It reminds me a bit of ']"
405,Té Bheag ,"[': A *strong* whiff of Iodine, with a savory undertone – like soy sauce or Thai fish sauce (but not fishy). There’s also a layer of industrial oils, which reminds me of Springbank. An unusual grain profile, suggesting quinoa or oats or something.', ': Silky, syrupy body. Slightly sweet on the outset, with a hint of peat (or maybe that’s the iodine again) after awhile. Some barrel char on the mid-palate, and a few baking spices (anise, cardamom especially). Remains sweet in a cereal way, but not particularly fruity.', ': Medium-long. A slight oiliness and a hint of toasted coconut. Meaty and not bitter. Fades with the coconut.', ': A few drops of water make the nose sweeter, which now definitely smells like Thai fish sauce. Palate/finish unchanged.', ': I quite like it, although the savory/iodine on the nose is teetering on the edge of “rotting meat” without quite falling over. There’s a good, heavy body, a lot of complexity, and interesting coconut, all of which are things that I like about Redbreast and (sort of) Springbank. If you can find it and you like a little peat in your blended scotch, this is definitely worth investigation.']"

407,Teeling Revival (15 year) Irish Single Malt Whiskey ,"[': Dripping with rum notes (vegetal sugar cane fibers, molasses, raw cane juice) and tropical fruits (kiwi, orange peel, pineapple), and a touch of menthol, there is still a layer of barley grain under all of the adornments. Very nice.', ': Syrupy body. Passionfruit up front, with bubble gum (tutti-frutti), cane sugar, and fruit punch. Light tongue burn, but no further development.', ': Medium-long. More fruits, now accompanied by tropical flowers, usher out the finish. No off notes.', ': A few drops of water initially mute the aroma, requiring a rest. The water does seem to perk up the fruity notes and adds a bit of nondescript perfume. Water optional, but the whiskey can handle it.', ': A pleasure. This is what ']"
408,Teeling Single Grain Irish Whiskey ,"[': Young, fresh fruit notes of green apple, kiwi, and grape jam. Light but sweet vanilla frosting, and only a faint “vodka” note (acetone). Light, sweet, and clean. A rest in the glass reveals a note of coconut water.', ': Soft and syrupy body. Low burn. Tons of coconut up front. Faint grape but without any red wine tannin. Simple syrup. Not much else.', ': Of medium length. Continues with coconut, now toasty, and fades without bitterness and only a very slight vodka/acetone note.', ': A few drops of water muddy the aroma a bit, muting the tart fruit notes and revealing only a vague cereal element. No water needed here.', ': Surprisingly good, if somewhat one-dimensional. The red wine cask might be adding some of the fruit elements, but is very much in the background (a blessing, for a red wine cask). Unctuous sweet coconut notes dominate the palate and are balanced by light tart fruit notes only in the aroma. A pleasant but unchallenging drink. I marked it “Recommended” mostly due to its price-drinkability ratio. If listed for very much above $40 I would think twice.']"
409,Teeling Single Malt Irish Whiskey ,"[': Green, vegetal. Reminds me of aloe vera. Not sweet – only some faint vanilla and pale malt. Shy – I really have to dig around in the glass for the aroma. After a rest in the glass… more of the same.', ': Thin bodied. Some elegant vanilla bean and fresh cream up front is followed by a brief tongue burn. Next, a high note of kiwi or starfruit which I recognize from ', ': Short. Some of that tropical fruit shows through, along with a hint of menthol. Very nice.', ': A few drops of water do absolutely nothing for the aroma. Skip the water here, let that 46% ABV shine.', ': A bit of a contradiction. The aroma is – to put it mildly – bad. An unpromisingly bland vegetable quality that even a few drops of water can’t improve. On the tongue, however, the malt comes alive with rare fruits and a continuous evolution that continues through the end of the finish. This is a bit like ']"
410,Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey ,"[': Rum for sure. Raw cane juice and golden rum dominate the aroma. Underneath, there is a very, very light Irish whiskey – passive and apologetic in nature. One could even be forgiven for guessing this was gold rum in a blind tasting.', ': Now the grain steps forward. Hay and oatmeal, lightly sweet. The burn is a bit intense for this low ABV. After, some coconut and vanilla emerge, and the cane juice reasserts itself.', ': Medium long. Caramel hard candies. Vanilla bean, and rum cake. Not bitter.', ': A few drops of water reveal something lightly floral. The tongue burn on the palate is lessened, and the body is a bit thicker. A few drops of water aren’t a bad idea with this one.', ': Huh. The nose is a disappointing takeover of rum, leaving little trace of whiskey. The palate is more in line with what I expected, but the lightness in flavor leads me to believe that the malt component of the blend is small, and the rum is meant to understudy in the role of flavor. The overall effect is of one of those flavored whiskeys hitting the market, where the transparent marketing leads us to believe that taking sub-par whiskey and flavoring it with something sugary is an acceptable business practice. This is a few steps above that, but I would have much preferred something with real Irish character. Here’s hoping that the Teeling Whiskey Company can stay afloat until it begins distilling something it can be proud of.']"
411,Templeton Rye ,"[': Subdued. Nutty, with a soft nougat/caramel initial note. Not a lot of rye spices, but also no grassy/piney notes. Just somewhat sweet and somewhat oaky.', ': Soft, almost syrupy body. A repeat of the nutty nougat and sweet caramel notes. Very low tongue burn. And… that’s it.', ': Medium length. A one-trick pony, it appears. The same two notes continue through the finish. At least it’s consistent. Fades slowly with a hint of menthol.', ': A few drops of water wake up a slight nose tickle but with no added aroma notes. The palate seems watered-down by even a few drops. The finish is a little livelier and introduces a bit of lemon zest. Water optional, and not really recommended due to its effect on the palate.', ': I wouldn’t have thought a whiskey distantly associated with a made-up story about Al Capone would be such a snooze. On one hand, it’s easy-drinking to a fault and pleasantly sweet and consistent all the way through. On the other hand, there’s very little going on here. This is especially odd for a rye, a grain known for eccentricity. It’s also essentially the same thing as ']"
412,The Arran Malt – Sauternes Cask Finish ,"[': A deep, dripping, pungent plume of honey, honeycomb (wax), and real wax candles meets the nose. Deeper in the glass is a solid base of cakey shortbread and banana custard. Oddly despite all the sweet treats, the scent isn’t overly sweet or cloying. A rest in the glass reveals some fresh green banana and kiwi. A beautiful aroma.', ': Medium-bodied, slightly syrupy. Moderate tongue-burn, which recedes slowly. In its wake are cinnamon candies, honey in various forms, and coconut extract. Golden raisins (sultanas), sugar cookies, and lemon curd on scones round out the palate.', ': Somewhat short, but warming. Initially, a burst of white wine reduction gives a nice balance of sweet and sour, but this is soon replaced with hints of bitter barrel char, burnt caramel, and grape skins (although without much tannin). Fades quickly with a slight nuttiness.', ': Several drops of water sweeten and complicate the nose, bringing vague florals and concentrated summer fruits, plus a much-appreciated tart note (green apple, kiwi, or something) to balance the sweet. The palate is more accommodating, and retains some of that tartness. I highly recommend a few drops of water with this one, and even suggest experimenting with watering it down around 43% to see how it changes.', ': That nose! Wow. I could sniff this all day long. The palate comes across as a bit hot, even for 50% ABV, but does fulfill the promise of the nose, with honey and bakery goods and faint dried fruits. The same is true of the surprisingly short finish, this dram’s one weak spot. As mentioned above, a little water brings the whole glass into better balance and heightens the good while muting the bad. This is one of the few drams I’ve had recently that justifies its price. Well done.']"
413,The Arran Malt (10 year) ,"[': Green apple. Light raisins. Tart raspberry. Pomegranate. Intriguing set of fruits on the nose – good tartness and nice, if light, complexity.', ': Creamy! Nice texture. Tartness. Some dried citrus notes – remind me of The Dalmore. There’s a good bit of complexity on the tongue, where some malts just get washed out by the alcohol.', ': Orange peel. Not bitter! On the short side. Some warm cereal sugars.', ': Sweeter on the nose, more malt sugar, but some oaky bitterness appears on the finish.', ': Great value! You could do a lot worse with $45. The mature lack of bitterness plus interesting tartness in the nose and on the palate is a winning combination. This is the sort of malt that you’ll try as a novelty, and then come back to for its quality. Score another one for the little independent distilleries!']"

Becomes more tart towards the end.', ': Medium-long. Some tartness, with sour cherries and pie filling. No bitterness! Nice balance between oaky caramel and dried fruit.', ': Good whisky on its own, but in comparison to the 10 year it’s mostly a novelty. If you love Arran 10, you’ll obviously enjoy Arran 14. If you’re looking for a deal like the 10 year, though, you won’t find it here. This price point means it’s competing with the likes of Lagavulin 16, the better Glenmorangies, and a whole swathe of stand-out malts in the 14-17 age range. This particular bottle just doesn’t stand up to the competition, and probably should be $10 to $15 cheaper.']"

After a rest in the glass, it acquires some faint citrus notes – bergamot? or maybe just lemon. The usual Balvenie florals are absent.', ': Somewhat watery. Tame on the tongue – “smooth” is, I suppose, the word to use here – a decent balance of toffee, citrus lozenge, and fresh white dinner rolls.', ': Equally tame, and of short length. No bitterness, which I appreciate, and the toffee continues. Pleasant, but not exceptional.', ': Water increases the yeast component on the nose in exchange for… mmm, nope, that’s it. Predictably, water further dilutes that already diluted palate, but somehow activates something that increases tongue burn. It does give an additional caramel note on the finish, but at too high a cost. Skip the water.', ': Uhh. This costs how much? No wonder it was discontinued. With about a quarter of the character of the 12-year DoubleWood, and about a third of the complexity of the 15-year Single Barrel, this is one lame duck of a whisky. While newbies will appreciate its smoothness on the tongue and its lack of bitter notes on the finish, there is little to recommend it in terms of flavor. A pity, since Balvenie is one of my favorite distilleries. I cannot recommend this release, and it’s just as well that it’s been discontinued. Get a bottle of the ']"

Fresh coconut meat, caramel oak, buttery malt, and pound cake.', ': On the short side. Oaky and malty with only a hint of fruit (fruit punch). Some oak barrel tannin, but not drying. Missing something.', ': Several drops of water (I wanted to drown it) add a nice layer of vanilla to the bubble gum and fruit on the nose. The palate is noticeably calmer, and contains a little fruit this time. The finish is also improved, with a rummy caramel and some fading menthol. Totally add water to this and don’t skimp.', ': Ok this is a weird one. It has one of the most intensely fruity aromas I’ve come across with a delectable assortment of tropical fruits. This is followed by a blisteringly mouth-numbing alcohol burn on the palate that belies its modest 47.8% ABV to the point of confusion. The finish is mediocre at best, without any reprise of the aromatic fruits and with the mouth still smarting from the over-aggressive burn. Luckily it is much improved by the addition of water.']"

Clean and crisp.', ': Honey and malt. Some light oaky bitterness fades out with nondescript florals.', ': Water releases a very nice array of florals and some green grass notes and aloe. Definitely try it with a few drops.', ': Not my new favorite, although I can see the tart notes in the nose being a draw. The palate is even and crisp, with clear flavors of barley and light oak. It seems to me, however, to be a bit of a blank canvas, and the vinegar on the nose is a bit more sour than I’d like. In fact, the leanness of the malt is such that I’d wonder if it was a lowlander – it bears a lot of resemblance to younger Auchentoshan. I do believe that while going through a full bottle, this style will grow on you, but upon first impression I’m not a fan.']"

Malty sweetness rushes to the fore, dredging up memories of childhood bowls of sugary cereal, but without the fake corn-syrup flavor. Freshly-mown hay, buttered toast, and lemon curd. Bakery sweets crusted in crystallized sugar.', ': A reprise of the palate, but with toasty oak and the faintest peat, like wisps of smoke from a fruitwood campfire just starting to catch. Ends with hazelnut butter which fades into just-slightly bitter oak tannins and charcoal.', ': A few drops of water amp up the lemon and banana notes, and introducing a decadent sugary glaze. These persist to the tongue. If you like your malt dessert-like and sweet, definitely experiment with a little water in this.', ': This is an exemplar of the category of unpeated single malts aged exclusively in ex-bourbon. Unlike some other Speyside ex-bourbon malts, which are more like blank canvases that need a little sherry to bring them to their full potential, The BenRiach 12 showcases the twin effects of good ex-bourbon aging: clarity of grain and sweetness of oak. It does this with flawless whiskymaking and precise aging. If you can find it for under $50, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better ex-bourbon malt for the price.

Finishes with mouth-drying orange peel oils.', ': Opens up some interesting meatiness on the nose, like duck in orange sauce or cooked marmalade. Otherwise, it seems to dull the palate. Only really improves the nose.', ': This is a very fine example of a spicy, supple sherried Highlander with the added bonus of Dalmore’s signature orange peel. Better than the 12 year in many ways, it completes the picture that the 12 only hints at. It’s also better than the Gran Reserva, which was underwhelming. Dalmore malts seem to go ‘on sale’ once a year, and drop up to 20% in price for a few weeks. At $56, this is a quality sherried Highland malt for a great price. I’d even say it’s worthwhile around $65. If you want the same flavor profile without the finesse, the Dalmore 12 is also a great deal around $35 right now.']"

There’s a taffy quality to the flavor: sweet but not nuanced. It tastes like it’s predominately bourbon-matured, with both less sherry flavor and less character in general, despite the 60% sherry maturation. Frankly, it’s not as good as the 12, and not nearly as good as the 15.', ': On the short side, and a bit rough? Less orange. Some citrus like sweet candied lemon.', ': Adds a little more lemon. Otherwise no effect that I can determine.', ': I hate to dismiss a supporting character in an otherwise standout cast, but if The Dalmore was going for softness and subtlety here, they went too far. I’d even be worried that it wouldn’t stand up to a robust, full-bodied cigar. If you have money to spend on a Highland malt with orange notes, buy the 15 or the 12.']"

I highly recommend a few drops of water with this one.', ': A light dram, with ghostly wisps of fruit and wood from what is probably refill sherry. The dominant note is limoncello, a first for me, but the overall impression is of lightness. Old lightness, to be sure. The nose is especially elegant, with great integration between the refill sherry and the well-aged grain.

Brandy, a hint of green apple, a swath of malt, and middling caramel sweetness is all I can pick up. Still, the whole is round and complete and pleasant.', ': Thin bodied. Moderate tongue burn, considering the minimum ABV. Generally a reprise of the aroma, with a distinct grape-y brandy note, mildly sweet malt, a haze of barrel char, and a slight hint of green apple / green grape.', ': Medium length. Very consistent, this one. The notes are mostly continuations of the flavors from the palate. The brandy comes to the fore here, with a honey-and-raisin note that fades quickly, leaving barely-bitter tannins. Again, wholesome if uncomplicated.', ': A few drops of water initially shut down the aroma, necessitating a rest in the glass. The aroma comes back slowly – first with increased nose tickle and a vague green bramble note, and then a bit of caramel. On the tongue the body is a little weightier and the tongue burn lessened. The finish is a bit sweeter. Water is optional here – experiment if you’re curious.', ': A very straightforward by-the-numbers dram with a successful if uneventful brandy finish. It tastes exactly like you expect it to – Glenlivet with an extra couple of years of maturation and a glazing of grape-forward brandy. For $40, that’s a slam dunk. I would happily serve this to a guest or bring it to a poker night (I did, in fact).']"
435,The Glenlivet 15 year ,"[': Bright green fruit, some green grape skins, and acidic apple. White sugar, and raw cane juice. Some interesting (but mild) spices, cinnamon and nutmeg from the French oak.', ': Light. Some mild wood. A bit raw on the alcohol (like the 12), and perhaps somewhat watery. Golden raisins.', ': A twist here: maybe dried raspberries? Some nice dry tannins. Medium long, with a surprising touch of lime oil at the tail end.', ': It’s… just OK. It’s better than the 12-year, which lacks a little age and a little wood, both of which are present here. Unfortunately, it suffers from a zealous watering-down. At 46% this would be a beautiful, juicy dram and an exemplar of Glenlivet house style. Instead, it’s just… OK. Normally, I would always recommend a product that represented solid improvement over its cheaper siblings. However, I buy Glenlivet 12 because of the price (as low as $22 around here). With a pricetag verging on $40, the 15-year represents a larger investment and has some stiff competition with other entry-level malts in that price range. I’d far rather splurge the extra 5 or 6 bucks to land some ']"
436,The Glenlivet 18 year ,"[': Hint of plum, but otherwise little sherry influence. Some vanilla, but not much wood. Where’s the green apple?', ': Nice thick body. Creamy, not oily. Golden raisins, fresh green figs, sugar cookies.', ': Not as smooth as I’d have thought for this age. Vanilla again, and some small amount of bitterness. Anise.', ': Brings out coconut on the nose, and some nice fresh banana. I actually like this banana – it smells fresh and clean. The water thins the body somewhat, and ups the acidity, but kills the palate in the process, making it watery. Skip the water.', ': The nice thing about the 12-year is the interesting fresh elements of green apple. The 15 also has some of that, but by the age of 18, it’s mostly gone. In its place isn’t woodiness, or sweetness, or even much complexity. I’m not sure what was happening in the barrel during those 6 extra years, but it wasn’t doing much to elevate this casual standard whisky, alas. That said, it’s hard to beat a decent, drinkable 18 year for under $80. That pricing strategy is the reason I enjoy the 12-year, so why not enjoy the 18 for the same reason? Keep in mind that the ']"
437,The Glenlivet Alpha ,"[': Fruity. A faint whiff of smoke (or was that the smoke in the video? Ah! An exercise in mind control. I get it now). A mild sense of wax. The Glenlivet green apple is present, but hidden partially behind a layer of caramel-and-wood.', ': Soft on the palate. Dark chocolate! Very nice. Mildly smoky, in a roasted coffee sort of way. Caramel and heavy vanilla wood – unusual for Glenlivet. A bit of barrel char.', ': Chocolate returns. Chocolate-covered green apple slices. Yum. Excellently balanced, and very sultry. The nose promised little, but this whisky came through in flavor! I want some more…', ': Games aside, this is some serious whisky. The aromas are fleeting and mild, but on the palate this malt explodes with the clearest chocolate-and-coffee notes I’ve yet to discover in a whisky. It evolves through confectionery and reveals its heavily-wooded nature before fading – very balanced – perfectly without undue bitterness. I’m so happy there’s more to this whisky than just the promotional games!', ' Well, I won’t give myself credit for solving the puzzle because the answer was pretty clear in the Facebook app’s “hints”, but Glenlivet announced on 6/7 that the “secret” to Glenlivet Alpha is the use of whisky aged in “new oak” barrels which previously held single malt. In other words, brand new charred oak barrels were filled at some point with single malt (probably Glenlivet for an earlier release), emptied, and filled with spirit that eventually went into Alpha. This gives the whisky the benefits of new oak (lots of vanilla and soft wood) without the harsh tannins or overly-wooded notes inherent in the use of true new oak barrels. Cool. Also as expected, the whisky is not colored and is not chill-filtered, but no word on the age of the liquid.']"

440,The Glenrothes Select Reserve ,"[': Sharp, acrid, and nutty. The nuts here are odd, like nearly-rancid walnuts. At first, this is off-putting, but it does grow on you. Lemon zest, damp hardwood sawdust, and a light, airy cereal note, like dry breakfast cereal. The whole is pervaded by a hard-to-place acidic note in between crushed grape skins, fino sherry, and grappa. After a rest in the glass, dusty golden raisins emerge.', ': Thin bodied. Dry and austere. Faint malty sweetness, dusty hay, and more grape skins. That weird acidic note returns.', ': Short. Dry and oaky, with a bit more sweetness – apricot jam. No bitterness.', ': A few drops of water intensify the hay notes, nearly making them barnyardy. They also bring out some hazelnut and more citrus peel. There seems to be more sugar on the palate. You can’t go wrong with a little water here, just don’t dilute it too much – stick to drops.', ': Huh. This is an odd duck. Very dry, with very little sweetness from either oak or malt. I’d guess a large amount of this malt was aged in refill ex-bourbon, if not all of it. It’s certainly priced correctly. I wouldn’t recommend this to a newbie – they might be put off by the hay and grappa notes, and the overall dryness – but it does serve as a good value malt to space out the more expensive bottles in your cabinet. Still, it’s not a malt I crave. It’s less straightforward – aka more complex – than Glenlivet 12 or Glenfiddich 12, and has less bitterness (a blessing) than Glenmorangie 10. It’s also not nearly as good as The Balvenie DoubleWood 12-year, and costs about the same.']"

Sweet, but very grain-forward. Hay, banana, blanched almonds (marzipan), and a more subdued citrus flavor; like crystallized orange peel. Slightly bitter, with a touch of charcoal but not much oak presence.', ': Short. Bready again, with a reprise of most of the flavors from the palate. Fades unmemorably. ', ': A few drops of water release a torrent of lemon-lime. Zesty. (See what I did there?) The palate is vaguely sweeter, but also thinner and more watery (even with only a few drops).', ': This tastes younger than the description would have it: that 17 year-out malt is apparently not able to stand up to all of that new millennium whisky. Hallmarks of the house characteristics (nuttiness, brown sugar, citrus and tropical fruits) are present, but one-dimensional and faint. The citrus, as appealing as it is, over-balances the rest of the experience, and the finish is forgettable. At a closeout price of $33, though, it’s not a bad value for your dollar and is far better than ']"
442,The Glenrothes Whisky Maker’s Cut ,"[': Piercing, concentrated balsamic vinegar. Although acetic, there are layers upon layers of jammy and dried fruit notes to balance the tartness. Orange peel, bergamot, dried pear, dried cherry, date, sherry vinegar, and a very faint rancio note in the background. For a lover of sherry bombs like me, this is where it’s at.', ': Thin to medium bodied. Sweet upfront, with a large dose of mixed berry jam and fig cake. After a delayed and muted tongue burn, there are some bitter charcoal/tannic oak flavors that slightly mar the experience. Under that, most of the fruit notes (dry, now) from the aroma remain.', ': On the short side. The bitter notes carry on, along with a little red wine tannin (grape skins), vague nuttiness (raw walnuts?), and then end abruptly with only a ghost of the charcoal left. A slight disappointment.', ': A few drops of water do weird stuff to the aroma, bringing out strong oak and tamping down on the fruit. After a rest in the glass the fruit returns, sweeter. The palate is much better-balanced and shows a lot more of the expected fruit. The finish is still bitter, but less dry. Do this: Pour a dram and smell it until you can’t take it anymore. Then add several drops or a small splash of water, let it sit 5 minutes, and THEN drink it.', ': The aroma on this whisky is to die for, with layers upon layers of sherry goodness. Alas, the palate is slightly marred by overbearing bitterness and the finish is a little thin and short. You can partially remedy the situation by careful use of water. That shouldn’t be a necessary step to enjoy a single malt especially at the whisky maker’s chosen bottling strength, but here we are.']"
443,The Ileach Cask Strength ,"[': Charcoal-flecked, smoke-driven peat. Campfire. Iodine. Meaty. Hint of lemon peel.', ': Thin body. Hot, of course. Faint lemon. Charred meat. Not much else.', ': Medium-long. Thin, slightly acrid smoke. Slight woody sweetness, but tarry. Only slightly bitter.', ': Several drops of water increase the lemon note, and tamp down the smoke. It also reveals a little youthful grassiness. The palate may be slightly sweeter and a bit livelier, as is the finish. Water doesn’t go amiss here, but make sure you experience it at full strength first.', ': The peat is pungent and in full force at this proof, but there’s little to back it up. Young peated whisky is still young whisky, and as strongly as the smoke dominates, it fails to hide the lack of character beneath. It probably still does this better than ']"
444,The Irishman Founder’s Reserve Irish Whiskey ,"[': Peach, marzipan, and honey. Bubblegum. Markedly grainy, with a hint of grassiness and a little glue / industrial solvents, but less so than cheaper blends. The fruit is well-balanced and light, and the sweetness is present but not cloying.', ': Syrupy body. Grain-forward, like too-young malt whiskey, but with more honey and bubblegum. Less fruit than on the aroma, but still lightly sweet. Very low tongue burn, but a little two-dimensional.', ': Raw honey, tropical fruits (kiwi), and a little drying barrel tannin and charcoal bitterness. Fades with dry woodiness and herbal bitters.', ': The addition of a very few drops of water adds banana custard to the aroma and brings out more grassiness on the palate and finish, emphasizing its youth.

Slightly tart, fading into nut butter and marshmallow, and ending with only a slight bitter oaky char. A little thin, but inoffensive.', ': A few drops of water mute the aroma, leaving only a strong vanilla buttercream note. For some reason this continues even after a rest in the glass. I do NOT recommend water with this one!', ': An accomplished, satisfying dram from start to finish. At least as much sherry character as former bottlings of ']"
448,The Macallan Fine Oak (10 year) ,"[': Not the familiar Macallan profile, although there is a nutty, meaty undertone that reminds me of the flagship ', ': Thin bodied, but nutty – hazelnut butter and walnuts. Some slight resiny sherry notes (again, muted and in the background), otherwise an echo of the aroma. Not particularly sweet.', ': Medium-long. Peanut butter, fig jam, fading without bitterness. Pleasant.', ': A small splash of water wakes up an array of fresh fruit notes (fresh and dried berries), but thins the palate even further. Definitely try this with and without water.', ': A pleasant dram, with all of Macallan’s polish and refinement for a very un-Macallan price. As long as you don’t mind missing out on the signature Macallan fruit, this would make a reputable daily sipper in the vein of ']"
449,The Macallan Gold (1824 Series) ,"[': Golden raisins (sultanas) up front and center. Peach syrup and marzipan, wild honey. Vaguely floral. A swirl of the glass releases a wash of fresh pear cider. Quite sunny and pleasant.', ': Thin body. Very soft, with nary a hint of tongue burn. Flavor is mostly cereal – shortbread cookies, buttered scones – and the sherry notes only linger around the edges as dried fruits and tanniny grape skins.', ': Short. Honey, with absolutely no bitter notes. A little heathery on the fade-out. Simple.', ': A few drops of water (not too many, since this is a weak 40% ABV) release a torrent of floral notes – wildflowers, honeysuckle, rose water, orange flower water, etc. The palate is mildly sweeter, and the finish unchanged. A little water is a good idea with this one.', ': Okay so this is very pleasant single malt whisky. It is light and airy, vibrant and youthful (in a good way), and with an array of flowers and fruits that scream “Springtime!” while never becoming cloying, bitter, or overbearing. That said, this is no sherry-bomb. There are no dense red fruits, figs, currants, resin, or anything else commonly associated with the older sherried malts (or even ']"
450,The Macallan Whisky Maker’s Edition ,"[': Resinous and sharp, with piercing notes of blood orange, fig, and raisin. Typical sherry-driven profile, with a lot of dried fruit and a funky twist, like the aroma of sour ale. Deep, complex, and satisfying, although the deeper leathery notes of old sherry are missing, replaced with tart fruits.', ': Syrupy. Raisins in bread pudding, with a haze of caramel. Echoes perfectly the collection of notes from the aroma, fully delivering on the promise of the nose. Strength seems “just right”, with just a splash of fire up front. Very drinkable at this ABV.', ': Of medium length. Raisins again, with some sparkling tart notes (kiwi, golden raisin, redcurrants), and red wine reduction. Simple, but pleasant.', ': If you add water to this, let it rest in-glass for several minutes, as it initially dampens most of the aroma. After a rest there is decidedly more caramel, with added buttercream frosting (vanilla) in exchange for far less fruit and a thinner body. I’d skip the water, especially since this 42.8% bottling strength was an intentional choice by Macallan.', ': A satisfying, full-flavored sherried malt in true Macallan style. There is clearly a hefty dose of younger (12 year ish) sherried malt, given the lack of leather and rancio notes and the prevalence of fruit flavors that come across as fresh instead of dried. Still, it’s perfectly well-balanced, finishes elegantly, and tastes just like it smells (a rarity). As a Travel Retail offering this wouldn’t make for a regular purchase, but as a gift or a memento it fits the bill nicely and the price tag is commensurate with current price standards in single-malt scotch (especially with The Macallan name). It’s certainly better than ']"
451,The Quiet Man Irish Whiskey ,"[': Definitely a blend. Grain up front, with an interesting zesty lemon-lime high note (lime is not a note I commonly find in any whiskey). Moderate caramel aromas form a base for a round, if not deep, profile.', ': Thin body. Some young grain notes (glue, vodka) offset by a mild oak influence (caramel, pecan) and a very tame tongue burn. Certainly easy to drink (aka ', ': Of medium length. Sweeter than expected, with vanilla buttercream frosting and hazelnut butter. Lingering, with a tinge of coconut and lime peel on the tail end.', ': A few drops of water amp up the nose tickle, requiring a rest to calm down. After the rest, I don’t detect any changes. Water optional, but at 40% I wouldn’t bother.', ': I was prepared to write this off as another sourced blend trying to build a brand name out of somebody else’s whiskey (to be fair, until the distillery output reaches bottling age, that’s exactly what it is). Still, there’s an interesting high note in the aroma, a mild baseline of caramel thanks to the finishing in first-fill bourbon, and a rather tasty sweet finish. Not too shabby for a blend, and it can go toe-to-toe with ']"
452,The Singleton of Dufftown (12 year) ,"[': Bubble gum. Dense fruit punch aromas, ', ': Thin body. Sweet again, with the same gum and punch notes. Orange taffy, vanilla, and cream soda. Negligible tongue burn. Sweet and fruity, but lacks complexity.', ': Short. The fruits have become faint, but the candy flavors (corn syrup) remain. Fades very quickly without additional notes.', ': The addition of a few drops of water initially shocks the aroma, washing out all of the fruit. It comes back slowly, and without a noticeable change. The flavor and finish are the same, with the addition of a green apple note. Water optional, but not needed.', ': The very definition of one-dimensional. This absolutely smells and tastes like alcoholic fruit punch. On the upside, there are no off-notes, no bitterness, and no “paint thinner” notes that often accompany inexpensive malts. On the downside, there is a total lack of complexity that, aside from the initial fruity surprise, leaves the drinker wishing for something more. You can definitely do better at this price-point, with the aforementioned ']"
453,The Singleton of Glendullan (15 year) ,"[': Lightly malty, and strikingly fruit-forward. Kiwi, green apple, faint coconut, and green banana. Not very much depth, but also not cloying. Delicate and pleasant. A rest in the glass ripens the banana, which begins to dominate.', ': Medium-bodied, almost syrupy. Initially sweet, with cookie dough and caramel. Medium tongue burn (more than expected for 40% ABV), resolving into slightly bitter charcoal, nut butter, and marshmallow.', ': Short. Fades with more marshmallow, oaky bitterness, and some muddy charcoal. Kind of a mess.', ': A few drops of water coax a deeply sweet buttercream vanilla frosting note from the aroma. Now it smells like banana cream pie. The palate seems less distinct, and there is more of a bitter walnut note. Try both without, and then with water.', ': Reminds me of ']"
454,The Yamazaki (12 year) Japanese Whisky ,"[': Fruit galore – there is a punchbowl of green banana, mango, honeydew, and pear – and a thick layer of pink bubblegum. Subsequent nosings give more and more banana, which is starting to verge on overripe. Under all the fruit is a veiled quantity of malt and cereal sugars. Luckily, after a few minutes of rest, the nose becomes dominated by the bubble-gum note, and not the banana.', ': Nicely viscous body, and a very mild tongue burn. A touch bitter to start, then some banana and toffee and a slight suggestion of old oak.', ': A wave of anise, followed by barbeque char, burned nuts, and bitter lemon. Medium-long.', ': A splash of water opens up some black licorice, but doesn’t ameliorate the intensity of the banana notes. It also thins the body. I’d skip the water here.', ': The positive experience of smelling all that fruit was short-lived. I’m not a big fan (as my regular readers know) of banana notes in whisky, and they are plentiful here, at least in the aroma. Pair that with a lot of bitterness on the finish, and you have a whisky that I wouldn’t buy for myself. It actually reminds me of the entry-level ']"

456,Tobermory (10 year) ,"[': Yeasty and robust, with some dark, mushroomy peat and smoldering coals over a layer of butterscotchy malt. The peat has an oily, industrial quality not unlike Springbank. A rest in the glass reveals some elements of bourbon cask aging – caramel and vanilla.', ': Medium bodied. Even tongue burn, with a nice balance of alcohol to malty sweetness at 46.3% ABV. Here the malt sugars emerge in the form of burnt caramel and assorted cereal notes, although the peat becomes a bit muddy.', ': Long and peaty, but in an earthy way. More caramel, vanilla and barrel char. Not particularly bitter, although the fade-out leaves some ashy, asphalt notes.', ': Water tames the peat somewhat, revealing more vanilla and malt. A few drops can’t hurt, but don’t dilute it too much.', ': This is akin to 10 year-old Springbank in many ways – from the earthy “not quite smokey” peat, to the industrial oily notes, and the emphasis on barrel char. I think I prefer Springbank for its clearer malt character and eclectic complexity. Still, this “poor man’s Springbank” isn’t bad for the price, and I think the choice of bottling at 46.3% ABV is spot-on. The earthy, mushroomy quality of peated whisky is clear despite only coming from the water, although it is less prominent than in a fully peated whisky, such as those from Islay. At around $55, there isn’t a lot of reason to recommend this 10 year-old. It has been said that Tobermory and Ledaig are better suited to long aging, and that the 20+ year-old bottlings are refined and complex. It thus may be worthwhile skipping Tobermory unless you particularly like the oily/mildly peated style and are looking for alternatives to Springbank.']"

Honey up front (candy corn), with flecks of saltwater taffy, malty rye notes (marshmallow and malted milk balls, minus the chocolate), and pine sap. Nicely balanced, and on the dry side, so it’s not cloying. Medium amount of wood influence, although it tastes like pine, not oak (yes, I know it’s not a pine barrel).', ': Long, slightly warming. Lemony (like scented furniture polish), brown sugar. Fades with drying oaky tannins and no bitterness.', ': Several drops of water initially mute the nose, then open up a bit of vanilla frosting.

458,Tom’s Foolery Bonded Bourbon ,"[': Heavy scents of pine and eucalyptus – exactly like barely-aged rye. The effect should be woodsy but is instead antiseptic and piercing. There is little else to discover under that aromatic blanket of pith and menthol, although a rest in the glass and some coaxing reveals some nougat.', ': Syrupy body. Medium tongue-burn (not bad for 100 proof). A tasty array of milk chocolate-covered nougat, light caramel and almond extract, but marred by an echo of that pine sap (or raw cardamom?) note.', ': Long and warming. A good balance between the young-rye pine from the aroma and the sweets from the palate, both of which linger. Fades without bitterness with more nutty nougat and a sudden dried fruit sweetness that is almost like fig (or apple skins?). At the tail end of this quite long (for a bourbon) finish, one finds the eucalyptus/menthol again.', ': Water, alas, intensifies the pine sap notes and renders the entire glass indistinguishable from a snifter of Pine Sol. (That’s conjecture, for the more literal-minded of my readers, as I’ve never personally sampled a snifter of household cleaner. I’m looking at you, guy who thinks I eat rotten fruit because I think a certain whisky tastes like rotten banana). Skip the water here, or water it down and let it sit for awhile to disperse the volatile esters.', ': A quandary. This smells like a $25 bottle of 2 year-old craft rye, but tastes like a malted confection, almost scotch-like in its balance of flavors but unquestionably bourbon. It also has a very successful finish, woodsy and sweet but without any unwelcome oaky bitterness. I hate to disagree with the Davids, but I can’t recommend this one. Still, Tom’s Foolery is a craft distillery to watch, especially if they can age out some of that piney rye. I just wouldn’t drop $50 on this unless you’re Ohioan and want to show some Buckeye pride.', ': Tom from Tom’s Foolery asked me to take another look at the Foolery and compare it to Wyoming Whisky.

Standard, in a partially-sherried kind of way.', ': Nice density to the body, almost silky. Nut skins, shredded wheat, and dried cherries on a bed of hum-drum malt.', ': Short. Some dried fruit, nougat again, and a hint of bitterness, like over-caramelized sugar.', ': A few drops of water draw out the tart fruits – cranberries, sour apple, both on the nose and palate. Also some cocktail bitters and marshmallow on the finish. Water isn’t a bad idea here.', ': Underwhelming. There are some nice “sherried malt” effects, but nothing stands out as worthy of attention. Forgettable. Of course, it’s wisely marketed at the bargain basement price of $23 to $26, which is perfectly in line with its quality. If you’re desperate to find under-$30 malts in a market inundated with price increases, you should give this one a look. Then again, it probably performs best in a blend.']"

Mild vanilla extract, which fades quickly.', ': A few drops of water adds an unfortunate alcohol burn to the aroma, and brings out a grassy, vegetal note that wasn’t there before.

Take it or leave it.', ': This may indeed be “The Gentle Dram”, but even at 10 years of age it leaves a lot to be desired. The usual suspects for a Highland malt aged in middling ex-bourbon casks are present – the typical caramel, yeasty bread, brown sugar, and nuts – but nothing serves to elevate this dram above any other similarly-aged malt. At least at 10 years of age, it’s unfortunately forgettable.

Raw honey, again, complete with the comb. Toasted oats, slight wood, and not bitter.', ': Short. Minty, with licorice and menthol. Evolves into a reprise of the white peach and honey from the aroma, and then fades quickly.', ': A few drops of water brings more of that white peach to the front, along with green tea. Alas, it seems to drown out the other notes. The water also makes the palate thinner and even more watery, perhaps even bland. If you use water, use it sparingly.', ': A tasty, easygoing malt that has been murdered by the addition of far too much water. By God, this should be 46% at least.

Light fruits – white peach – and a dose of barrel tannin that’s on the bitter side. On second taste there’s something buttery mid-palate, like Scottish shortbread cookies.', ': Medium-short. A bit grainy, with some grassy new-make and a continuation of that bitterness from the palate, but it is in balance.', ': A few drops of water improves the palate, with added notes of caramel and a dilution of that bitterness. Definitely add a splash of water, despite the already low ABV.', ': A few more years and a bottle strength of 46% ABV would do wonders for this malt. The nose is straightforward but delectable. The palate is somewhat washed-out, and the finish suffers somewhat from its youth (or lack of heavy wood influence). This isn’t a malt to impress at this age, but it shows promise of complexity in its future. I’d love to try an independent bottling of Tormore with a bit more age (16?), higher proof (46%), and without chill-filtration. The 12-year, if you can find it, is only $35 or so, which is certainly a respectable price for a light, refreshing dram.']"

Not much depth, certainly, and the 40% ABV bottling strength spreads what complexity there is woefully thin, but one could easily sip through several glasses of this without much trouble. Definitely worth $30, and with that nice waxy note, I’d even say it was worth $40. This was a well-chosen barrel, although I’d have gladly paid $40 for a 46% ABV version.']"

Lemon pervades, fading into walnut skins, charcoal, spent ashes, and a bit more bitterness.', ': A drop of water perfumes the nose, bringing some more delicate notes. It also smooths out some of the rough edges on the palate. The added water is an improvement.', ': For the price, this is eminently drinkable straight. Certainly it’s not going to win any awards, but with a pleasant lemon nose, nutty/cereal on the palate, and no “cheap blended” aspect in the finish, this is an easy value. It’s not as elegant and well-balanced as single-malt scotch, nor is it as flavorful and textural as single pot still Irish whiskey, but it straddles the line and provides an inexpensive alternative to a palate weary of both.

467,Trader Joe’s Speyside Single Malt 13 year (2002 – 2015) ,"[': Faint orange peel. Nutty nougat. Otherwise a pretty standard malty ex-bourbon aroma (cereal grains, faint vanilla, etc.).', ': Thin body. Marzipan. A little bitter (wood char), but mostly bland.', ': Short. Oaky and nutty. Not much sweetness or individuality. Fades with a bitter note (like rancid walnuts).', ': A few drops of water add nothing interesting to the aroma, nor the palate. They might make the finish a little more crisp. Maybe.', ': Bland, and somewhat bitter. Not a successful malt. This should probably not have been saved from the mountain of “blending fodder” barrels for which it was no doubt originally destined. There are no redeeming florals, fruits, or even cloying sweets. Instead, it mostly just tastes like insipid wood and alcohol. If you’re standing in a Trader Joe’s on a smartphone right now, trying to make a decision, I’ll make it for you: Get the 12 year-old Highland (psst! It’s from Deanston) instead.']"
468,Trader Joe’s Speyside Single Malt 18 Year (1993) ,"[': Yeasty bread, green apple juice and skins, vanilla. Pale, unripe fruit and mild cereal grains. Very slight florals. Simple and mellow.', ': Medium-bodied. Yeast again – somewhat cardboardy (new word!). The fruit is missing here – only thin grains and water. What I wouldn’t give for another 6% ABV.', ': Slight tannins, and some bitterness. Charcoal, green grass.', ': A few drops brings freshly-cut crass and assorted aromatic botanicals to the nose at the expense of the green apple notes. It reveals some needed sweetness on the palate – unripe pear? – and tames (somewhat) the bitter finish. Paradoxically, this already well watered-down dram benefits from a little more water. Who knew.', ': At a blind tasting, I would call this as a 14 year-old Glenlivet from a refill bourbon barrel. The green apple skin on the nose is usually a dead giveaway (for me) of a Glenlivet. Alas, this pales in comparison to the official Distillery Bottling 18-year. This was probably a cask destined for blending that got waylaid by an optimistic independent bottler. It’s not hard to see why this barrel was marked down to such an extreme extent, although $26 retail a bottle for an 18 year-old scotch (after the costs and hassle of US bottling and distribution) may actually be a loss for the original producer. The promising nose is betrayed by a near-total lack of flavor on the palate, and a lackluster finish. Bottling this at cask strength perhaps would have saved its dignity, but at 40% it has fallen mostly apart. ']"
469,Treaty Oak “Ghost Hill” Texas Bourbon ,"[': Taffy and buttercream up front, sweet wheat dinner rolls, honey, anise, and a persistent green-grassiness. Sweet, and unmistakably wheated. A rest in the glass makes it even sweeter, and picks up some sticky caramel notes.', ': Silky, full body. Sweet up front as well, although it’s a tad hot even for 47.5% ABV. After the burn, some nice deep oaky sugar notes, maple candies, raw honeycomb, and resiny fresh-hewn oak emerge. ', ': Medium-long. Oak tannins abound, and the finish is far drier than I expected. A hint of charcoal and toasted white bread. Fades without evolving.', ': Several drops of water bring out grainy, grassy, and paint-thinner notes. If you add water, you’ll want to let these dissipate. After a rest, a new vanilla note seems to have washed out the rest. It does make the finish sweeter. Water does some weird stuff here – I’d avoid it.', ': A different animal than the brand’s sourced ']"
470,Treaty Oak “Red Handed” Bourbon ,"[': Papery, with an initial waft of smoke and black pepper. A wide (or “round”) aroma profile of dry corn husks, wood chips, black licorice and a slight ashy fungal note. Not sweet. It takes a rest in the glass to reveal some lively notes of peach and nougat. Definitely give this some time to open up.', ': Medium bodied with a medium tongue burn (not bad for nearly 50% ABV). Palate notes seem shyer than the aroma, but include cherry wood, maraschino cherries, and (finally!) a raft of rye spices… principally cinnamon. There is also a continuation of the black pepper and licorice from the nose.', ': Of medium length. Ashy again with a mouth-drying oaky tannin and faint honey and corn-syrup. Fades with a ghost of candied cherries and menthol, and totally without bitterness.', ': Several drops of water bring out some grassiness along with a strong suggestion of rye grain that continue from the aroma through to the tongue, where it thins the body. Water doesn’t hurt anything here, but really doesn’t add much either.', ': This is indeed something different. Drier than most bourbons, and with an interesting set of wood notes that lean towards the smoky. A rest in the glass adds some much needed balance in the form of fruit and light sweetness. The whole is very dry, though, which I appreciate. ']"

Cotton candy and fruit punch, fresh green apple, lemonade, and a waxy note that could be beeswax or could be Pledge floor polish.', ': Thin body. Very hot, even for 50% ABV. After the burn subsides, there is a reprise of some of the sweet/fruity notes from the aroma, plus bubblegum.', ': Medium-short. More of the same (it’s consistent, I’ll give it that). Finishes downright tart, like sour candy.', ': A few drops of water – for some reason – seems to mute the aroma, adding only a faint rosewater note. I suggest saving the water unless you find it too hot for your liking.', ': 10 year-old rye is in short supply in the market these days (hence the inflated price), but I’m not sure how sold I am on this one.

473,Tullibardine (Alexander Murray: Polly’s Casks) ,"[': Classic Highland malt, with hints of hay and unripe stonefruit (think crunchy peaches). At 40% ABV the nose tickle is so slight that it almost SMELLS watered-down. A ghost of lemon peel is the only other note I can tease out. One-dimensional, verging on bland.', ': Thin body. Sweet, with a clear honey note. Almost nonexistent tongue burn, but isn’t as watery as I feared. Malty cereal notes and a little oaky vanilla, and that’s about it. No off notes.', ': Short. A bit of minerality sneaks in, but mars the sweetness with a metallic twang. Fades quickly, leaving only a little oak tannin behind, and something bitter that could be hops from the ale casks, but it could also be my imagination.', ': A couple of drops of water bring a new pear note, which was sorely needed. It is, however, fleeting. The palate sparkles a little more. Add a few drops of water if you find this bland, but not too much lest you dilute it.', ': I had higher hopes for the ale casks, which are nowhere to be found. Instead, we have the most basic possible Highland malt, with no frills, and more than a few hints of excessive youth. Whereas the better ex-bourbon Highland malts are adorned with fruits, flowers, and other subtle touches… this has none of those things. A disappointment.']"
474,Tullibardine 500 Sherry Finish ,"[': A piercing vinegar note – like an expired wine – with a significant sulphur note. Dry, acidic, and with the fruit notes (green apple, pear, lemon) marred by the vinegar. There is a very thin layer of almost-sweet malt, which is hidden below the weird wine notes.', ': Syrupy body. Much sweeter on the tongue, with a nice pear drop flavor, lemon peel, and white cherries. The malt is still far in the background. There is also a suggestion of blanched almonds.', ': Medium-long. Still acidic, but the sweetness is in better balance now. Raw wildflower honey, pale malt, and not even a hint of bitterness. Fades slowly without evolving further.', ': A few drops of water don’t seem to help matters, but combined with a rest in the glass the situation improves: There is a lot more sweetness (vanilla) and a lot less sour wine. If you have a bad initial experience like I did, definitely try adding some water and five minutes of rest time.', ': Huh. This would be a passably interesting single malt if it weren’t for the severely off-putting vinegar / sour wine notes on the aroma. I’m not usually one to notice sulphur notes in whisky, but even I couldn’t escape it here. Things improve once you get the liquid past your nose, but the experience is unalterably dampened by that point. This could be a personal taste thing, and someone else who likes strong tart notes in whiskies might adore this dram, so if you run across an inexpensive way to try it out, see if you have a different experience than I did. It’s also – as always – possible that I encountered a sub-standard batch.']"

476,Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye (13 year) ,"[': Concentrated wood extract, fresh orange peel soaked in orange and cherry bitters. Ancient cracking shellac on cherrywood furniture. Any minty character or fresh spices contributed by the rye have been long dissolved by communication with white oak, but they are replaced by deep, complex wood extractives. Orange oil, spice cake, and something unnameable that makes you roll your eyes back in ecstasy. Honestly, if I could bottle and wear this scent, I would be happy to spend the rest of my days smelling like Van Winkle rye.', ': Orange oil again, with dark brown sugar and a drying astringency similar to old red wine. Maple sugar candies, melted vanilla bean ice cream, and worn leather. The tongue burn is muted, considering its proof, inviting one to savor a mouthful for minutes at a time.', ': Medium-long. A hint of Douglas fir, and a continuance of the orange/cherry/maple flavors from the nose. No bitterness, but a lingering tannin causes the mouth to dry and pucker as the last sweetness fades.', ': To me, this tastes like the Van Winkle bourbon, but with the heavier (and sweeter) syrupy notes replaced with orange peel, cherry bitters, and a more apparent conversation with oak. Thankfully, whether at 13 or 18 years of aging, it stops short of being over-oaked. It is said that this particular rye has been resting, unchanging, in stainless steel tanks for decades in order to prevent it from aging further while limited amounts were siphoned off for yearly bottling. This is indeed at its apex of age, and it will be a sad day when those tanks run dry and the last bottle of Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye sees the light of its final day.']"

A heavy tongue burn is followed by red apple skins, tannic oak, tart but dry oaky sugars, toasty corn, and cherry syrup (no longer tart). Dry, but with good balance.', ': Medium length. Warming, slightly sweet but muddled, with unclear flavors from the palate. A little bitterness (bitter herbs) develops, and the finish becomes more dry before fading.', ': Several drops of water amp up the nose tickle briefly, before adding a tinge of sweetness in the form of plain simple syrup. The palate and finish seem unchanged, aside from extra bitterness. Water optional.', ': A decent all-around bourbon. On the dry side, but with good balance. The additional ABV over its siblings has brought additional robustness and concentrated flavor, as well-needed extra sweetness. I’m still missing some of the volatile fruit notes from ']"
478,Very Old Barton 86 Proof ,"[': Delicately fruity, with fruit punch, orange juice, cherry syrup, and bubble gum. Sharp nose tickle despite the low ABV, but no young or ‘off’ aromas.', ': Medium bodied. Very mild tongue burn. Tannic and slightly bitter (already) up front. Fruit punch and bubblegum again, but also bitter aromatic compounds (Angostura bitters) and anise.', ': Medium-long. Less tannic than expected – only slightly mouth-drying. Drier now, and quite bitter as those aromatic bitters flavors continue through the finish. No evolution.', ': A few drops of water amp up the bubblegum note and increase the nose tickle. The body seems thinner. This doesn’t benefit from the addition of water.', ': A very stable, capable, workhorse bourbon. There isn’t any of the dense robust oakiness that one usually associates with bourbon, but it’s also not too dry or too cloyingly sweet. There’s more bitterness than I like in a bourbon, but the fruit notes and the lack of off-flavors make this far better than a $12 whiskey has any right to be. Don’t get me wrong, this is still bottom-shelf bourbon that couldn’t compete with the likes of ']"
479,Very Old Barton 90 Proof ,"[': Slightly stronger nose tickle (than ', ': Soft and supple, medium bodied. A moderate tongue burn is followed by more bananas and caramel. There’s more sweetness on the palate, and less bitterness.', ': Of medium length. Now the bitterness shows, with anise and various bitter herbs. Not terribly tannic or mouth-drying. Fades without evolving.', ': A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma. Even a rest in the glass doesn’t resolve this, instead adding more nose tickle. The palate seems thinner, with no added flavors. Only the palate picks up a vague tart cherry note, which does balance the bitterness a little. Don’t bother with the water here.', ': Super weird. At least with my bottles, going from the 86 proof to the 90 proof means more nose tickle and tongue burn as expected, but the loss of most of the fruit flavors and the gain of very little nondescript sweetness. My least favorite of the three reviewed today, by a large margin. Guess that 2% did make a big difference after all, just not in the direction I expected. If you’re in the store, go for the ']"
480,W. L. Weller (12 year) Bourbon ,"[': Lovely round profile, classic wheated bourbon notes of soft caramel and sugar-dusted breakfast cereals. This one has a sour twang, like sour cherries, and a distinctly corn-oriented acetone note. A little wood is detectable as a vein of ground cinnamon.', ': Very soft on the palate. Silky, even. Moderate tongue burn. A little anise on the front, some nice fresh corn notes in the middle, and a continuous acetic acid throughout, like cider vinegar or vermouth.', ': Medium length, with vanilla and some light drying barrel tannins. Caramel reappears, with honey-flavored candy (candy corn). No bitterness. Pleasant.', ': Several drops of water add maybe a hint of maple syrup to the nose. Alas, the water seems to introduce a bitter note in the finish. I personally will skip the water.', ': There is a nice array of pleasant flavors and aromas, although just because this is a wheated recipe does not mean it bears much resemblance to Pappy Van Winkle 15. There just isn’t that much depth in the W.L. Weller. Still, for the money this is an easy-going sipper – an uncomplicated glass of bourbon, both with and without an ice cube.']"
481,W. L. Weller Special Reserve Bourbon ,"[': Soft, cereal-forward bourbon. A ghost of cherry, a twist of black pepper, and a blanket of sweet corn kernels. A rest in the glass brings more cherry notes to the fore.', ': Full body, not quite syrupy. Soft, silky on the tongue. A mild tongue burn is followed by cherry cough syrup, mild oaky sweetness, and some mouth-drying tannins.', ': Medium long. Very consistent with the palate. A slight bitterness, and fades with a ghost of fresh cherry.', ': A few drops of water seem to have no effect on the nose. Ditto the palate. No need for water, but an ice cube isn’t going to kill it.', ': A solid wheated bourbon. This actually tastes the way I imagined that ']"
482,Wasmund’s Single Malt ,"[': Scorched wood and charcoal up front, followed immediately by pungent banana. (Oh God, not the banana…) Yup, now all I smell is banana. I have since learned that this aroma is “isoamyl acetate”, which doesn’t make it any better. After a rest in the glass, the banana has transformed into banana-flavored cardboard with a side of bland woodsmoke (like the effect of a far-distant forest fire) and a medicinal iodine note. Blech.', ': Thin bodied. An intense tongue burn kicks in right away, followed by pear drops and other hard candies, applewood smoke (yay!), and marshmallow.', ': Short. Pleasant, with fruitwood smoke, mild banana, and light menthol. Fades quickly with candy notes (banana Runts, I think).', ': A healthy splash of water does little for the aroma. On the palate, it brings up a little more fruit and tames the tongue burn. Water isn’t really needed here.', ': I can’t recommend anything after writing the word “Blech” in the tasting notes. That said, the whisky is what it says on the tin. There is definite fruitwood (apple, primarily) smoke, and it’s malty. That said, the travesty of isoamyl acetate and cardboard on the aroma can’t be saved by fruit and smoke on the tongue. This bottle has a wide price range, with outliers in the bottom of the range around $30. I think $30 is a fair price for this which means I might feel cheated paying $45. That said, someone who is less sensitive to that awful banana note might really enjoy this.']"

Malty, with a hint of milk chocolate and a reprise of the acetone/vodka from the nose, alas.', ': A few drops of water make this smell, if possible, more like whisky-tinged vodka. The water also thins the palate, adding nothing. Skip the water here.', ': Huh. On one hand, it’s light traditionally-styled Irish blended whiskey with a heavy basket full of nutty flavors to surprise the tongue. On the other hand, it has one of the least successful aromas of any whisky I’ve come across, a short finish, and is very hot on the tongue (some would call this “not smooth”). I can’t recommend it for anything, although when mixed into one of the few cocktails requiring Irish whiskey, you’ll likely not be able to tell the difference. How’s that for a ringing endorsement?']"
487,Westland American Oak ,"[': Oak-forward, with slightly tannic sap notes that are almost like pine resin. Dry – with very reticent sugars. A pleasant yeasty top note suggests sour ale or cider vinegar. After a rest in the glass it opens up with a little cherry and a dollop of pancake syrup.', ': Silky body. Again oak-forward, with lots of mouth-drying oaky tannins. After a minimal tongue burn, there is a dominant cereal note that very strongly suggests chocolate stout. The toasty barley is very slightly bitter (like bittersweet chocolate) and not quite acrid or burned (a blessing). ', ': Medium-long. That chocolate note – now joined by roasted coffee bean – continues robustly into and throughout the finish. A little nuttiness – nougat or pecan – appears and fades slowly. Ends without any trailing bitterness.', ': The addition of several drops of water amps up the nose tickle without adding any new notes. The palate seems softer, but the chocolate notes are diluted. The finish is a bit more vibrant. I suggest trying it without the water and then add a little to see if it does anything for you.', ': The aroma begins a little shy and unpromising, but on the palate this whisky shines with chocolate and malt and oak in a potent balance. The experience if very like sipping a dark roast iced coffee with unsweetened cocoa powder in it. The finish is rock-solid and complete with all of the palate notes, and ends gracefully without any extra bitterness – a success.']"
488,Westland Peated ,"[': Smoldering campfire, with just a little suggestion of pine (resiny) smoke. The smoke, though, is so mild that it acts more like a seasoning. The primary character is sweet malty grains, butterscotch, ripe pear, and salted caramel. The smoke is so well-integrated that it simply adds a peppery, toasty quality to all of the above notes… think grilled pear instead of ripe pear, or caramel with smoked salt. Delectable.', ': Medium bodied. Ashy peat greets the tongue, then after a mild tongue burn the peat begins to recede to reveal dark chocolate truffles, pear pastilles, and dark roast coffee beans.', ': Long. The chocolate is dominant, now, instead of the smoke. Cocoa powder, coffee grounds, and only a little bit of oaky tannins. As it fades, the peat turns minty – a touch of menthol.', ': A few drops of water increase the nose tickle, and also add more sweetness (caramel). The water also tames the tongue burn, and might decrease the effects of the peat. Water optional, but I don’t think it hurts here.', ': Of the three flagship ']"
489,Westland Sherry Wood ,"[': Straightforward sherry notes – fig, plum/prune, date, and balsamic vinegar (including a slight tart note) – but on the dry side. Underneath, mild oak with a bit of nuttiness. A rest in the glass adds some dried cranberries and the whole thing becomes a tad sweeter (added caramel).', ': Heavy body, almost viscous. Chocolate-covered cherries (dark ones) up front, with a moderate tongue burn. Roasted coffee beans, cocoa nibs, and a reprise of the dark dried fruit notes from the aroma. Underneath, the mild oak continues to support.', ': Medium-short. Drying – with a lot of dusty cocoa and fruit leather. The fruit and chocolate notes fade quicker than I expected, leaving just oak sawdust and mouth-drying (but not bitter!) tannins.', ': A few drops of water amp up that tart note (increasing the impression of balsamic vinegar) but cover up some of the dried fruit. The palate also seems more tart, with less chocolate. I suggest skipping the water – 46% ABV is just right.', ': Westland’s malt is so good that the coating of sherry almost seems like unnecessary window dressing. The classic Westland coffee-and-chocolate notes are present in abundance, and although the sherry notes pair well with them (chocolate-covered cherries yes please), they feel like a layer on top rather than integrated into the whole.

A moderate tongue burn is followed by wave after wave of those same notes from the aroma. Very consistent. Baked bananas with heavy caramelized syrups. Roasted nuts. A latte.', ': Medium length.

Some oaky vanilla in there too, but not much in the way of traditional rye “spices”. Maybe some cinnamon.', ': Medium body. Dry woodiness greets the tongue, followed by a robust tongue burn, appropriate for 101 proof. Barrel tannins, cherry juice, and sweet corny bourbon notes march in line. More astringent than expected from the aroma, and still only limited spices (clove this time).', ': On the short side. A touch of bubble gum, a ghost of pine resin, and not much else. Forgettable.', ': A few drops of water brighten the palate, adding some marshmallow and orange peel. It also seems to improve the finish by allowing some of those fruits to linger, adding balance. Water is a good idea here.', ': This tastes like a reasonable budget rye. I think it’s a bit dumbed-down, trading in rye spice for corn sweetness, and it has a disappointing finish without timely addition of water. Unfortunately, it is allocated in some markets and surprisingly pricey when you can find it. The 81-proof is available for $25 a bottle, which is also high for what it is.

A rest in the glass adds sweetness, and reveals some of the rye spices (clove, cinnamon, etc.).', ': Syrupy body. The same notes from the aroma show on the entry, but a wave of tongue burn washes everything away. Hot for 45%. After the burn subsides, the aroma notes return, plus cinnamon red hots and sugar cookie dough.', ': Medium-long. Somewhat dry, but very consistent with the flavors on the tongue. Fades with a bit of hazelnut butter and some slightly-bitter charcoal.', ': A small splash of water appears to have little effect, except for taming the tongue burn a bit while also thinning the body.', ': While somewhat dry (like most Wild Turkey), this is a nice balance of the advertised components: rye-like spices with bourbon-like sweetness, and a little sweet tea and peach thrown in for pizzazz. I’m not sure it’s really worth almost $50 considering the other very value-conscious Wild Turkey offerings, especially with no age statement and a midline proof.

494,Wild Turkey Longbranch ,"[': Deeply oaky and with more smoke than commonly found in bourbon. It has aromas of charred corn, drippy oak resin, ', ': Medium body. Dry, despite the sweet aroma notes. Tons of oak, heavy root notes (root beer, sassafras, etc.), and balanced charcoal. I might taste mesquite, or it could be marketing. Either way, this is a tasty slightly-sweet bourbon with just barely enough tongue burn to feel legitimate.', ': Long. Most of the palate notes continue through the finish, including the mesquite/marketing. Fades slowly without getting bitter. Very nice.', ': Several drops of water initially amps up the nose tickle, so give it a rest in the glass. Even after the rest, it remains overly astringent. This bourbon does not benefit from added water.', ': This is a very capable bourbon. It ticks all of the boxes while also having a little “extra” in the form of mesquite charcoal and derived mild smoke flavors. I would have preferred an age statement and a bump in ABV to 48% or 50%, but even at the suggested retail of $40 this is right on the money – literally! Hah! So I can’t really complain. It can easily be found for cheaper, even under $30, which is quite a good deal.']"
495,Willett Family Reserve Estate Bottled Rye (2 year) ,"[': Pine! Showers of sappy pine needles. The nose tickle is prominent, but not excessive. Deeper in, I can get a full, round sweetness, a smattering of star anise and cardamom, and a palpable sense that this is carefully made, genuine rye whiskey.', ': Thin body. At full cask strength, the burn is (as expected) eye-watering. Then, there are waves of minty wintergreen Tic-Tacs, sweet cereal grains, and malted milk balls (minus the chocolate).', ': Medium-long. A baseline of caramel malt syrup underlies more pine and wintergreen. As the sweetness fades, a little caraway and the remnants of anise linger, with a slight astringent tannin. No bitterness to speak of.', ': A much-needed splash of water reveals a dusty spice-bin, redolent with clove and nutmeg. On the palate, the burn is much reduced – a relief – and one is able to focus on the sweet grains and sharp spices of true rye whiskey. The finish is also somewhat spicier – with powdered cinnamon finally making an appearance.', ': A case-study in rye whiskey. Rye is (in my opinion) best serviced by brief aging (two year is perfect) and at cask strength. This is the holy convergence of eclectic, robust, sippable whiskey and perfection for period cocktail mixing. When you use a “real” rye whiskey like this, the rye elements shine through the cocktail, marrying perfectly with bitters, and the high proof gives the drink body and substance. This type of rye makes for a snappy, poignant cocktail instead of a muddy sweet one. I’m very happy that Willett is finally able to distill their own juice, and doubly happy that the juice is SO GOOD.']"

Sweet up-front, like liquid tart candy. Apple skins, fresh corn, bottled light corn syrup. Very little tongue burn, but there is a background acrid plastic note and a grainy corn-whiskey note.', ': Short. Simple, fruity. Fades with a bit of barrel-char bitterness, which is the first note of oak I’ve tasted yet. That acrid plastic note returns, now tinged with menthol… like mouthwash. Ends with a flourish of honey.', ': A few drops of water dull some of the fruit and release a wave of vanilla extract. The finish is a little more tart. Water optional.', ': At first it reminded me of McAfee’s Benchmark in that it smells highly floral and fruity for a bourbon, and comes across the palate thin and insubstantial, like an unaged corn whiskey. The whole is oddly candied, and has fruit notes like you’d imagine finding in beakers at a candy factory lab, but with a lurking background of cheap-tasting acrid grain. This, my first impression of the TerrePURE technology, is that in the process of stripping unwanted by-products of bourbon distillation, they’ve also stripped much of what makes a whiskey taste like bourbon. This leaves you with a kind of bourbon-flavored corn brandy. Weird, and not very pleasant if you’re expecting bourbon. If you’re used to flavored vodka, this might not taste awful, but you’d be far better off buying something like ']"
497,Wolfburn Aurora ,"[': Resinous, slightly rancid sherry with some tannic red wine. Beneath that, red berries and caramel malt.

Robust tongue burn up front, which resolves into cinnamon extract, powdered ginger, and berry jam over a thin layer of malt. Eclectic. Feels incomplete.', ': On the short side. Cane sugar (molasses), and mild oak tannins. Fades vaguely, without resolution.', ': A few drops of water wake up the sherry a bit – adding fruit – and also round out the vanilla sweetness in the aroma. The palate also seems fuller and more dynamic. Water highly recommended with this one.', ': This feels like a young malt that shows older on the stage, but which has been contaminated by an inferior cask of sherry that left most of the fruit in the wine and presents largely off-putting rancio and resin notes. It is possible to drink this and ignore these elements, but the experience seems incomplete. Perhaps older malt left in ex-bourbon for longer would have stood up to, or better incorporated, the sherry. I was thoroughly lucky to obtain a closeout bottle of this for $30, which is really the exact price point where this belongs. If market forces and industry overhead didn’t force new and craft distillers to overcharge, the market would consist of much more good, fairly-priced whisky. Alas, that’s not the world we live in. I am looking forward to seeing what 6 or 8 year-old Wolfburn is like, but I won’t be dropping $50 on any 3 year-old from the distillery.']"
498,Woodford Reserve Bourbon ,[]
499,Woodford Reserve Bourbon (Revisited) ,"[': Toasted marshmallow. Marzipan, cherry pits. Candied apple (the red kind). Over all of that is a blanket of paint thinner or fresh plastic.', ': Sweet, medium bodied. Almost syrupy. Oak and cashew butter up front, then dried apple, and barrel char.', ': Medium-long. Continuing flavors from the palate – dried apple, nuts, oak and barrel char. Fades with slight bitterness, some more plastic-like flavors, and a little tobacco.', ': A splash of water really wakes up the cherry notes. Fresh, tart cherries as well as dried ones. However, it adds some extra paint thinner / varnish on the palate and a slight rotten fruit note that fades quickly. Ups the bitterness of the charcoal notes. Try this one both with and without water to see how it works for you.', ': First, I should note that my original review was done from a 50ml sample “airline” bottle. This time, from a full 750ml glass bottle, I thought the aromas and flavor were a little more in line with what I expect from a bourbon. There is a nice balance of acidity from the fruit notes (mostly cherry and apple) and the intense nuttiness on the front of the palate. Unfortunately, this is waylaid by what I call “paint thinner”, which is really a slightly bitter, slightly chemical aroma and flavor that I get when tasting especially cheap (although this is not cheap) spirits. This does make an excellent cocktail, where the sweetness, fruit, and nuttiness comes through, although for the price you’re probably better off with a bottle of ', ' tastes, although if you don’t detect the plastic/chemical notes that I get, you’d probably find this to be a quite tasty bourbon and worth your money. I’d be the first to admit that my 2011 review was flawed but after tasting from a full bottle, I’ll have to stick to my conclusions.']"
500,Woodford Reserve Double Oaked ,"[': Dark chewy molasses cookies or gingersnaps. Intense, nutty, and with a piercing tart note like apple cider vinegar. Woody; that extra maturation in new oak does seem to intensify the oak aromas.', ': Thin body. Lump charcoal up front, almost smoky. Then, sweetness shines through with molasses, pancake syrup, and toffee. Moderate tongue burn (appropriate for 45-ish percent ABV).', ': Of medium length. Very woody, with a lot of drying, antiseptic tannins. The sugar manages to keep pace, as does the not-quite-bitter charcoal. Even that vinegar note persists. Fades slowly without evolving.', ': Several drops of water have no apparent effect on the aroma, and simply mute the tongue burn on the palate. This bodes well for its ability to work in cocktails or handle ice.', ': A robust, intense, and woody bourbon that reminds me of a budget ']"
501,Woodford Reserve Rye ,"[': Baking spices greet the nose, in classic rye fashion. Deeper in, there is a strong cherry liqueur aroma, plus marzipan, dry corn, and a malty-but-not-too-sweet grain presence. Beneath this is a vegetal layer of mild sweet grass and – weird – dill.', ': Medium bodied. Distinct tongue burn (I would have said this was 50% ABV), which starts out dry and slightly bitter, and then turns malty and sweet and mildly bitter (fruity bitters, though, like Angostura or Peychaud’s). ', ': Medium-short in length. Spicy, with cinnamon red-hots and clove, fading into ginger (candied; dried). Not overly bitter on the finish.', ': Several drops of water open up a little vanilla buttercream frosting and some dark, sticky caramel notes on the aroma. The palate seems fuller and somewhat sweeter. The finish unchanged. I recommend a little water with this – at 45-ish% ABV, it can’t hurt.', ': The aroma (ignore the dill, that’s probably just me) is a nice full balance of dry rye spices with welcome bourbon-y cherry and oak. The “bitters” flavors on the palate are interesting – as if the glass were just an ice cube and a teaspoon of sugar away from being an Old Fashioned. It’s unusual, but welcome. That bitterness is adequately balanced with oaky sweetness. The finish is run-of-the-mill, if on the short side. The occasional green/vegetal note means the batch could use some additional time in oak, but the effect is faint and I’m just nitpicking. This is a decent sipper, and at a well-chosen strength makes a fine choice for your Manhattans.']"
502,Woodinville Straight Bourbon ,"[': Deeply oaky, with buckets of buttery, resinous, caramel-rich oak sugars. The rye notes also come through as pine sap, caraway, and clove. ', ': Silky body. A reprise of the aroma’s array of woody sweetness, plus a new (requisite, for bourbon) cherry syrup note. Subsequent tastings reveal a marshmallow note.', ': Medium-long. Classic bourbon. Sweet, woody, and with a layer of cherry pie filling. These three elements linger, together, for awhile before fading with a hint of menthol.', ': A few drops of water add even more sweetness to the aroma, in the form of vanilla extract. The palate and finish seem unaffected.', ': This is quintessential, unadorned bourbon that ticks every box but does not stand out, either. There are no off-notes and everything is in the expected balance of corn sweetness and oak. Unlike ']"
503,Woodinville Straight Rye ,"[': Unctuous, dripping, sticky cherries. Fresh apple cider. A hint of eucalyptus. Some rye spices – clove, allspice, cinnamon – but in their candied form. A good amount of complexity – there are aromas I can’t name – an appropriate nose tickle, and no off-notes. Balanced. Holy crud it’s even better after a rest in the glass.', ': Medium body. A strong tongue burn – tastes more like 50% ABV – followed by a full jar of maraschino cherries including the syrup. Tart, fruity, spiced. Yum.', ': Medium length. A reprise of the same. Damned if this whiskey ain’t consistent. A little nuttiness as the flavors fade, including only the barest amount of not-even-bitter charcoal. Oaky, at last, but without tannins.', ': A few drops of water – is it possible? – increase the candied fruit notes, adding some fruit punch. The palate seems thinner, the finish sweeter. Water is not needed here, really, but also doesn’t hurt.', ': Wow. Just… what? Wow. This stuff is amazing, and it’s only $40? And it’s “craft”?! Why has nobody told me about this before? Ok… calm down, Noob. $40 is a bit high considering the quality straight ryes available at nearly half the price (']"
504,Writers’ Tears Cask Strength (2014 Release) Irish Whiskey ,"[': Abundantly apple-y, with both fresh crunchy apple and farmyard cider. Hot, with a lot of grain on the nose and a large-ish helping of vodka-slash-paint-thinner, which largely dissipates with a rest in the glass. Some caramel, dried coconut, and ripe banana. A rest in the glass also reveals a not-quite-bitter walnut note and butterscotch frosting.', ': Medium bodied, waxy or oily. Big flavor here – cascades of nuts (pecan, walnut), meaty coconut, unfiltered apple cider, some bitter barrel char, and chewy burnt caramel and toffee. The bitterness grows, alas, as the taste evolves. Quite tame at 53% ABV, very drinkable.', ': Medium-long. The black walnut and bitter charcoal persist, quite obscuring the rest. Fades unpleasantly with more of the same.', ': A small splash of water has little apparent effect on the aroma. The palate is softer, with less burn, and arrives sweeter. Still, it progresses into more and more bitterness despite the water, ending much the same way. The finish carries perhaps a touch of apple that wasn’t noticeable before. Water neither helps nor hurts this one.', ': I would have been upset to purchase this for the suggested retail amount, and would not likely consider a different year without solid assurances that batch differences would resolve all of the negatives here. First, a nose with heavy amounts of ethanol that must be allowed to dissipate. Second, a progressive bitter flavor on the palate. Third, a finish dominated by more bitterness. On the plus side, the (partial) single pot-still heritage is evident in the coconut notes and waxy/oily palate, and the clarity and punch of Irish single malt delivers excellent apple notes. Still, ']"
505,Writers’ Tears Irish Whiskey ,"[': Reticent nose, even after a rest in the glass. Green apple, soft caramels, a prominent nose tickle (hot), indeterminate nuttiness, and a very faint cadre of spices: caraway (odd) and clove. ', ': Thin body. A lot more flavor than was promised by the aroma; graham cracker, brown sugar, meaty hazelnuts, crystallized sugars but without being “sweet”. It seems a bit austere, likely from that vaunted Irish triple-distillation, but holds its own with a well-balanced assortment of sweets and nuts.', ': Short. A tinge of single pot-still oils, a faint reminder that the category exists, but is otherwise lost here. Meaty and nutty, with hay and fresh cracked oats.', ': A few drops of water have little effect on the aroma beyond increasing the nose tickle. The palate seems a little confused, and the finish acquires only a hint of bubble gum. Skip the water.', ': A reasonably flavorful dram with a disappointing aroma. I could wish they’d skipped the single-malt portion of the vatting and held back on the watering-down. It might have been worth its $40 price tag at 46% ABV. There is a ']"
506,Wyoming Whiskey Small Batch Bourbon ,"[': Satisfyingly deep wheater aroma – butterscotch and caramel, fresh-baked scones and dripping vanilla frosting. The aroma has no characteristics of “young” spirits: no grassiness or acetone, and at this bottling strength is round and fully present in the nose. After a rest in the glass, there is the faintest aroma of dried apricots.', ': A tinge of oaky tannin upfront, which is washed over by waves of soft grains with a sweet sugary glaze. Not cloying, but distinctly sweet (not dry, or spicy). A tad hot for 44% ABV.', ': Of medium length, and warming. No bitterness here, just echoes of the bakery treats and vanilla notes. Pleasant and well-made.', ': Several drops of water reveal dusty dried apples and blood orange peels, and dampen some of the sweetness. The water also tames some of the tongue burn, so a few drops don’t go amiss here.', ': An impressive whisky for a seven year-old distillery. A five year-old bourbon with this much sweetness and elegance, no spirity detractors of youth, and a $40 average price? Yes please! A solid Recommended, and if you’re from, live in, just kinda like, or have anything whatsoever to do with Wyoming, this is a Must Have for you!', ': Tom from Tom’s Foolery asked me to take another look at the Foolery and compare it to Wyoming Whisky. ']"
507,Yellow Spot Irish Whiskey ,"[': The Malaga wine cask effect is subtle but effective – soft fruits, mildly vinous, with a strong heart of butterscotch and buttery caramel. Like Green Spot, the cereal notes are in balance, and just this side of light. It bears little to no resemblance to Redbreast, despite the similar distillation. Deeper in the glass, there is an undercurrent of vanilla cake frosting.', ': A bit hot. Sweet, but not a body on the thin side. Hard candy, port reduction, and a ghost of sweetened coconut. Also, marshmallow.', ': Medium-long, with a nice carrying presence of candied- apple shell, buttery oak, and butterscotch. Ends slightly bitter, with dry wood.', ': Water picks up the nose tickle, and adds a bit of red grape skin. Makes the palate and finish a little tannic. Water optional here.', ': The Malaga effect on this whisky is very similar to the port finish on ']"
508,Zuidam Millstone 100 Rye ,"[': Very shy, even with a rest in the glass. I can tease out a spirity note of graham cracker, with attendant cinnamon and clove. As it warms up, there is a little cracked black peppercorn and hot roasted almonds.', ': Syrupy body. Moderate tongue burn. More graham cracker, a spice cabinet array (primarily cinnamon), and only a faint cereal sweetness, reminding me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch breakfast cereal, only not as sugary.', ': Medium-long, warming. No bitterness, just a fading slideshow of spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, anise, mace, etc.).', ': Water has no effect on the nose, alas, or anywhere else. Water is fully optional with this.', ': A pretty standard well-made middle-aged rye. The usual suspects (spice notes) are in attendance, although they are so muted on the aroma that not much at all greets the nose. The body is unusually viscous and the finish unusually long, but other than that, you could swap this out with any other not-too-young rye without anyone noticing.']"
