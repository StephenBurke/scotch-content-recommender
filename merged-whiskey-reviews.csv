0,1792 Port Finish Bourbon - After just reviewing a port-finished bourbon I turn now to one of the (very few) other port-finished American whiskies the newly-released 1792 Port Finish bourbon (note that the bottle label and website has dropped the “Ridgemont Reserve” and the branding seems to be focusing on the “1792” part of the name). The same bourbon that goes into 1792 Small-Batch is aged for an additional 2 years in port wine barrels and then bottled at the odd choice of 44.45% ABV. The extra aging means a price premium so expect to shell out an additional $10 or so. That turns the very budget-friendly 1792 into a bit of a splurge for a bourbon.Nose Grape juice and grape jam on a bed of sweet corn and caramel. Quite sweet. After a rest in the glass a tart top note – like cranberry – creeps in.Palate A tad hot for ~44%. Grape Jolly Ranchers™ caramel-dipped apples and a slightly charcoal-flecked and dry bourbon profile.Finish Short. Oaky but not tannic. Echoes of sweet grape jam and semisweet chocolate. Fades quickly.With Water Water brings a little more nose tickle to the aroma without revealing anything new. The palate is a little softer. I suggest adding a touch of water and then letting it rest in the glass for a few minutes to reawaken the aroma.Overall Not quite as supple and polished as Angel’s Envy (the only other port-finished bourbon I’ve had) but successful in its own right. It takes a semi-robust dry bourbon and balances it nicely against a fruit-forward juicy sweet port. A win and well-priced but the port flavor disappears when used in cocktails which means this should be relegated to sipping or perhaps taken over ice. For cocktails stick to the basic 1792 Small Batch.
1,1792 Ridgemont Reserve Bourbon - I’m on a quest you see. Like Don Quixote I am on a mission to make the world a better place by pitting my “impressive” (insert sarcasm) tasting skills against a sea of bottom-shelf booze to deliver quality to beleaguered peasants (that’s you) whose pockets have been picked by $200 Macallan 18 and $120 limited edition bourbon. To that end I tilt windmills like Old Fitz and Old Forester (why are bourbon brands always old?) to bring you gems like this one.1792 Ridgemont Reserve is the highfalutin’ name (in a similarly highfalutin’ bottle) for the West Coast US’s version of the acclaimed value brand Very Old Barton Bottled-in-Bond affectionately known as “VOB BIB” and only available on the vaguely Eastern half of the US. 1792 Ridgemont Reserve is the same mashbill as VOB but aged 2 extra years and bottled at a slightly lower proof (VOB is 100 proof). Since I cannot get and have never tasted VOB this will have to do.This bottling from the Barton distillery in Bardstown Kentucky is named after the year Kentucky became a state. The Barton distillery is owned by Sazerac (Buffalo Trace) but only produces a few brands most of which stays out East. It’s around eight years old (it used to have an age statement which was dropped in 2013) and comes from a high-rye recipe.Bottle note despite the awkward shape of the bottle I really like the woven “scarf” around the neck – it makes it so easy to pour.Nose Salted caramels. Nougat. Mild oak lightly sweet. Hint of acetone. Not exactly a “study it over the course of an evening” type of aroma but simple and sweet.Palate Silky medium-bodied. Oaky up front and a bit hot at first. Then nougat-y taffy and rich corn. The corn here is syrupy and round and not plastic or industrial.Finish Medium-long. Nut skins light caramel fading with a bit of charcoal. Not bitter.With Water A splash of water adds a vegetal note to the nose – like raw green split firewood. It utterly removes the tongue burn but at the expense of some flavor. Water (or ice) is optional with this one when drinking straight up.Overall I wouldn’t exactly buy a bottle of this for exclusive sipping. However it makes a graceful easygoing dram AND a top-notch cocktail which makes it the golden intersection of value bourbon for me. It has none of the aspects of cheap bourbon that always put me off – the over-oaked bitterness the rough high-octane grainy alcohol the acetone (well maybe a bit) or the fake-candy high-fructose corn syrup flavor. It’s just straightforward sweet silky and mixes flawlessly into an Old Fashioned or a bourbon Manhattan. Alas it’s more expensive than VOB so it doesn’t win any “value” awards. If you can get VOB leave this one in the dust. If you can’t 1792 Ridgemont Reserve is an acceptable substitute.
2,8 Seconds (Sec8nds) Canadian Whisky - Glutton for punishment that I am I continued down the unforgiving road of blended Canadian whisky with another product aimed at the apparently whisky-starved rodeo market. “8 Seconds” (although the bottle label had me trying to pronounce “Sec8nds” for longer than I’m comfortable admitting) is the younger sibling of the 8 year-old “8 Seconds Black”. Like Pendleton the website is rife with scenes from cowboy bars rodeo imagery and cowboy hats. The whisky? Apparently it’s aged in oak barrels blended in “small batches” and has developed “elegant nuances” of what they don’t specify. But never mind that we have pictures of hot girls on mechanical bulls!Also the bottle is very pretty.Nose Sweet. Soft melty buttery caramel. And… yeah that’s it.Palate Soft texture. Thankfully not ultra-sweet although the overall impression is of cake-y baked goods. German chocolate cake frosting?Finish Short. Brown sugar melting away to reveal a core of pretty young grassy grain whisky. Ends with straight vodka notes.With Water Dampens the aroma. No effect on the palate maybe turns up the vegetal notes on the finish.Overall This is the first “blended Canadian whisky” that I’ve had (ever) that doesn’t make me want to wash my mouth out. That said it desperately calls for ice and a bitter or acidic ingredient to balance the inherent sweetness. I would wager that if you wanted to make a cocktail that called for Crown Royal you’d be slightly better off using this. I wouldn’t bother to drink it straight though especially with that vodka finish. Even so it’s better than direct competitor Pendleton in my book. I’m now curious about the “Black” label from 8 Seconds.
3,A.D. Rattray: Craigellachie (8 year) - The third in my brief series on A.D. Rattray bottlings of little-known but active distilleries. (See Glen Ord and Macduff reviewed earlier). Like the other two most people have never even heard of Craigellachie (Creg – alla – key). The distillery is now owned by Bacardi and the new owners have begun releasing distillery-labelled bottlings (although I’ve never seen one in the USA). Of the three I liked this one most. It showed complexity and an eclectic personality with Sherry influence present but not overwhelming. Its relative youth served only to brighten flavors. A good example of why older is not always better.Like the previously-reviewed A.D. Rattray malts this is bottled at cask-strength (59.6% ABV) and has no color added or chill-filtration. Go A.D. Rattray!Update The distillery now has an official line of expressions. Here’s a review of the 13-year.Distilled 8/20/2002 Bottled 5/17/2011Nose Anise Lime juice. Not too prickly despite youth. Gold raisins. Marshmallow and loads of vanilla frosting.Palate Soft with good alcohol integration for an 8 year-old. Great soft sugars specifically raw cane and simple syrup. Powdered sugar? Gold raisins.Finish Not too much burn and medium-long. A little wood bitterness on the tail end the only noticeable flaw.With Water The addition of water dulls the bright flavors a bit too much for me. I’d skip the water.Overall Nicely complex. This whisky does not toe the line of Speyside style instead branching out in eclectic ways. Raw cane? Anise and lime juice? I would not have pegged this as a sherried Speysider. Very interesting although the novelty might wear off after paying $66 for a full bottle. Certainly worth trying especially if you’d like to cross another distillery off of your bucket list.
4,A.D. Rattray: Glen Ord (12 year) - Glen what? One of the little-known intricacies of scotch whisky is that not all distilleries are created equal. Ask anyone on the street to name some single-malts and they’ll likely come up with Glenfiddich and Glenlivet and maybe The Macallan. Glen Ord? Not likely. The reason generally is that a large amount of the malt whisky produced in Scotland goes directly into blends. In fact up until the single-malt renaissance of the last few decades Scottish malt whisky was produced solely for the purpose of blending. Only occasionally did unblended malt end up on the shelves of independent bottlers and grocers and even then it was often labelled with the bottler’s brand not the distillery. The same is still true today of some malts which are kept running exclusively for the purpose of feeding the huge demand for Scottish brands of blended whisky.Glen Ord a northern Highland distillery owned by Diageo finds itself mostly used for the Dewar’s blend. Its middle-of-the-road highland style of vanilla bakery sweets and soft wood make it a perfect candidate for successful blending. Diageo does now release some Glen Ord as a single in its “Hidden Malts” line and some is available from independent bottlers. I was able to taste an A.D. Rattray bourbon-cask release of 12 year-old Glen Ord at a recent K&L spirits tasting in Redwood City CA. It was bottled at cask strength (60.1% ABV) with no coloring or chill-filtration. Just the way I like ’em.Distilled 03/17/1998 Bottled 10/30/2010 Cask #24Nose Unctuous layers of vanilla white cake batter vanilla frosting white peach and pale soft wood. Very inoffensive and clean.Palate More of the same. Light and sweet. Not fruity at all but reminiscent of angel’s food cake sugar cookies and white tea.Finish Almond marzipan… suddenly VERY nutty! Cashew butter? Unexpected nuttiness. Medium-long.Overall I don’t really consider mild 12 year-old Highlanders without complexity to be worth $60 a bottle so I can’t say I would shell out for this. However there are exactly zero flaws in the presentation here and if you’re trying to check every distillery off your list this one may be worth seeking out. Also it’s surprising how easy-drinking it is even at cask-strength 60.1% ABV.
5,A.D. Rattray: Macduff (10 year) - Like the A.D. Rattray bottling of Glen Ord reviewed earlier Macduff is another barely-known distillery operating largely to provide whisky for blending. In this case the William Lawson’s blend. Independent bottlers serve the whisky lover by providing access to rare or rarely-released whisky which can be both a blessing and a curse. Without a “standard” expression these are usually single-casks chosen and aged by the bottler. This means they can vary widely in quality and require the buyer to rely on the bottler’s reputation.This bottle a sherry-finished expression of Speysider Macduff at 10 years of age uses craft presentation (cask-strength at 59.8% ABV without added color or chill-filtration). Distilled 11/15/2000 Bottled 04/05/2011Nose Pine. Vanilla butterscotch. Where’s the sherry?Palate Tongue burn is a little rough like a younger malt. Touches of grape skins and then light sherry (a little like watered-down red wine). Youngish bright red fruits. A little nutty plum pits?Finish Somewhat continues the burn. Not very smooth. Echoes of palate notes leaving an impression of sugared plums and tannin from grape skins.With Water A little more bitterness develops on the finish. Lemon peel red berries on the tongue. The body becomes a little meaty which is nicer. Try it with water.Overall Not a great introduction to Macduff. It’s hard to say if the few unpleasant notes were a result of cask choice or simply reflect the distillery style. If I had spent $66 on a bottle of this I might be disappointed. At least it’s cask strength and craft presentation.
6,Aberlour (10 year) - While at C.B. Hannegan’s in Los Gatos CA (GREAT Single-Malt selection) I tried a glass of the Aberlour 10 year. I have had a great deal of the distillery’s A’Bunadh expression which is a vatting of Aberlour whiskies from a range of ages (10 to 15 years) and bottled at cask strength (a whopping ~60% ABV). I wanted to see how the distillery’s 10-year bottle-strength (40% ABV) expression compared.Update Read a new review of the Aberlour 12 year here.Color OrangeNose Sherry orange peel tangerine sherbet.The palate is very similar to the A’Bunadh heavy on the sherry a little oak some cherry and citrus not nearly as much burn developing with more fruit on the tongue.Really long finish mostly sherry but also raspberry and hops.Overall I like this dram and would have wanted a bottle… except that this one doesn’t stand out against an array of similar sherried Speysiders. I feel there are more expressive whiskies in this price range from Speyside (The Macallan for example) and since the A’Bunadh gives all of these flavors and more I can’t see a spot on my shelf for it. Unfortunately for me the 10-year doesn’t stand up to its cask-strength older brother even with the price difference.
7,Aberlour (12 year) - Ten full years ago I reviewed Aberlour 10-year on this blog as one of my first posts. Amazing how time flies. My ‘review’ was about 2 sentences long the bar that I bought the dram at doesn’t exist any more and Aberlour 10 is no longer available in the US (although it is available in the UK). Also I referred to its color as “orange”. Yikes.I found a nice deal on the 12 year recently and thought I’d give Aberlour another shot to prove to me that it’s not only good for a’bunadh. (Would that really be so bad?) This a “double-cask matured” single malt is basically their answer for the now nearly-ubiquitous trend of thinning out your expensive sherried whisky with some not-quite-as-expensive ex-bourbon whisky as pioneered by The Balvenie DoubleWood line. That makes it sound more cynical than it is ex-bourbon casks can lend buttery caramel notes and a wider array of flavors to balance out the effects of a wine cask.This Aberlour is aged in two separate cask types “Traditional Oak” which is a funny way of saying ex-bourbon American Oak casks and ex-Sherry casks. These are aged for 12 years and then married together in undisclosed proportions before bottling at the legal minimum 40% ABV. Interestingly every expression in Aberlour’s official lineup is now labelled as a “Double Cask” whisky with the exception of a’bunadh. This may be their way of dealing with the expanding crisis of the Sherry barrel shortage in the whisky industry. Also the website subtly refers to the sherry casks as “seasoned” which usually means they are filled with sherry or a sherry-like wine and aged for short periods with the throwaway wine before being used to age whisky. To read more check out Westland distillery’s thoughts on the current market for sherry casks.Nose Fruity with a ton of red grapefruit cape gooseberry kiwi and decadent refined honey. Very floral as well with a heady cloud of lemon verbena and honeysuckle. All of the fruits seem fresh and tart as opposed to the usual Aberlour dark red and black fruits. This is downright summery.Palate Syrupy body. Honey again with almost no tongue burn at all. Dried apricots and golden figs replace the tart fruits from the aroma. There is a faint layer of oakiness mostly with notes of cinnamon and vanilla.Finish Medium-short. The finish is a little muddled. The fruit notes are not clear and the spicy oak notes are now marred with slightly acrid bitterness. Ends somewhat quickly without evolving. This situation improves with further sips which build up a little more sweetness to balance the bitterness.With Water A few drops of water mix up the fruits and flowers on the aroma – making them harder to place. The palate seems thinner but the finish has more fruit. I would probably skip the water since I liked the aroma so much in the first place.Overall Despite the low ABV I would not call this watery or lacking in potency. The aroma is lovely and deeply perfumed the palate competent and well-composed but the finish is an outright disappointment. That said the price is dead on and I don’t feel like the 40% ABV is unduly low in this case. I do think Balvenie DoubleWood 12 edges this one out in terms of polish and overall delivery but if the Aberlour is significantly cheaper in your area then it’s probably a better buy.If we treat this as an entry-level malt and assume an entry-level price then this is a solid ‘Recommended’. Just don’t expect to be wowed beyond the aroma.
8,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 29) - A’Bunadh means “Of the Origin” in Gaelic. It is bottled at cask strength from a vatting (mixture) of Aberlour malts from varying ages (10 to 15 years old). These are all aged in barrels that once held oloroso sherry. Each bottling run (indicated by a batch number on the bottle) will have slightly different alcohol by volume ranging from 59.3% to 60.9%. Each batch will also vary in flavor according to the whims of the whiskymaker and the individual characteristics of the source casks. An unsubstantiated rumor holds that a hidden bottle of Aberlour whisky from 1898 was discovered during construction in the still room that the workmen drank a majority of it and that A’Bunadh is an attempt by the distillery to re-create the flavor and texture of that historic malt.(My bottle is from Batch Number 29 bottled in 2010 59.9% ABV)Color Mahogany The aroma is sweet and syrupy like brown sugar cookies baking. Nose-burning alcohol and a twinge of cherry or cherry-wood. Strongly perfumed rose pollen. Acetone.The attack is fiery unyielding. The body is syrupy and rich coating your mouth like napalm. As it resolves on your palate though it opens up with fruit and oak rich plum red apple caramel treacle toffee and red pepper. Intense and intensely flavorful.The finish is long and caramelly hints of candy apple and molasses. It heats your throat and warms your belly. It also tenaciously clings to the inside of your cheeks and continues to smolder. This is a whisky to conquer.Adding a dash of water does not reveal anything new in the aroma to me nor does it tame any of the fire. If you’re going to tackle this one tackle it neat.
9,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 30) - (My bottle is from Batch Number 30 at 59.8% ABV)Color Mahogany Nose Heady aroma. Blackberry syrup. Definite sherry character with overtones of antique wood sap stewed dark fruits maple sugar candies and a hint of candied orange peel or orange liqueur.Body Full and mouth-coating but not oily. That cask-strength mouth-puckering burn is in full force.Palate Packed with those dark jammy stewed fruits. Blackberry jelly on buttered scones. Black cherry-flavored salt-water taffy.Finish The oak comes on strong tannins and dark red grape skins. The finish is long evolving into lighter sherry and rose wine notes some strawberry and finally some clove and allspice.Adding a little water doesn’t open up anything floral – the sherry likely overwhelms anything so subtle. It does seem to wreck the fullness of the body and I don’t get anything new from the flavor. Note If you dilute it down to approximately 40% ABV it gets downright dull No fruits no spices a little sherry and some malt alcohol. Don’t do it.While the batch characteristics are slightly different from the previous batch 29 with more jammy fruit notes a bigger oak influence and a lighter sherry intensity the quality remains at the same high level and I continue to recommend this product highly. It also seems (or is it just me?) to be a little cheaper on the shelf than the 29?
10,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 41) - For background on A’Bunadh see my reviews of Batches 29 and 30. It’s no secret that Aberlour A’Bunadh (pronounced as the rep from Pernod Ricard stressed… several times… A-ber-LAU-er Ah BOON Ar) is one of my favorite whiskies. I figured that after writing about batches 29 AND 30 that I wouldn’t revisit the brand unless I someday bought another bottle. Serendipitously (how often do you get to use THAT word?) the Pernod Ricard rep at a recent K&L Tasting was pouring both Scapa 16 and the new batch 41 of my old friend A’Bunadh!As a reminder A’Bunadh is bottled at cask strength from a vatting (mixture) of Aberlour malts from varying ages (10 to 15 years old). 100% of the malt is aged in barrels that once held oloroso sherry. Each bottling run (indicated by a batch number on the bottle) will have slightly different alcohol by volume ranging from 58.9% to 60.9%. Each batch will also vary in flavor according to the whims of the whiskymaker and the individual characteristics of the source casks.(This tasting is from the recent Batch Number 41 bottled in 2012 at 59% ABV)Nose Coffee grounds and balsamic reduction. Dark chocolate nibs. Black cherry. Much darker notes and less fresh or red fruit than previous batches but arguably more interesting.Palate Familiar mouth-puckering raspberry sour dark oak drying tannin and strawberry. Just like old times.Finish Very long with raisin and resin. Mouth-drying tannins. The fruit here is dried and concentrated and doused in sticky caramelized sugar. Ends with some faint marshmallow (from the oak influence).With Water Slightly lighter fruits; brings out strawberry in the nose. Reveals balsamic vinegar on the palate and somewhat tames the burn.Overall Not as much of a sherry bomb as previous batches but more complex and brooding. Still burns like sweet sweet fire. The price is not as approachable as days gone by but $60 for a fantastic sherried cask-strength whisky is still not a bad deal. I continue to recommend this malt highly.
11,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 57) - As the coming nuptials of my brother-in-law approach I am reminded of the second dram he introduced me to back when my knowledge of scotch started and stopped with Johnnie Walker. Not one to play anything cautiously he first had me take a glass of Laphroaig 10 year. Amazingly I wasn’t dissuaded so his second recommendation was an A’Bunadh at a raucous 59.9% ABV. I remember that the burn was like nothing I had experienced before – carefully painting every recess of my mouth with boiling tar – and I also remember being amazed and shocked that swallowing that blazing liquid inferno had no negative effect on my throat… filling me instead with a comforting warming glow. “That was not like taking shots” I remember thinking. “This is the way alcohol is meant to be enjoyed.” It would not be far off to say that those two glasses of nectar launched my fascination with single malt and led directly to my writing this blog.I look forward to sharing a bottle of something single malt and Scottish – perhaps even an A’Bunadh – with my brother-in-law as he buckles on that ball and chain is welcomed into the arms of wedded bliss.I wish I could review every batch of A’Bunadh but I would be literally drinking nothing BUT A’Bunadh. This bottle of Batch 57 caught my eye during my last trip to my favorite liquor store and reminded me that I haven’t reviewed a batch in awhile. Checking past posts I see that I’ve missed 15 (!) prior batches as my last review was Batch 41. At a resounding 60.7% ABV this is also the strongest A’Bunadh I’ve tried. As always this is aged exclusively in Spanish oloroso sherry casks and bottled at cask strength with no chill filtration.You can read my reviews of Batch 29 Batch 30 and Batch 41 for more background on the A’Bunadh.Nose Deeply raisiny with more rancio and balsamic than prior batches. STRONG nose tickle – need to keep nose out of the glass. Smells drier – less fresh/vibrant fruit and more oakiness and dried fruit. Deep in the glass – if you dare – there is a layer of unctuous gooey caramel and fudge brownie.Palate Syrupy body. Salted caramel and… OH GOD IT BURNS. Ok… once that’s out of the way the seared remnants of my tongue pick up deep sugary oak (maple syrup but not maple) dusty dried prunes and raisins faint fig jam sawdust and birch beer.Finish A layer of sooty charcoal that resolves into mouth-drying tannins cocoa nibs and an odd absence of fruit. Further sips confirm – lots of chocolate and oak no fruit. Weird.With Water Several drops of water amps up the nose tickle but also sweetens the aroma adding fudgy frosting and a touch more fruit. It still burns like fire on the tongue but the few fruit notes are brighter – more jelly than jam. The finish picks up a nice apple/cinnamon note and isn’t quite as dry. This batch benefits immensely from water. At this ABV you could probably use splashes instead of drops but taste as you go.Overall I have to say as much as I love A’Bunadh this is not my favorite batch. I’m a sucker for big fresh fruit in my sherried drams or heavily jammy/concentrated fruit flavors. This has neither. Although the chocolate notes are welcome and the flavor is as powerful and dense as always the whole comes across as drier woodier and with less fruit than usual. Reminds me more of a mid-aged (~15 yr) Glenfarclas than an Aberlour. Still a good dram just not up to my usual A’Bunadh standards
12,Aberlour Casg Annamh (Batch 1) - I drink so much Aberlour A’bunadh that I sometimes forget the distillery makes other whisky. This one a new permanent member of the Aberlour lineup (although oddly not yet listed on the website) is an NAS sherried single malt bottled at 48%. The Gaelic name (which seems to be par-for-the-course with legitimizing NAS whiskies) means ‘rare cask’. The whisky is aged in some inscrutable combination of European and American oak casks some of which held sherry at one time. The “two types” of American Oak could refer to refill and first-fill or it could mean ex-bourbon American oak casks that have been “seasoned” by sloshing some re-used sherry around in them. The whisky is bottled without added coloring or chill filtration.The price launched at $65 suggests to jaded consumers such as myself that Abelour is looking to entice A’bunadh adherents to a cheaper-to-make product. A’bunadh seems to have increased to the $75-$80 range and Aberlour may be hoping that fans will accept Casg Annamh at the old price point minus some sherry influence and ABV. Non-jaded consumers may welcome a new member to the Aberlour lineup and write off the price increases to the current market trend as a whole. I’ll leave it to you to decide how jaded you are.My sample was from a Flaviar Tasting Box and is labelled “Lot 18/10/20110”. I’m not sure if that’s Flaviar gibberish or what but this is from Casg Annamh Batch 1.Nose Balsam and juniper berry strike the nose first but the aroma is shy and seems to require a rest in the glass. After said rest there is mild sweet grape jam cherry Jolly Ranchers peanut butter baked goods like ‘blondie’ brownies soft butterscotch and a hint of banana. All of which remains shy and hard to tease out or muddy and confused.Palate Syrupy body. A moderate tongue burn is followed by sugar cookie dough Red Vines red candy apples and herbaceous throat lozenges. Again muddy and confused.Finish Medium-short. Some charcoal bitterness flecked with root beer and powdered cinnamon. Little fruit. Fades without much fanfare leaving a bit of menthol.With Water A few drops of water bring out a distinct fresh hay note in the aroma but not much else. The palate is cleaner with some licorice the finish rounder. Water doesn’t hurt but it also doesn’t fix what’s wrong here.Overall I’m not used to Aberlour being shy and to add insult to injury this is no sherry bomb. This seems to be an unsuccessful merging of sherried and ex-bourbon styles where the best elements of each is squashed by the presence of the other. The notes that I can detect are fleeting and inconsistent. I could imagine that midway through a full bottle of this one would come to appreciate its core complexity… but a sample is insufficient to do it justice. I am left without much desire to find a full bottle especially when A’bunadh and Aberlour 12 are still available.I usually don’t read the notes of other reviewers but I couldn’t help but notice the Internet at large seems to be on board with Casg Annamh. Perhaps they all sprung for a full bottle and it grew on them or perhaps a “softer” and “easier” A’bunadh is something that people other than me want. Take my review with a grain of salt and read some of those others before making a decision.
13,Alberta Rye Dark Batch Canadian Whisky - And now for something completely different. I’ve made fun of Canadian whisky in the past because of the slightly lax laws which allow Canadian distillers to mix things into their whisky that would make the SWA (Scotch Whisky Association) choke on its daily dram. Then along comes a product that shows the upside of such a liberal policy. Rather than try to explain exactly what’s in this I refer you to Drinkhacker’s excellent description. Suffice it to say this is two types of Canadian rye (12 years and 6 year of age) blended with 8% bourbon (actual bourbon purportedly Old Grand-Dad) and 1% sherry (actual sherry). Try getting something like that past the US’s TTB labeling review!We have something unique here people. Everyone knows that some whisky (specifically scotch) is aged in sherry barrels (some of which are “wet” with residual liquid sherry) but who puts actually sherry in the vat with the whisky? Who’s actually allowed to do that? Canadian distillers that’s who.Nose A robust – dare I say “bold”? – aroma of fungal wine caves sweet fortified wine (duh) and soft sweet round Canadian “rye”. More fun than serious this smells like a glass of something a bunch of drunk whisky people would mix together after a particularly long cask-strength tasting. You can tell there’s sherry (as opposed to sherry cask-aged whisky) in here because the aromas are winey and with a dense fresh watery fruit note that one does not normally find in whisky. If you think of this like a bottled cocktail the effect is quite pleasant and very well-integrated.Palate Syrupy body. Black raisins pine resin soft wheat and red wine dregs. After the initial (very tame) tongue burn there is some malty cereal sweetness like marshmallows and coconut shavings.Finish Long-ish. The sherry pervades with raisins resinous sappy wood and the barest reminder that this is rye cloves. Fades without bitterness.With Water A few drops of water bring very sweet melted vanilla ice cream to the nose along with a heightened sense of rye spice (cinnamon primarily). muting the “wet” sherry notes. The palate is downright “smooth” (aka doesn’t burn) with a little water but no new notes appear. Water is fully optional here.Overall I think the best way to think of Dark Batch is as a bottled cocktail and a damn good one at that. A masterful balance of dark resinous sherry with your typical round sweet Canadian rye. At a very reasonable price this is something that could form a tasty satisfying drink neat or as a component in some unique cocktails. In fact it’s quite pleasant by itself on ice.I’ve marked it “Must Try” because this defies classification and is really something every whisky lover ought to experience. This is especially true of every whisky lover (guilty) who has ever tried to tip a little fresh sherry into a glass of whisky to see what happens. (Hint It didn’t go well).
14,Alchemist: The Macallan (15 year) - Alchemist is a small independent bottler known for an eclectic catalog which includes not only whisky but calvados rum and armagnac as well. Their 16 year-old Highland Park finished in Calvados (French apple brandy) bottles is one of the finest whiskies I’ve ever tried (review upcoming). It’s also one of the bottles that I hear talked about most frequently around K&L Wines in Redwood City. Alas it’s long gone. When K&L had a closeout on Alchemist a few months ago I picked up the Highland Park and also this one a simple Macallan 15. Like the distillery 18 this had been matured exclusively in sherry butts.Nose Piquant old concentrated sherry. Meatier than distillery-bottled releases from The Macallan. This is a little more like GlenDronach with some rubber caramelized onions and teriyaki jerky. Underneath there is a strong current of sweet plums raisins and smoked nuts. Very heavily sherried but not as candy-apple sweet as some Macallans.Palate On the tongue there is an abundance of nuts first hazelnut and then some darker notes of roasted almonds and chestnuts as well as cocoa nibs dense prunes brandy and a touch of molasses. Many of the aromas continue in the latter part of the palate with dark resinous meaty sherry notes.Finish A bit more fruity with the sweeter notes left on the tongue. Cherries raspberries and some lingering dried fruits peanut butter and a hint of rubber.With Water The nose becomes a tad sharper and only the lighter fruits some vanilla bean and a suggestion of rubber become detectable. The palate becomes far sweeter chocolate-covered cherries taffy port wine and hazelnut butter. The finish is unchanged. Definitely drink your fill without water first before trying a few drops as a curiosity. It’s better without the water in my opinion.Overall A very different and enjoyable alternative to distillery-released Macallan. It clearly deviates from the distillery profile of sweetness bright red fruit and elegant old sherry. Here there are wilder notes and sharper edges. Almost savory at times and eclectic. Luckily it never goes too far off course is never bitter or rancid and doesn’t contain any truly ‘off’ notes. An experience and an education in the wide range of flavors available from sherried scotch. Note that many of these flavors are available in the cheaper (and more readily available) GlenDronach distillery bottlings since it would be difficult to locate this particular bottle now that most of it has sold out.
15,Alexander Murray Bon Accord - The independent bottler Alexander Murray & Co. is probably best known for its pioneering work in large-scale independent bottling for Costco (Kirkland brand) and Trader Joe’s. I’ve reviewed a number of their products before and my impression of their work is medium-quality whisky for bottom-dollar prices. Sometimes that’s just what I’m after.With recent releases such as Polly’s Casks and this Bon Accord the company seems to be trying to branch out and make a standalone name for their own creative blending and barrel selection prowess rather than riding the Kirkland/TJs coat tails. Bon Accord here refers to the agreement that an independent bottler sometimes has to make with a whisky producer to not disclose the distillery name. The bottle has no age statement so all we really know is that it is a Highland single malt from an ex-bourbon barrel and that is bottled at the bare legal minimum of 40% ABV. The release is a vatting of different ages from that undisclosed distillery so it’s not a single barrel. There is only one batch of Bon Accord (so far) but the marketing material on the website seems to be positioning it as an entire range so I wouldn’t be surprised to see future batches from other “unnamed” distilleries.I spent some time sleuthing online looking for guesses as to what distillery this is from but I couldn’t find anything credible. There are so many Highland distilleries (technically could also be a Speysider). Still it’s worth noting that the Highland town of Aberdeen has had the phrase “Bon Accord” in its coat of arms since 1672. This only narrows it down a little. Fettercairn? Royal Lochnagar? Glenglassaugh? Ardmore? Probably not Knockdhu Glen Garioch or GlenDronach… but who knows.Nose Smells like a blend (it’s not). White peach stale hay green apple. Some banana after a rest in the glass. The rest also adds an aroma of fresh laundry but also a sense of watery blandness that suggests a lack of potency.Palate Silky mouthfeel. Very light tongue burn. Bananas foster up front with mild sweetness and a nice round cereal note. Pleasant if unremarkable. Forgettable even.Finish Short. Caramel and then a fading hint of black licorice. Some slight oaky bitterness.With Water A scant few drops of water wake up the nose a little with some extra alcohol tickle but no additional aromas. The mouthfeel is unaffected as is the flavor. The finish might have picked up a fruity twang. Water neither helps nor hurts here which is actually good news for those looking to drink theirs on the rocks.Overall A middle-of-the-road middling malt without much to say for itself. It’s not bad but it doesn’t exactly jump out of the glass either. It’s priced correctly under $30 but nothing about it justifies purchasing it over other options in that range. I do wish it were bottled at 46% ABV.A solid meh.
16,Alexander Murray: Mortlach (16 year) 1995 – 2011 - If I had the cash this blog would become The Mortlach Noob! If it weren’t for Diageo that might be possible but as I mentioned in last week’s review of a G&M Mortlach 15 year the official brand lineup announced in 2014 starts at $110. Ouch.This bottling at nearly half the price of the Gordon & MacPhail 15 year was distilled in 1995 and aged in “oak casks” according to the label (duh) for 16 years. After the tasting below it’s clear to me that these were ex-bourbon casks or perhaps 4th-refill sherry. That could account for the price difference between this and other sherried Mortlachs as the Alexander Murray is only $45! That’s a steal. I found this bottle at a Trader Joe’s in California but I believe Alexander Murray is expanding their retail presence and might be available elsewhere. I know I’ve seen some Alexander Murray bottlings at Costco although not this one.Nose Tannic slightly acidic oak. Something tart like apple cider vinegar meets the nose first and further digging is necessary to find the meaty/fruity notes that Mortlach is known for. Deeper in the glass I find dried apple slices fresh hay and a faint charry smokiness. Butterscotch makes an appearance but the overall aroma is not sweet.Palate Texturally heavy not quite oily. First there is a pleasant wave of toasty grains and cashew butter followed by more dried apple and dusty orange peel.Finish Warming; medium length. Roasted nuts spun sugar fading without bitterness.With Water Several drops of water seem to wash out the aroma leaving only faint hay. The palate becomes thinner and acquires only a waxy/glue note. The finish however is a little fruitier. I’d skip the water here. At 40% ABV it certainly doesn’t need it.Overall While it pales in a side-to-side comparison with classical sherry-aged Mortlach like the G&M 15 year this Murray bottling stands on its own with a very pleasing combination of roasted/toasted/meaty flavors and without cloying sweetness on the palate. This is a cautious “Recommended” based on the price-quality ratio. The nose and finish are a little anemic and the 40% ABV bottle strength was a mis-step but the price as they say is right.
17,Amrut ‘Intermediate Sherry Matured’ - You’ve got to hand it to a company willing to do crazy things with maturation to create an innovative product. Since flavoring additives are frowned upon in whisky (and against the law in Scotland) producers must use their aging barrels to impart character that isn’t present at the time of distillation. In most of the industry this means a long sleep in ex-bourbon barrels followed by a 1-year dip in a more exotic container such as port pipes rum casks or white wine barrels. Leave it to up-and-coming Indian malt whisky producer Amrut to turn this process on its head and sandwich an ex-sherry maturation in between two ex-bourbon maturations. This double-dip theoretically gives the sherry influence time to ‘burn in’ while the malt rests in the final bourbon barrel. The result (at a hefty 57.1% ABV) is pungent and fruity with intense dried fruits. So far the best Amrut I’ve had. Unfortunately it also comes with a $99 pricetag which is far more than I’d suggest paying for a full bottle unless you’re a big fan of this style.Thanks to Colin for organizing the Amrut Twitter Tasting and sending me the samples!Nose The sherry effect is apparent – deep figgy raisiny goodness over a layer of Amrut banana and cream. There are additional hints of coconut blueberry pound cake and a suggestion of tobacco. A dash of water – as is always the case with Amrut – yields waves of banana and a lot more sweetness… like vanilla taffy.Palate Creamy mouthfeel upfront another hit of tobacco leaf which is succeeded by the same dryness on the tongue I’ve seen with the other Amruts. When it resolves there is a nice blueberry syrup dark chocolate nibs dried fig fried plantain fresh blackberries and the everpresent banana. The water if anything draws out that banana.Finish Medium length. The sherry flavors turn slightly rancid on the finish also revealing a bit of bitterness. There is finally a moderate sweetness – roasted beets? Some hard wood tannins dry the walls of the mouth. On the tail end there is a final resonant note of juicy black raisin. Water sweetens the finish hiding some of those rancid notes.Overall Very different from sherry-finished Scotches I’ve had – the fruitiness is subdued and suggests dried rather than jammed dark fruits. This leaves a difficult-to-describe combination of wood extracts dried herb flavors and rancio. There is certainly more here to discover and I think the play off of standard Amrut flavors is successful. Definitely a whisky to ponder. I recommend a few drops of water.
18,Amrut Fusion - ‘Fusion’ is a word that is thrown around far too much in modern cuisine. In my opinion the act of combining elements from two different cultures should only be called ‘Fusion’ if it successfully integrates the elements of those cultures to form a truly new thing distinct from the source material. Amrut’s most awarded bottling to date does this brilliantly. A vatting of Indian malted barley and imported peated Scottish malt distilled separately and married in ex-bourbon barrels in Bangalore yields a bright citrusy malt with many dimensions – very much greater than the sum of its parts.Nose Light and lemony with elements of a Lowlander. Some green apple green banana and green papaya. Mossy with green honeysuckle. After a rest in the glass the Amrut banana starts to come through.Palate Silky texture but not heavily bodied. Bright acidic notes up front – apple lemon club soda with some light smoke. After a marginal tongue burn (for 50% ABV it’s not too dry) deeper flavors of smoked almonds caramel and butterscotch banana trifle malty cereal grains and bakery sweets emerge. Finish Medium-long with some nice light brown sugar light oak and malt. Lingering wafts of smoke and more nuttiness. Not bitter at all. Very pleasant.Overall I was a bit put off by the banana in the nose – just this side of rancid which seems to be an Amrut hallmark – but on the tongue this dram blooms into a medium-complex whisky with no apparent flaws. A few tropical notes give it an exotic style which might appeal to those tired of Scotch standards. The peated barley adds dimension without ever overbalancing the malt – a very successful marriage of the two styles. The addition of water doesn’t have any effect that I can determine.I marked this as a “Must Try” because I believe that every whisky lover should try spirits that are outside of the usual boundaries of old-world whisky. I think Fusion is a perfect introduction to Indian malt and is (so far) the only Amrut that I can recommend without any reservations. Progressive bars should carry this and the standard 43% ABV Amrut so it shouldn’t be too hard to find a way to taste it.
19,Amrut Peated - Amrut (see my other Amrut reviews here) continues to epitomize (and revolutionize) the category of world whisky. In fact within only a few more years they will warrant a category (Indian Whisky) all to themselves. A prolific library of single-malt releases a reputation for experimentation and collaboration and a very active promotion/marketing department are just some of the reasons that Amrut is becoming (or has become) a powerhouse in the industry.All that said I have to sheepishly admit what my long-time readers already know. I don’t like banana flavors and Amrut is particularly heavy on them. For that reason take my Amrut reviews with a grain of salt. Better yet go out then and try some yourself. (Don’t miss Fusion though arguably the best in their lineup).Here are my notes for the baseline peated expression (peated around 24 ppm) “Amrut Peated”. The peated malt is flown in from Scotland (supposedly from Islay?) and distilled and aged in Bangalore India. The company also bottles a cask-strength version.Nose Very peaty with an earthy clay-like scent. Not sweet more umami – seaweed and soy. Deeper in there is a suggestion of kiwi the everpresent Amrut banana and black tea. A dash of water only draws out a note of cigarette smoke.Hint Let it breathe a little initially there is a bit of a rotten banana peel smell that dissipates after a few minutes undisturbed in the glass.Palate Very nice full body a blast of intense peat and quite a lot of tongue burn almost grain-like in its roughness. This fades quickly leaving greenwood smoke seaweed tobacco and more earthy clay. The water brings some acidity to the experience but seems to thin the body. There is a nice additional lime flavor.Finish Expectedly long a bit of dark chocolate creeps in along with spent tea leaves cigar or cigarette ash and a little vegetal bitterness at the tail end.Overall Reminds me a bit of Finlaggan – where the youth of the malt means all of the complexity is in the peat which delivers a lot of intense flavor but not a lot of secondary notes. The alcohol burn is a bit rough – likely because of the quick maturation – but nevertheless this is a powerful peaty kick in the head that any true peat-head should take a look at. Preferably without paying the somewhat inflated price for a full bottle. I wouldn’t bother with the water unless it tastes a little sluggish to you.
20,Amrut Portonova - Amrut Portonova like the wildly popular Fusion is another homerun for Indian whisky producer Amrut. Like the Intermediate Sherry release Portonova is constructed using an involved process that Whisky Advocate editor John Hansell describes as a “port-pipe sandwich” The single-malt spends approximately 3 years in a combination of new and ex-bourbon barrels in the hot and humid Indian climate followed by a dunk for several months in imported Portugese port pipes. After picking up some port character (again this is a tropical climate so the process is accelerated) the whisky is transferred back into ex-bourbon barrels to marry before bottling at cask-strength. I’d personally be very curious to try two whiskies matured in this way one with and the other without the final boubon maturation to see if it has any real effect. At any rate the whole process takes somewhere between 3 and 4 years and the malt retails for almost $125.What?!Yes $125 for a 4 year-old malt whisky. I’d like to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about price again. It’s becoming more and more evident that the whisky industry’s pricing during boom times is based less on maintenance of profit-margins and more on flights of whimsy. You can argue all you want that port pipes are expensive to import that whisky evaporates faster in a hot climate that specialty bottlings are expensive to produce or that smaller/boutique producers don’t have the production capacity or efficiency to pump out cheap whisky by the truckload. If Amrut can make a 3 year-old single malt and sell it for $50 (which no doubt contains the same wild profit margin) they should be able to produce a four year-old cask-strength port-sandwich version with 33% higher ABV for $75 at the most.The conclusion is simple whisky producers (especially those with “hot” products in a burgeoning market) can charge whatever they think they can get for their whisky and the only defense those of us with budgets have is to carefully pick our malt purchases to maximize the price-vs-quality ratio of our collections. See my article about price-vs-quality for some strategies.All that said Portonova is an exquisite product which (in a blind tasting) could easily be confused with a $125+ 21 year-old wine-finished scotch. Last I saw it had sold out everywhere but if you have the budget a love of port/wine finishes and see some on a shelf somewhere just know that I thought it was fantastic.Only 150 cases were produced. I got the opportunity to taste Portonova which was labelled only as ‘Amrut Mystery’ in the #amrut5 twitter tasting late last year. Thanks to Colin for organizing the Amrut Twitter Tasting and sending me the samples!Color Deep dark mahogany. Richly colored.Nose Piercing nose – a sour top note like key limes over a layer of round plummy sweetness. Lots of port character – ruby berries plump black raisins resiny brandy. Underneath there is a hint of banana sorbet but distinctly different from other Amruts.Palate There’s the Amrut banana upfront. Sweet and just off cloying. There is moderate tongue burn followed by sweet-and-sour mix cinnamon raisin toast sticky prunes banana nut bread and raspberry jam. Viscous mouthfeel syrupy but not oily or thick.Finish Subtle but long. Leaves behind a sherry-like cherry syrup drying oak and some vague savoriness/meatiness. A bit muddled.Overall The nose is something unique. That sour high note combined with a sea of dark fruits and rich layers of port make an uncanny but delicious combination. I’m not sure where the sour lime note comes from – it’s not something I associate with port – but it carries through on the tongue. The finish is a little bit vague with most of the exciting flavors dried up and only the wood and some remnant plummy notes left. But the nose… I could sit and smell this all day.With Water The sour note I mentioned is amplified by the addition of water. It reveals notes of green banana sweet pea and toffee in the nose. On the tongue the whisky becomes sweeter and the burn is very much diminished. The finish also is somewhat clarified with more green fruits and some golden raisin. I definitely suggest trying this with a very small amount of water.
21,Amrut Single Malt - Whisky is primarily made in Scotland Ireland the United States Japan and Canada. However much like the fine wine industry enterprising distillers are cropping up in all corners of the globe with new artisan whisky products. Some like the Whisky in a Can from a company in the Caribbean don’t exactly qualify as ‘fine’. It should be noted also that whisky made in hot humid climates tends to mature very fast and age statements should be considered accordingly. A 4 year-old bourbon from Kentucky and a 4 year-old single malt from India might be equivalent in maturity to a 12 year-old Scotch or Irish whiskey. This is not to say that they are necessarily of equivalent quality many aficionados contend that slow maturation results in a smoother more nuanced and higher-quality spirit.I recently sampled my first-ever single malt from the country of India. Amrut Distillers in Bangalore India a veteran producer of various spirits and liquors has become something of a buzzword lately in the whisky world by releasing a series of single malts distilled and aged in India. See the Distillery box below for details. I sampled the entry-level “Amrut Single Malt” a no-age-statement unpeated single malt. It’s probably only several years old.Nose Big grain – cereals of several types. A fading hint of ex-bourbon casks vanilla and woodiness. Quite a lot of nose prickle. Once it settles in the glass there is a huge helping of banana trifle. Then there is more banana banana and banana. Seriously it’s all banana. A dash of water brings out some interesting dessert flavors – cinnamon baked apple crumble and cinnamon raisin toast.Palate After a hefty bit of burn there is a nice blend of tropical fruits – kiwi and green banana grilled peaches and barrel char.Finish Medium and a little bitter. Of course there’s banana and the bitterness seems to come from the oak and barrel char.Overall Betrays its age with the burn and its inexperience with the heavy banana notes. Nevertheless it’s an impressive dram for an upstart distillery in a challenging climate. I wouldn’t pay more than $30 for it though as I’m not partial to banana flavors in my malts. Adding a bit of water doesn’t hurt.
22,anCnoc (12 year) - I had the pleasure of participating in the 2/24/2011 #anCnoc Twitter tasting hosted by @EdinburghWhisky and anCnoc. This first sample of the entry-level 12 year expression was generally approved-of with tasters noting many fruits ranging from fresh spring berries to tropical fruits and flowers. The 12-year-old expression is aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Here are my notes from the event.(Twitter tasting – 50ml sample courtesy of anCnoc (Knockdhu distillery) – 2/24/2011 #anCnoc twitter tasting)Nose First whiff is of raspberries and cream. Lemon meringue. Definitely honeyed. Light and floral. Later I get a bit of peaches perhaps peach schnapps. A drop of water revives the nose and pulls out lots of green apple.Body Light and unfortunately watery. Upfront are bananas dipped in caramel sauce developing into dry haw or straw and finally some bitter notes not citrus but woody green sap or freshly-cut pine or birch logs. A dash of water may amp up the sweet honey character.Finish is initially sweet and caramel-heavy which fades into honey and those bitter green sap and oak notes which remain to the end of the medium length finish. Leaves me thinking about a bitter digestif – perhaps a hoppy aftertaste.
23,"anCnoc (16 year) - I had the pleasure of participating in the 2/24/2011 #anCnoc Twitter tasting hosted by @EdinburghWhisky and anCnoc. This second sample of the flagship 16-year was my least-favorite although it shows ample maturity and smoothness it doesn’t stand out among similar Speysides. The 16-year-old expression is aged in only second-fill bourbon casks.(Twitter tasting – 50ml sample courtesy of anCnoc (Knockdhu distillery) – 2/24/2011 #anCnoc twitter tasting)Nose The 16 is more subdued than the 12 year – fruits are cooked or jammed. Toffee and vanilla more in the front. Grassy. Hazelnut or praline ice cream? Water makes nose too subdued.Body There is an unctuous thick mouthfeel. Creamy and silky. Feels much older than it is. Water thins out the body too much.Palate Big on the hazelnuts. Light-roast coffee. Sweetened cream. Some cooked fruits in the background cherry cordial. Other tasters found black pepper/tea/tobacco. Water brings out the sweet bourbon-oak character perhaps a little too much.Finish is big on the vanilla and drying oak and is quite long leaving lingering black pepper behind.Very nice after-dinner. Desserty but robust. Not too sweet or cloying. Complex and with interesting spice and off-fruit notes. Not a great deal of depth but contemplative.

24,"anCnoc (1996 vintage, bottled 2011) - I had the pleasure of participating in the 2/24/2011 #anCnoc Twitter tasting hosted by @EdinburghWhisky and anCnoc. This third-and-last sample of the brand-new 1996 vintage (which will be released to select European markets) was my favorite showing a super-chewy body mounds of savory notes (which I love) salted nuts and meats. Most of the Twitter tasters also listed this as their favorite. The limited-edition 1996 vintage (bottled in 2011) is matured on-site at the Knockdhu distillery and bottled without chill-filtering at between 14 and 14.5 years old (in January 2011). It was matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks.(Twitter tasting – 50ml sample courtesy of anCnoc (Knockdhu distillery) – 2/24/2011 #anCnoc twitter tasting)Nose Unexpected. Shoe leather and paint thinner. Let it sit for a few minutes to dissipate. Now there’s salted nuts a whiff of meats smoking on the barbecue nothing sweet going on here. Duck confit and white beans (Thank to @maltjerry for the cassoulet tasting note). A dash of water doesn’t improve it – perhaps just reveals some of the original malt sugars.Body The mouthfeel is a revelation. Thick and syrupy but not remotely sweet. Chewy. Don’t add water to this the body is too interesting.Palate Starts with malt burn goes straight for the creamy peanut butter then lingers in the area of smoked meats hummus shortbread with stewed plums Old unfinished wood. Rice pudding. salted nuts. nougat!Finish Long and evolving going from those peanuts to salted fish copper pennies browned steak carmelized onions. The peanut-butter lingers for long after. Fantastic.Wow. It’s a shame there is such a limited quantity of this liquid. If you can find it buy some!
"
25,Angel’s Envy Bourbon - When sampling lower-priced bourbons I generally run into what I call the “shudder factor”. Some kind of instinctive natural aversion to the taste of impure alcohol makes me shudder and emit a noise like “blechh” or “eughhh”… of course the same thing happens when sampling the bottom-shelf Scotch blends so don’t think I’m being un-American here. Additionally the sticky-sweet taste of corn whiskey reminds me generally of the high-fructose corn syrup found in among other things cheap pancake syrup or… you know… rubber.Angel’s Envy is a Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey that is aged for an estimated 4-7 years and then finished for an additional 3-6 months in “port pipes” – casks that previously held fortified wine from Portugal. Whatever distiller Lincoln Henderson is doing it works. There was no shudder factor here. This stuff may be young but it is truly a quality dram. This is the kind of whiskey that raises eyebrows and finally gives me a bourbon to recommend in the sub-$50 range. I was beginning to think such a thing didn’t exist!Nose Mainly a standard bourbon nose with some marzipan black cherry syrup kettle corn sugar cookie and a hint of blackberry jam in the background.Palate Medium-heavy body with a significant amount of burn on the tongue. After the burn clears the sweet corn and dark berries come to the fore along with a distinct oakiness. Once the burn subsides this is sweet and delicious and not at all cloying industrial or shudder-inducing.Finish There’s the port. Nice and long with eddies of ruby port fresh berries oak tannins and a touch of bitter charred wood.Overall A very conservative take on a port finish. The port is very much in the background letting the clean bourbon flavors take center stage. Still it’s nice to see experimentation and successful application of aging and flavoring techniques applied to American whiskey. Maybe some day I’ll get to try a sherry finished bourbon! This one is a pleasant easy-to-drink experience and the price is quite reasonable.
26,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2014) - A big thanks to Aaron at Ro-Bro who kindly sent me a review sample of the new cask-strength bourbon from Angel’s Envy. First off this is not your usual cask-strength release of a flagship product where they simply leave out the water. This limited release (6500 bottles) comes from cherry-picked barrels aged up to 7 years and thus functions like the “Limited Edition Small Batch” from Four Roses. As with the regular Angel’s Envy this bourbon is finished in port casks. The price a whopping $169 suggested retail shows just how far controversial upstart Angel’s Envy has come since its first release in 2010 and also how crazily inflated the whisky market has become. If you had told anyone in the liquor business four years ago that an under-seven-year-old bourbon would sell (and certainly sell out) for $169 a bottle they’d have laughed at you.Nose Hot (strong alcohol fumes). Ruby port grapefruit honeycomb and a deep round woodiness. Under the blanket of alcohol there’s roasted chestnuts cherry cordial and charcoal. There actually isn’t as much fruit on the nose as I expected. After a few minutes of rest in the glass it develops an awesome heady vanilla buttercream frosting aroma. Really – wow.Palate Moderate tongue-burn. Barrel tannins are immediately apparent and then blackberry jam butterscotch and cherry ice cream.Finish Long and warming. A nice tart wave of mixed berries fades into spun sugar which becomes burnt caramel and then charcoal. Never bitter.With Water A few drops of water increase the vanilla frosting note in the aroma and might be making the flavor and finish nuttier. A more aggressive watering (to around 40% ABV) yields unripe berries and kiwi on the nose. Seriously kiwi. However this makes it slightly anemic (at least in comparison to full strength) on the tongue. I’d shoot for around 50% ABV if you want to tame the fire.Overall I definitely suggest letting this open up in the glass for a few minutes – you want that initial nuclear mushroom-cloud of alcohol to dissipate and that head of vanilla frosting to develop before nosing. As with other Angel’s Envy releases you can count on the bourbon component to complement (not overwhelm) the port finish. However the high proof of this release amps both up so that intense berry/fruit flavors compete with concentrated oak and corn syrup flavors. While the flagship Angel’s Envy pairs easy-sipping soft subtle bourbon with port wood at cask strength the mixture is much denser and loses some of that subtlety. You’re best off tasting this at full proof (after the rest) and then watering it down to around 50% to get the best of both worlds. I think it’s an excellent whisky and really shows what Angel’s Envy is capable of. I can’t love the price point however no matter how carefully hand-picked the casks are.
27,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2015) - A big thanks to Aaron at Ro-Bro who kindly sent me a review sample of the 2015 limited release (7500 bottles) of cask-strength bourbon from Angel’s Envy. (See my review of last year’s release here).I have a lot of respect for Angel’s Envy. They take sourced bourbon of between 4 and 7 years of age (like so many other companies) – blended from two or more different Kentucky distilleries making Straight Bourbon – and make it magical with expert cask selection and finishing in port (or rum for the rye) casks. In fact their standard port-finished bourbon is one of my cabinet regulars.Their new distillery is already producing spirit which means in 2020 we might start seeing some bottled Angel’s Envy with their own juice (or earlier if it’s good enough to bottle at younger than 6 years).This batch of 7500 bottles represents a now-traditional annual limited release in the same vein as Four Roses Limited editions and the BTAC annual releases. In other words it’s super expensive and guaranteed to sell out quickly. This year’s batch is bottled at a whopping 63.95% ABV which is about 4% higher than last year’s.Nose Candy corn fresh juicy peaches dried apple slices. A little deeper in there’s creamed corn fresh hay and a deep heavy buttery oakiness. The sweet/sugary notes are minor mostly burnt caramel and a hint of maple sugar. After a rest in the glass the aroma is heavy with bright vivid fruit punch.Palate Hot. So very hot! Untempered that 64% ABV is some serious business. After the flames die down and your eyes stop watering there is sparkly ground cinnamon fresh snappy red apples cinnamon red-hots and a light non-cloying general sweetness like a light brown sugar glaze.Finish Medium-long. Slightly bitter oaky tannins only at first and then a few passing tart notes (red plums lemon peel) and a mouth-coating Red Delicious apple skin note that hangs on for quite awhile at the end.With Water A small splash of water brings out a little more sweetness on the nose (caramel/butterscotch) but at the cost of some of the intensity of the other notes. The palate is much more friendly with pleasant fruit notes co-mingling with light oak and toffee. The finish is unchanged. I highly recommend some water with this (if you have a whole bottle also try watering a small glass down to around 46% and see how different it is) unless you think you can handle the burn of a sip at cask strength which has the benefit of more intense flavors all around.Overall This is a damn tasty whiskey. What I’ve always liked about Angel’s Envy is its ability to transcend the bourbon clichés and deliver both subtlety and complexity in a way that other heavier bourbons just can’t. At cask strength you have an iron fist in a velvet glove – those same subtle complex elements are thrust in your face and burned onto your tongue for better or for worse. Priced at or above $160 it’s your decision whether that sounds enticing enough to justify that chunk of change. For me it’s a reserved “Must Try” (good luck!).
28,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2016) - A big thanks to Aaron at Ro-Bro who kindly sent me a review sample of the 2016 limited release (8000 bottles) of cask-strength bourbon from Angel’s Envy. (See my review of last year’s release here.)This has become an annual tradition for me. I get a package in the mail around the time the leaves start to turn – a precious 100ml bottle of the current year’s release of Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon. It’s always an intense burnished copper/gold color and it smells like the fires of Hell burning up a Portuguese wine-making town. At 62.3% ABV this year’s release is no different. A seven (ish) year-old Kentucky Bourbon (sourced from at least two – probably more – Kentucky distilleries) finished in ruby port casks the barrels chosen for the annual cask-strength release are carefully selected from maturing stock by Wes and Kyle Henderson.You can look forward to 2020 or so when we might start seeing whisky from Angel’s Envy distilled at their new distillery in Louisville Kentucky.The estimated retail price for this is $179 up 20 bucks from the 2015 release which shows just how insane the premium whisky category has become of late. The only people considering this purchase are already die-hard Angel’s Envy fans (and who don’t need my review) or those flush with more money than they know what to do with. If you’re in the latter category feel free to buy me a bottle too! 😉Nose Approach with caution. At this proof it will crawl right up your nose and burn your sinuses! Furniture lacquer blueberry jam espresso bright red candied apples black cherry lozenges and black pepper. Deep dark and pungent.Palate An initial wave of cassis is burned out by a gout of hellfire that anesthetizes the tongue (you’d think I’d be used to cask strength whiskies by now…) Under anesthesia the taste buds can make out blackberry preserves toffee espresso charcoal and a rough oaky sweetness.Finish Medium-short but confused. Upfront there is bitter charcoal and charred toast which fades quickly into tannic red grape skins. Quite dry.With Water A big splash of water helps quench the fires and allows me to detect a few additional notes marshmallow mixed berries and licorice on the palate. Water is nearly a necessity here to make it drinkable but you might brave a first sip or two without to get the full blast of concentrated 124 proof flavor.Overall As usual Angel’s Envy cask strength brings a wealth of intense flavor at a tongue-searing proof. You pay for the robust dense flavors of berries and complex caramelized sugars in dead taste buds and the inability to smell for a few hours after. By all means proof it down but you might as well experience the full force of the 124.6 proof that you paid for. And paid well I should add at around $180. For that kind of money this can only be a special-edition splurge.
29,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon (2017) - A big thanks to Marke for the review sample of the Angel’s Envy 2017 limited release (10000 bottles) of cask-strength bourbon. (See my review of last year’s release here.) Angel’s Envy seems to be trying to ramp up the availability of this “limited” release – there were 2000 more bottles produced than last year and the list of states in which they are being distributed is longer.That’s not the only change. If you were unconvinced that the “whisky bubble” is still going strong and getting more… uhh… bubble-ish? Look no further In 2015 Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon was $159 (already very high for a bourbon under ten years of age) in 2016 it was $179. This year $199. If you’re reading this and wondering if it’s worth 200 bucks I can tell you without tasting it first No. No bourbon under ten years of age is worth $200 in my opinion. For the following I will therefore be pretending that I am an oil tycoon and can afford to drink $200 whisky.As with every annual release of this since 2012 we’re talking about Kentucky bourbon not distilled by Angel’s Envy (their new distillery’s output won’t be ready for bottling until 2020-ish) that is approximately seven years old and finished in port wine casks from Portugal. The “cherry” (best) casks are picked by the Henderson family aged somewhat longer in the port casks and bottled at cask strength. Port pipes vary in size and liquid volume at bottling time will be reduced by the “angel’s share” so sheer guesswork says that the 2017 edition came from a batch of between 10 and 15 casks. This year’s bottling strength is almost the same as last year’s 62.25% ABV or 124.5 US Proof. The color is a darker mahogany than last year’s.I happen to have some of last year’s 100ml review sample left over so I will be doing a side-by-side comparison.Nose A gentle waft of juicy red grapes and berry jam greets the nose. The fruits are redder and fresher than the 2016 edition. Beneath the fruit is a layer of varnish and dark oak. The lacquer note from last year is muted and seems to convey a sweeter wood-sugar note. There is also more marzipan (almond extract) than usual. Neither glass emits much in the way of grain spices. A rest in the glass adds a welcome blanket of vanilla frosting. It’s worth letting this open up a little (20-30 minutes). Both vintages are powerful don’t get your nose too deep in the glass or you risk burning out your sense of smell for awhile.Palate On fire out of the gate A cascade of searing inferno washes over my tongue raping and pillaging before settling into a dull numb ache. The few surviving tastebuds register dense blackberry jam toffee espresso and oaky tannins before giving up the ghost. You may as well give this a taste at full strength to prove your bravado. Then give your mouth an hour or two to recover and water the rest down sufficiently to taste. The 2016 edition had more chewy dried fruits and taffy notes as well as more caramelized sugars.Finish Long. Residual fresh red fruits (fruit punch) and cinnamon-spiced mulled wine linger for awhile fading with peppery mouth-drying tannins and blackberry seeds (you know the ones stuck in your teeth after a few blackberries which taste woody when you find them). The 2016 edition was more incoherent and shorter.With Water At last! A healthy splash (or two) of water temporarily mutes the fresh fruit aroma but also sweetens both the nose and palate. The bourbon’s complexity and woody sweetness are more apparent when you can actually taste them. This is one cask-strength bourbon that I like even better at a drinking strength (50% ish ABV). You’ll need a lot of water to truly take away the fire. Note that if your personal ethics rebel at the idea of adding water to expensive cask-strength whisky taking a big glug of water immediately before and immediately after each taste of whiskey can help.Overall First is it better than the 2016 edition which I recommended? Yes I think so. It lacks a little of that caramelized depth that is reserved for older and more-concentrated bourbons but more than makes up for it with polish coherency and intensely fresh-tasting fruit notes. For that reason this whisky’s 2017 edition is still recommended but only if the $200 price tag (and second $20 increase in two years) doesn’t faze you. It certainly fazes me I wouldn’t have purchased a bottle at $179 and I will continue to not purchase a bottle at $199. All that said there is no denying that this is an exceptional bourbon from exceptionally well-chosen barrels and adeptly finished.
30,Angel’s Envy Rye - A big thanks to Aaron at Deep Focus who kindly sent me a review sample of the new rye from Angel’s Envy. The brainchild of Master Distiller Lincoln Henderson Angel’s Envy rocked the American whisky scene awhile back with its modern take on bourbon. Now their second release a 95% rye whiskey finished in Caribbean rum casks briefly hit the shelves before promptly selling out everywhere (near me anyway). This despite its frankly usurious price point of $70 – $80.The rye almost certainly hails from Midwest Grain Products (formerly LDI) where a lot of independently-bottled ryes are made these days. The mashbill is 95% rye and 5% malted barley. The rye is aged for six years in new American oak barrels and then transferred for 18 months to some hand-selected Caribbean rum casks. Sourcing the rum casks appears to have been quite an ordeal with Lincoln Henderson quoted as saying that 100 different rums were sampled before making the choice. The result was bottled in the iconic Italian glass “angel wing” bottles at 50% ABV an upgrade in bottling proof from the company’s port-finished bourbon.Nose Spicy! Assorted baking spices (clove cinnamon etc.) with a deep undercurrent of molasses. The rum character is evident with fresh cane juice coconut and a very heavy caramelized sugar note. Something vegetal as well – root beer? Sweetness and spice alternate for dominance in the nose. Very robust.Palate Mulled cider black pepper caramels. Molasses again – here the rum is even more clear. Tastes almost like blackstrap rum. At 50% ABV the burn is present but the sweetness compensates nicely. A lot of flavor here.Finish Quite long. Crystallized ginger cloves and burnt sugar on the fade-out. The burnt sugar note gets a little too acrid for me but another sip takes care of that. 🙂With Water A few drops of water release a wave of black licorice and cake frosting. The same appear on the palate. This definitely benefits from just a little bit of water.Overall This is a spice bomb and no joke. All of the usual rye character is present in spades with a healthy layer of caramelized sugary rum. The interplay is as natural as spices in cider or brown sugar in spice cake. The bottling proof was a good choice as everything (flavor aroma) is amped up equally and without numbing my tongue. For seven-and-a-half years old this comes off as big and flavorful and slightly older than it is. I would have awarded a “Must Try” if the whiskey were either cheaper or more available. I can’t love the price or the shortages but I can love this sample for as long as it lasts…
31,Ardbeg (10 year) - In a travesty of blogger failure I’ve managed to write a whisky blog for SIX YEARS without reviewing Ardbeg 10 year-old. I now right this egregious wrong with the following review. I beg your collective forgiveness.Ardbeg that bastion of peat-freakdom that Mecca of peat-worship is one of the few distilleries that can print the phrase “not only the BEST of the Islay malt whiskies but THE BEST WHISKY IN THE WORLD” on its label and not be ashamed of the pretension and hyperbole. Of course there is no such thing. The “best whisky in the world” is a concept that only Jim Murray believes in because it sells him a lot of books. Still Ardbeg is a solid contender for membership in the pantheon of best distilleries in the world and many whisky aficionados would place it high on their personal lists. Many fellow noobs have cut their peat-teeth on this smoky monster and it has ruined many of the same for other peated drams.For more feel free to peruse my other Ardbeg reviews including one of my all-time favorites whiskies Corryvreckan.Ardbeg 10 is a relatively simple dram. It is Ardbeg single malt using heavily-peated malt (55 to 65 ppm) from the maltings at Port Ellen (Ardbeg’s own kiln-fired maltings closed in 1977) and aged for at least 10 years in ex-bourbon barrels. The whisky is batched and bottled without chill filtration at 46% ABV. I’d like to point out that unlike many other whiskies *cough*Macallan*cough* Ardbeg 10 has risen in price only $5 to $10 in the last six years and is still just as good. That’s impressive.Thanks especially to Laura from The Baddish Group who both reminded me that I have not reviewed this stalwart dram and kindly sent me some. Thanks Laura!Color Pale strawNose Pungent. A hint of lemon precedes a torrent of smoky peat. The peat is redolent of campfires with toasted wood charcoal woodsmoke and smouldering dry grass. Beneath the peat is a subtle layer of vanilla and brine.Palate Full-bodied. A tinge of sweetness greats the tongue of pure malted grains and oaky vanilla. This is quickly obliterated by smoking hay dry seagrass slightly bitter charcoal and dense woodsy peat. While the flavors are intense they are also very well-balanced and the tongue burn is minimal considering its robust 46% ABV. One could contemplate this smoky complexity for hours.Finish Very long (I will be tasting Ardbeg on my lips and tongue throughout the evening). A swath of bitterness is balanced well by a resurgence of malty nutty grains and a strong spike of anise and black pepper. This all fades together leaving a fugue of grassy boggy peat and smoke.With Water A few drops of water initially mute the nose so give the glass a few swirls and a rest before nosing again. The water seems to unbalance the alcohol burn and peat component making the aroma sharper and more one-dimensional although I get some buttery oak now. The palate is tamer and sweeter but the balance still seems off. At 46% this does not need water. I recommend keeping it neat.Overall I’m often struck by the differences between Ardbeg peat and Laphroaig peat. The former is all about smoke and the impression is of a distant wildfire pervading everything. The latter is all about the sea with brine and seaweed and iodine. I can’t say which I prefer – I’m alternatively in the mood for either – and I can’t say that either is objectively better. Still the essence of Ardbeg is control over chaos – an impressive feat considering the wild force of nature that peat becomes in the glass. Ardbeg is both masterfully constrained and wildly flavorful the kind of whisky that makes you realize why people like smoky flavors in scotch and also reminds you that the Scots have been perfecting this style for hundreds of years. If you haven’t had Ardbeg 10 there’s really no point in reading about it. You must experience it to complete your training young padawan. If you aren’t sure you like peat though consider just buying a glass neat first. If you find you like peat you cannot go wrong by owning a bottle.
32,Ardbeg Airigh Nam Beist - As far as the Ardbeg special releases go this impossible-to-pronounce beauty (sometimes referred to as ‘The Beast’) is pretty much gone. There may be a few dusty bottles left on shelves but as the world has moved on to whirlpools and alligators this post betrays that I am once again late to the party. I found this one on offer at a bar outside of Boston MA for some exorbitant price. Knowing that it’s soon to be a relic I sprung for a glass.One thing I love about Ardbeg – although peatier than a mouthful of Scottish fen the special releases often show a dizzying range of eccentric flavors. While I’m not a huge fan of the standard 10 year (I think it’s overpriced and not as good as Lagavulin 16 or Laphroaig QC) the special releases almost always blow me away and The Beast is no exception. It’s around 16 years of age and named for one of the lochs above the distillery and means ‘Valley of the Beast’ in Gaelic.Nose Starts with a typical peated nose. This evolves quickly into nuanced citrus and spice notes laden with blood orange peel coriander salty morels in a wine reduction and delicate oak. Water sweetens but very much dulls the nose while coaxing out a little caramel with smoked salt.Palate A torrent of smoke and peat. Meaty and salty. Charred pork on the barbecue. Smouldering wood chips. The char grows in the mouth turning from charcoal and tar to muddy moss and burning underbrush and finally to sweet roasted peaches and toasted pine nuts. A few drops of water brings out a fudgy brownie note at the expense of some of the intensity of that peat blast.Finish Predictably long (you’ll be scrubbing it out of your teeth in the morning) with some surprising dark chocolate nibs freshly roasted coffee beans and a fading marshmellowy malted milk which coats the walls of the mouth. The finish is totally foreign to the palate notes and is the best part. As the last notes fade there is a little wintergreen and of all things sour apple.Overall Like Willy Wonka’s Three-Course-Dinner Gum you get a salty nutty appetizer a main course of roasted barbecue pork a dessert of roasted peaches a cup of chocolatey coffee and an after-dinner mint! Amazing. As you’re unlikely to find a bottle outside of auctions I suggest keeping an eye out for a lonely bottle at a bar or a sample to bum off a friend. It’s an experience.Don’t bother with the drops of water tackle this one in its full undiluted glory first.
33,Ardbeg Alligator (Committee Release) - Another big thanks to Tim who slipped me a sample of the Ardbeg Alligator (the Ardbeg Committee release) a few weeks ago. Now that everyone’s talking about the public release of Alligator this week I thought I’d post my tasting notes. I don’t believe there’s any difference inside the bottle between the Committee release and the public one.The name of this limited edition is a play on the term used to describe the heaviest possible charring on the inside of barrels used for whisk(e)y maturation. When the inside wood of the barrel is blackened to this point it begins to look like the scaly skin of an alligator. Ardbeg’s Alligator is a no-age-statement experimental malt bottled at 51.2% ABV after a full 10 year maturation in new American oak barrels that had received the alligator char treatment. This ‘alligator’ malt was then vatted with an undisclosed quantity of the standard 10 year and married for an additional year. That makes it approximately 11 years old.Nose Full-on Ardbeg peat with overtones of charcoal briquette dry hay a bit of sweetness like barbecue sauce. There’s also vanilla in spades after a rest in the glass.Palate Fiery with big wood notes of smoking chips cinnamon bark charred glaze on barbeque pork. A little bourbony. The higher ABV shines forth upping the ante both in mouth-burn and flavor concentration.Finish Long with lots of earthy peat and dry moss. The dryness of the peat alternates with the sweetness of the wood for control. A hint of bitterness (wet charcoal) at the tail end. Just when I think it’s over there’s an intriguing chocolate-mint note.Overall An interesting take on the Ardbeg profile with a lot more sweet woodiness and big roasted barrel flavors. Reminds me a bit of the Laphroaig Quarter-Cask but with a bigger bite and a more round robust Ardbeg peat. I’m not sure the difference is big enough to warrant owning this over the standard 10 year especially at a whopping $120. It does taste like an “ultimate” bourbon-finished Islay if that’s your thing with the peat taking second billing to the cask. I guess that means the “experiment” of alligator-charring the barrels was a success although the final product is not nuanced or impressive enough for me to recommend paying the above-average price. Although this is quite good whisky and innovation in Scotch is always to be applauded it just didn’t move me to buy a bottle. Given the sellout run on these bottles I guess that puts me in the minority.Water While leaving the nose unchanged a few dashes of water amplify the peat on the tongue bringing a bright acidity and sour cherry notes. Reveals more bitterness in the finish. It’s worth experimenting with the water but don’t dilute a whole glass.
34,Ardbeg An Oa - The first addition to the core range of Ardbeg in some significant amount of time that I can’t be bothered to look up An Oa! Despite the fact that you might sound like you’re mid-stroke trying to pronounce it the whisky is named after a promontory or “mull” called Oa that protects Ardbeg’s oceanfront distillery from the worst of the Atlantic Ocean weather. There’s something on the box about the mull being “round” and the whisky being “round” too… Wow. They’re truly running out of stuff the put on these labels aren’t they?A no-age-statement (shock! awe!) vatting of various casks of Ardbeg including new (virgin) charred oak Pedro Ximénez (PX) sherry and first-fill bourbon. These are all dumped into a French oak “Gathering Vat” in the new “Gathering Room” at Ardbeg. Note that most other distilleries call this a “marrying vat” or “marrying tun” but we’ll let them have their cutsey name. The result is bottled at the randomly-chosen 46.6% ABV without chill filtration.While drinking this I try really (really) hard not to picture the dump tray at my local bar where all the “various” drink spillovers “marry” in the stainless-steel trap under the bar mat. And now so will you.Nose Unmistakably Ardbeg. Sooty smoke and malty grain sweetness in perfect balance. Vanilla charcoal and a very faint jam note that I’m probably forcing myself to detect because of the “PX Sherry” on the label. There is also an overt woodiness that is more obvious after your senses adjust to the smoke. Palate Sooty (did I already say that?) with a moderate tongue burn. Campfire (oak) smoke brown sugar root beer and fresh hay. Actually somewhat narrow despite Ardbeg’s usual complexity.Finish Very long. Smoke dominates the finish billowing and unrelenting. No seaweed or anything here just woodsmoke and an undercurrent of cereal sugars. No sherry that I can detect even with the power of suggestion.With Water Water has no apparent effect on the whisky. You might consider adding a little if it’s too hot for your liking but know that it will not dilute the smokiness at all.Overall Unfortunately without a vertical of Ardbeg in front of me I can’t make a confident assessment but I think this is much smokier than your typical Ardbeg 10 but with a little bit less dimension. All the talk about “gathering vats” and PX sherry and French oak is a little overstated I think when the peat smoke dominates and outweighs everything else. Could there be a little sandalwood from the French oak or “aniseed dates and hints of peach” from the PX sherry? Who knows I can’t smell or taste any of that. FFS the official tasting notes include “grilled artichokes”. You can’t make this stuff up.At the end of the day you’re talking about paying $60 for NAS Ardbeg that is not obviously better than Ardbeg 10 at $45 (here YMMV) and is demonstrably worse than Ardbeg Corryvreckan at $70. I think the answer is obvious. Go for one of those instead unless you have a chance to try it beforehand it and it floats your boat. My boat is firmly at anchor and this metaphor is getting away from me so I’m just going to stop typing now.
35,Ardbeg Corryvreckan - Sku at Sku’s Recent Eats kindly sent me a sample of Ardbeg Corryvreckan to advance my Islay education. 🙂 When I first nosed this dram I was bowled over by the rich vibrant and sour tropical fruit flavors tumbling out of the glass. These “Juicy Fruit” notes meld perfectly with the mild peat smoke notes to create an elegant and mouthwatering aroma. I was shocked – shocked I tell you – to discover that this dram is bottled at a whopping 57.1% ABV. While not quite as powerful as some higher cask strength whiskies this one is incredibly smooth and has very little mouth burn. I had to check several sources online before believing that it was anywhere north of 46% ABV.Nose Medicinal seaweedy peat but not the crushing “Burning blanket” notes I’d expect from Ardbeg. A floral background (unexpected) but difficult to pick out plus a sharp sour grapefruit or blood orange right in the front of the nose. Intriguing as there’s definitely more layers to this that I’m not picking out. A few drops of water make no discernible impact on the aroma.Palate Sour fruit pineapple! Surprising burst of fruity upfront like Juicy Fruit gum. Resolves into delicious well-rounded smoke without too much tar or woodiness. Those sour fruit elements continue right into the finish resonating with blood orange lime maybe some fresh juicy berries. Mild sweetness and always an overtone of bright citrusy peat. With a few drops of water the sweetness is more pronounced producing a sweetened fruit juice cocktail element. In my opinion this draws the sweetness of the whisky out of balance with the peat – I prefer it neat.Finish Long and smoky leaving you with a bit of tobacco smoke and toasted spices – clove and cinnamon – and a little bitter citrus peel.Corryvreckan is named after “the largest whirlpool in Europe” which is off the north coast of Islay. There is a lot of associated marketing mumbo-jumbo to go along with this all of which can safely be ignored. This is a very good dram despite not having a declared age statement and well worth the money. At $80-$90 a bottle it’s a little out of my usual price range but I will definitely be picking up a bottle of this for a special occasion!
36,Ardbeg Dark Cove - Ardbeg’s latest annual Limited Edition release Dark Cove is being marketed as the “darkest Ardbeg yet”. I’m not sure if that’s supposed to mean visually or spiritually but let’s just get this out of the way now it looks like regular old whisky. This NAS (no-age-statement) bottling combines Ardbeg from ex-bourbon casks with a “heart” of Ardbeg finished in “dark sherry” casks. No details on how they’re defining “dark sherry” (or “heart” for that matter) but the Internet has decided this means heavily-seasoned sherry casks. The result is bottled without chill-filtration at 46.5% ABV. Expect it on shelves around May 28th if the limited allocations don’t all sell out in preorder. Such is the nature of the whisky market today.Like a lot of excellent peated single malts Ardbeg Dark Cove fills the room with a heady scent of smoke and soft grains that evoke a plush cigar lounge or the elbow-polished wooden bar at a storied watering-hole. The liquid itself has the depth and complexity of aroma that one expects from Ardbeg. Still at $125 or more at retail and no age statement we must expect more from this Ardbeg. Does it measure up?Thanks to Laura at the Baddish Group for the review sample!Nose Potent. Fresh-cut cigars boggy campfire roasted cocoa nibs and soft malty grains. A rest in the glass reveals some uncharacteristic pear notes. If I really concentrate I can identify some of the citrus (lime peel?) notes that are so redolent in Corryvreckan. I smell nothing that suggests sherry let alone “dark sherry” – whatever that is.Palate Somewhat syrupy body. A flood of chocolate arrives on the tongue followed by a torrent of hot (young) alcohol. The floodwaters quickly recede leaving cayenne-spiked Mexican hot chocolate black pepper smoked paprika and smoldering oak firewood.Finish Long. A little peppery with dusty cocoa powder ashy woodsmoke and tobacco. My lips actually feel and taste like I’ve just finished a short cigar.With Water A few drops of water have little apparent effect on the aroma. They do bring out a little tartness on the palate though without diminishing it. I’d say water is optional here.Overall An odd duck. The nose is pretty much standard Ardbeg – perhaps even a little muted – almost a disappointment. But then it washes the tongue with the strongest chocolate note I’ve experienced in a whisky. The peat comes across as smoked pepper and smoky spices (paprika) which combine to create an unmistakable flavor of spicy Mexican hot chocolate. The bottling strength is appropriate but I do wish they’d used a larger percentage of older Ardbeg to subdue some of that fiery youth on the tongue. I also wish they’d used much more of the sherry-finished liquid as the balance could use a little punch of dried fruit.As much as we rely on Ardbeg to show what’s good about NAS (like my vote for NAS poster child Corryvreckan) I feel that they went a little too far here in the use of young whisky and held back on the older stuff. At $125 a bottle I’d expect some more hallmarks of old whisky OR some deeper sherry flavor. Despite those faults it’s an excellent whisky and far better than the standard 10-year Ardbeg. At $125 a bottle though I’d personally rather drink Corryvreckan for 2/3 the price.
37,Ardbeg Galileo - Ardbeg certainly loves their special releases. I have always enjoyed the Corryvreckan (which is actually a regular in the lineup not a one-off release) and I thought Alligator was intriguing. I’m starting to wonder though if these bottlings might be more marketing stunt than cutting-edge whiskymaking. I mean a rocket? C’mon. And just look at the silliness on the Galileo webpage. Do they mention the whisky? What’s in it? No. But you can upload a picture of yourself with a spacesuit helmet on! Anyway. Continuing with the theme of their one-distillery space race Ardbeg has released a ~12 year-old vatting of ex-bourbon Ardbeg and (cool!) Sicillian marsala wine cask-aged whisky at a bold 49% ABV. I am actually a big fan of marsala so I was hoping those nutty oxidized-wine notes would translate.Nose Lot of vanilla. Light brown sugar. Cereal. Very mild peat – this is Ardbeg?Palate Sharp piquant peat. Vanilla & caramel. Hefty burn. Some wooksmoke (fruit wood – like applewood chips smoking). A little lime juice on the tail end.Finish Not too bitter. Peat shows through (finally) on finish.With Water Becomes very perfumey like a room full of vanilla beans drying.Overall Lots of vanilla. Easy drinking for an Ardbeg but not much else to recommend it. I was 100% unable to identify the marsala. This is a particularly sweet aromatic whisky with a very muted peat profile. If someone handed me a glass I can honestly say I would enjoy drinking it. Alas the total mistranslation of the marsala cask (I would have said this was 100% ex-bourbon) and the special-edition hoopla seriously undermined the experience for me. I would say this whisky is not worth the (exceptional) effort required to secure a bottle. (Although K&L still has some in stock for $95 while it lasts.) My low rating shouldn’t be taken as a denouncement of the flavor or quality of this whisky – but as a statement on the value for the money. A self-conscious $50 pricetag would have warranted a Recommended score.
38,Ardbeg Uigeadail - So… for awhile everyone I talked to seemed to love the unpronounceable NAS Ardbeg which launched back before both NAS and unpronounceable names were common in the industry. When I began discovering malts Uigeadail was often spoken of in the same hushed tones as the original Supernova (which is coming back by the way). I have a confession to make. As much as I love the peaty power of Ardbeg and as much as I respect its parent company LVMH Uigeadail and I have never seen eye-to-eye. After three or four negative notes from tasting events in my book (none of them long enough for a blog post) I decided to jump on a sale at K&L and get a full bottle. Surely if everyone else loves this stuff I should be able to figure out what’s so good about it. My bottle has a batch code of L13 245 1518 6ML – so it was bottled on day 245 of 2013 or September 2nd.Uigeadail (pronounced believe it or not “Oo-geh-doll”) is named after the loch from which Ardbeg sources its water. The whisky is a vatting of standard Ardbeg from ex-bourbon casks (supposedly the 10-year) with some quantity of sherry-aged Ardbeg. The result is bottled at cask strength. Originally Uigeadail was conceived of to find a home for some old (1970s) sherry casks of Ardbeg left in the warehouse when new owners LVMH rehabbed the distillery after purchasing it from Hiram Walker. By vatting the long-in-the-tooth sherry casks (which would have lost a lot of peat character and become somewhat overly woody) with bright smoky 10 year-old Ardbeg from bourbon casks the whisky would become a peaty powerhouse with lots of resiny old-oak goodness. It worked and Uigeadail was a big success. Until recently when they must have run out of vintage sherried Ardbeg and switched to much younger sherry-aged whisky probably put down after the distillery reopened in 1998 or as late as 2003 when Uigeadail was first released. Internet gossip maintains that the whisky has decreased markedly in quality since those first editions. (Thanks for the info Jordan!) It should be noted that the price has also decreased.Update 12/17/2016 I’ve had a chance to sample a newer batch of Uigeadail (apologies – I don’t have the batch number). This time I find an aroma replete with smoke but devoid of fruit and a palate richly-flavored and peppery. The finish shows ripe red fruits at last. This batch is much better than the one I last reviewed although I still don’t see a reason to buy this over Ardbeg 10 (cheaper) or Corryvreckan (better).Nose Ardbeg woodsmoke with a smattering of sherry influence raisin fig etc. The effect while wholly integrated is two-dimensional. There is little to the peat character besides woodsmoke and little to the sherry character beyond raisin. Deep as I dig (and get a snoot-full of alcohol fumes for my trouble) I can’t find anything else.Palate Mildly creamy body and an expected amount of tongue-burn. A slight citrus note but not as obvious as Corryvreckan.Finish Long. Sherry-tinged woodsmoke fading without bitterness.With Water A few drops of water highlight some of the citrus notes in the nose and somewhat tame the tongue burn. The water also adds a welcome orange-peel character to the finish. Diluting down to 46% yields an easily drinkable dram with some sweet citrus but very tame peat. I suggest experimenting with water to find the right sweet spot for your tastes.Overall Alas I’m not a fan. Despite several tastings from my bottle over several weeks (and a few over the last couple of years) I do not see anything redeeming about this malt. For my tastes Ardbeg 10 delivers all the peaty complexity you could want for less money. For more money Corryvreckan is better in every way and is very much worth the extra price. That’s not something I say every day.
39,Arran Machrie Moor - See my review of Isle of Arran distillery’s 10-year product here. In 2004 Arran released a limited-edition bottling of a peated version of their Arran malt with only 9000 bottles shipped. In 2011 they released a second edition with 12000 bottles worldwide. They must have sold out quickly because any mention of the peated malt has vanished from Arran’s website. Weird.The bottle I tasted was likely the 2nd edition although that also appears mostly sold out at online retailers. If you really want a bottle after reading my review you may have trouble finding it. 😉Peated to a relatively mild 14 ppm (phenol parts per million the industry standard metric for peat content) using local Arran peat and named after Machrie Moor a tourist destination on the island boasting Bronze Age stone circles the malt is reportedly 7 or 8 years of age. I’m always a little skeptical when a traditionally non-peated whisky releases a peated version. Peat unlike bacon does not make everything better.Nose Interesting peat. Campfire burlap hay. Slight meatiness. Light – smoked but not muddied. Not hugely complex. Arran peat does not appear to have a distinctive nose unlike Ornkey and Islay peat. It just smells like regular old smoke.Palate Creamy. Fiery – the youth is evident unfortunately so. Peat only expresses itself as a low smolder. Some brown sugar.Finish Medium-long. The peat makes itself known – a nice dash of smoked almonds. There’s good balance between peat smoke and cereal sweetness – at least they didn’t try to peat the hell out of it.With Water Water adds some grassiness but not much else.Overall This dram has the air of an experiment – someone at Arran said “hey let’s do peat!” and so they did. It’s moderately well-balanced but it’s neither particularly complex nor particularly exciting. It’s also been bottled far too young. Arran die-hard fans would be interested to see what smoking does to their favorite malt but the rest of us shouldn’t offer more than a shrug.
40,Auchentoshan “The Bartender’s Malt” - I was about to start this review by saying that I have a “love/hate” relationship with Auchentoshan… but then I realized that would be incorrect. It’s more of a “like/frequently-forget-about” relationship. I recall being blown away by the effect of heavy sherry on this otherwise shy Lowland malt but I also recall being thoroughly whelmed (Get it? Neither over- nor under-whelmed…) by just about every other release. The name is fun to say though so they’ve got that going for them…Along comes an Annual Limited Edition (this is the 2016 edition number #01… I guess the ‘0’ signifies that they have confidence there will be at least 9 more?) called “The Bartender’s Malt”. This is an NAS release assembled via some media stunt involving a cadre of 12 “international” bartenders of some renown apparently. The slogan “For Bartenders By Bartenders” on the label threw me for a second as I am not a bartender but the price tag ($43) and the proof (47% ABV) swayed me and I picked up a bottle.I spent some time trying to delve into the contents of the vatting that make up this edition but it appears to be such a muddle of styles and ages that identifying individual characteristics is a fool’s errand Auchentoshan triple-distilled malt from 5 different decades including wood such as American oak European oak sherry casks red wine casks and German oak of all things. On their own some of those components (especially the 5th decade – do tell!) might be interesting but vatted together like this it’s all just going to taste like Auchentoshan.Although it is not discussed on the website nor the label I imagine the goal here is to create a single malt that is useful in cocktails. This explains the elevated ABV (although 47% instead of 46% smells of trying too hard) and the choice of Auchentoshan malt which is more liable to blend with other ingredients and not stand out on its own. I’m not sure why all the fanfare is necessary so the real goal is probably just another excuse for a press release.Nose Slightly spirity top notes of lemon peel light honey pale sweet malt. Pleasant but not exciting. Palate Medium syrupy body. Mild tongue burn. Raspberry white tea “cooked” malt (tastes like cooked cereal grains – like porridge – rather than fresh/raw – like… I dunno granola?). Finish Medium length. Honeycomb. Evolves slightly around malty/sweet/cereal flavors. Some mild oak tannin and a little charcoal bitterness. Fades classically with walnuts and a nice marshmallow note.With Water A few drops of water don’t seem to open up the aroma much… perhaps even closing it off instead. A rest in the glass reveals a sweet melon note. It also softens the palate a bit. Water is beneficial with this dram as long as you’re willing to be patient with it.Overall A very standard-tasting malt with no rough edges. A robust and well-chosen 47% ABV keeps it sprightly while the lowland malt keeps it sweet and unchallenging. Definitely a decent summer malt and I wouldn’t fault anyone for putting a few ice cubes in a glass of this on a hot day. Still the liquid doesn’t set itself apart from any ex-bourbon Highland malt in the $40 price range or even the entry-level American Oak if you don’t care about the ABV. You won’t be disappointed in your purchase but you also probably won’t go back looking for another bottle.
41,Auchentoshan (18 year) - I’ve come to the following conclusion about Auchentoshan malt Unless you’re allergic to flavor Auchentoshan is best as a canvas for cask-delivered flavor and does not perform well when aged in a way that minimizes the influence of oak. While distillery marketing departments might argue that this style “showcases the purity of the barley” or “lets the distillery house character shine” these are just justifications for products that taste good… but also taste of little.Auchentoshan 18 like its younger siblings the Classic the 10-year (now retired) and 12-year is triple-distilled Lowland single malt that is aged only in ex-bourbon casks. Judging by the color and flavor we’re talking refill casks here. This bottle used to retail for the refreshingly low price of around $80 (not bad for an 18 year-old) which made up for its dryness and general lack of flavor. That price has however risen past $105 recently pushing this way out of the range of acceptability. Auchentoshan 18 at $80 would have been a middling Recommended. At $105 I say look elsewhere – Glenlivet 18 might be a good alternative in the same style and it’s still $80!Nose Somewhat hot. Classically Auchentoshan – lots of distinct cereal grains and minimal wood. Vanilla sugar cookies white chocolate and blonde fudge.Palate Nice medium body just the right amount of tongue burn – enough to announce its presence. All of the aroma notes are repeated on the tongue.Finish On the short side. Sugar cookies and vanilla fudge continue to be a theme. On the finish a note of nut skins creeps in suggesting tannins but doesn’t get bitter.With Water Water brings out a little more sweetness in both the nose and on the tongue. The effect is additive and makes a few drops of water a good idea with this malt.Overall Auchentoshan 18 is a clean light elegant malt. That said it doesn’t show a great deal of improvement over younger Auchentoshan and seems to be aged in a way that picks up minimal wood. For some people that might be a blessing as it showcases the purity and delicacy of the malt (something triple distillation does as well). For me that just means it has less flavor and less complexity. As far as the price goes I think I prefer Glenlivet 18 which is better-priced and similarly light but which carries a bit more complexity and some fruity notes to boot.
42,Auchentoshan American Oak - Another permanent change in lineup this time from Auchentoshan. Gone is the bland-ish Auchentoshan Classic and in its place another NAS triple-distilled release this time matured exclusively in first-fill ex-bourbon American Oak. At a retail place of around $35 this is definitely a worthwhile upgrade. According to the press release Auchentoshan selects casks from both the top and bottom of their warehouse and marries them together to create American Oak. Thanks again to Manuela at Savona Communications for the sample.Nose Vanilla and raw barley. Notes are very similar to Irish blended whisky. Light brown sugar and freshly-cut hardwood. A slight overripe banana note underlies the rest and becomes more prominent as the dram rests. Clean crisp and light like the Auchentoshan Classic but with more apparent oak character and a little extra malty sweetness – a nice upgrade.Palate Light bodied but with a slight “simple syrup” texture. Melted vanilla ice cream some oaky tannins and mild toasted barley.Finish Short. Very slightly bitter but with pleasant notes of kettle corn as it fades.With Water A few drops of water accentuate (unfortunately) the banana notes adding green banana to the mix. Stay away from water with this one – it certainly doesn’t need it at 40% ABV.Overall As a value malt this has a few ticks in its favor over the Classic which it is replacing in the permanent Auchentoshan portfolio. The Classic suffered from anemia and definitely is bolstered by the added oak character which is well executed and doesn’t come across as an afterthought or cover-up. My one issue which might be a personal taste thing is that I cannot abide the “rotten banana” note that so often creeps into scotch aged in first-fill ex-bourbon wood. I have it on good authority however that many people find this particular banana note to be pleasant. If you’re one of those people then $35 is not an unfair price for this light straightforward NAS malt.
43,"Auchentoshan Classic - The Classic bottling of Auchentoshan (a replacement for the previous ‘Select’ bottling of pre-2008) has no age statement and is likely a vatting of various ages under the flagship 12-year expression. It is matured exclusively in ex-bourbon casks which gives it delicate vanilla notes without overpowering the nuances of the triple distillate. I picked up a bottle of The Classic recently and enjoy it immensely. I have also had a dram of the 10-year bottling which is no longer available and I thought it was very similar. My notes for the Classic followLightly colored. Nose is big on the heather (or clover?) and the honey… light and crisp. Not too dry at all. Smells floral and peachy almost like St. Germain elderflower liqueur. Very perfumed and floral even without water added to open it up. The water brings out some lemony notes which make it smell a little too much like household spray cleaner to me.Body is creamy but not terribly heavy. Caramel praline ice cream developing into lavender and clover honey. The heather pervades and introduces a green grassy throat lozenge quality. Finally a hint of bitter lemon peel. Again water emphasizes the lemon while also thinning the body and bringing out more of that cleaning solvent character.Finish is short-lived but fades with dairy cream salt water taffy and honeycomb. Not very complex but super tasty.What a satisfying dram. It is delicate and subtle sweet and crisp. Like a sugary glass of lemonade on a hot day. A little rough and undefined around the edges no doubt due to its youth which is also responsible for this whisky’s delightful crispness. I suggest skipping the water. This is by the way sometimes referred to as “The Ladies’ Malt” because it is a fine (light) introduction to malt whisky for the gentler sex. It however doesn’t make me any less of a man that I enjoy it! …right?
"
44,Auchentoshan Three Wood - Auchentoshan is usually known as a light gentle spirit originating from the Lowlands which is also known for producing generally light gentle spirits. Auchentoshan reinforces this reputation by triple-distilling its malt in the Irish style. By its very nature triple-distilled malt whisky has fewer flavor compounds – by volume – than spirit distilled by the more usual double distillation. It also has less bad flavor compounds so the style has its proponents. Throw all that out the window though if you’re looking at Three Wood. It turns out Auchentoshan in its shyness isn’t just a canvas for sherry influence but instead totally disappears under the weight of the Pedro Ximenez and Oloroso casks (the third “wood” is ex-bourbon). What results from the process – apparently 10 years in ex-bourbon (which is longer than the cheaper Classic bottling) 1 year in Oloroso sherry and then a final year in Pedro Ximenez sherry – is a sherry monster of undeniable weight and ferocity.Is it worth the extra $20 over its Classic sibling? If you like sherry more than you like Auchentoshan then yes. Yes it is.Nose A powerful blossom of sherry greets the nose. Nutty with plenty of dried fruits (predominantly fig). Some nice acidity comes through – like cranberry or red wine vinegar – and a bit of caramelized sugar. Overall the impression is of a mid-aged heavily sherried malt where the sherry is doing all of the work.Palate Viscous body heavy with notes of balsamic reduction fig paste dark chocolate and hazelnuts. Very appealing.Finish On the short side. Tarry molasses and override plums. A little minty. While the fruit notes slide to the burnt side like port reduction beginning to scorch in the pan there are some nice concentrated dried fruit notes and a heavy nuttiness that continues to the end. No undue bitterness.With Water A few drops of water might coax out a little more caramel and nut meats but doesn’t appreciably improve the experience. I’d skip it.Overall If this was once Auchentoshan then the sherry monster murdered it and stuffed it in a closet. While Auchentoshan Classic is understated vanilla and crisp this is resinous sticky-sweet and overripe. That’s not to say it’s bad. While the Auchentoshan rots slowly in its closet the sherry monster throws a wild party – the kind that ends with garments hanging from chandeliers – and there’s some value in that raw undiluted expression of sherry. Good sherry too the PX sherry really shines here. If you’re a fan of sherry in all its guises then you must grab a bottle bypass the police tape and witness the gory crime scene for yourself.
45,Baker’s Bourbon (7 year) - Yet another Jim Beam product and yet another bourbon that doesn’t taste (to me) like Jim Beam. Thank goodness. The marketing for this particular bottling claims that it’s made in small batches from a “rare jug yeast” that has been in the family for 60 years. Considering that selections for bottling are made in the warehouse not the stillroom and that all of the Small Batch and Jim Beam bourbons share the same mash bill I’m guessing that’s a load of nonsense or at least refers to the normal yeast strains used in all Beam products.This bottle comes from Batch B-90-001 and is 53.5% ABV (Baker’s is always 107 proof). It’s also seven years old. Three cheers for age statements!Nose Pine sap fresh corn with a vinegar edge to the nose tickle. Somewhat austere bourbon notes – mild notes of brown sugar oak and vanilla in balance but without the big round fullness of Booker’s. Deeper in the glass the vinegar notes turn to a pleasant tart cherry. Not a particularly sweet bourbon.Palate Thin bodied with a rehash of the tart cherry notes and distinct barrel tannins up front. Little tongue burn (surprisingly for 107 proof) and again the wood wins out over the sweetness. Not overly wooded just not very sweet. Some slightly bitter vegetal notes appear toward the end like the herbal component of bitters or aperitif liqueur.Finish Medium-long. A malty sweetness creeps out of the wood at last along with blanched almonds light brown sugar and more tart cherries. The overall impression is dry but the finish is pleasantly mildly sweet.With Water A few drops of water makes the whiskey slightly sweeter on the tongue – like a simple syrup. It also seems to tie the bourbon together and makes for a more integrated whole with less austerity. A few drops of water is a good idea with this one.Overall This is a bit of an oddball. One expects from bourbon a big sweet ball of corn syrup alcohol and oak. Here the sweetness is merely background letting nuances (including bitter and tannic ones) from the wood and perhaps the rye component play out. It does not show any of the objectionable “paint thinner” notes of white-label Jim Beam nor is it excessively bitter or hot on the tongue. One thing going for it is that this “non-sweet” style of bourbon lets a lot of nuance through that is usually covered up by the onrush of sugary flavors. This could be described as a bourbon for people who don’t like sweets. In fact if you’ve sworn off bourbon because it’s “too sweet” – this is probably worth a shot. For everyone else who likes their bourbons big bold and treacly… try before buying.
46,Balcones Texas Pot Still Bourbon - For background on Balcones read my review of their 100 proof straight rye which I liked very much indeed. The distillery’s Pot Still Bourbon is a classically-styled straight bourbon whiskey made on Balcones’ new Scottish-made Forsyth’s copper pot stills (they also have a smaller pair of Portuguese pot stills). The bourbon is aged “at least 24 months in oak” which is a statement that appears commonly on younger bourbons these days. It’s a little sad that they feel the need to put “24 months” instead of “2 years” just to sound a little bit less like it was aged the legal minimum for ‘straight’ whiskeys as is the fact that they say “in oak” as if there’s another choice. Still label nit-picking is just that so let’s move on.The Texas Pot Still Bourbon uses a unique mash bill of four grains roasted blue corn Texas wheat Texas rye and malted barley. The flavor makes me think they’re using a darker malt on the barley than is standard for most malt whiskies but I can’t find any verification online.All Balcones whiskeys are pot distilled in batches and bottled without chill-filtration or added coloring. My bottle is from batch TPSB1901 and was bottled (I assume that’s what the date means) on 2/19/2019. Note that Balcones also sells two blue-corn whiskeys a single malt the aforementioned rye and a number of special releases. The price of this Pot Still Bourbon looks very close to the 100 proof rye with most US retailers carrying both for very close to $30.Nose Shy. Whoever thought anything from Texas would be ‘shy’? Fruit leather cherry preserves (or pie if you must) dark brooding oak sugars and balsamic vinegar. An extremely long rest in the glass (~20 minutes) finally balances the aroma around a sweet base of dark chocolate torte. Delectable but took long enough…Palate Thin body. Robust tongue burn (more than expected for 46% ABV). Dusty cocoa. Oak but without too much bitterness. Chocolate malt and stout beer.Finish Medium-long. Lots of tannin from the oak – mouth-drying and almost minty. Cocoa nibs continuing the chocolate from the aroma through to the finish. Fades slowly but without adding anything.With Water More than a few drops of water increase the fruit notes (slightly) on the aroma tame the burn (slightly) on the palate and add some mint (slightly) on the finish. I (slightly) recommend water.Overall In contrast to the rye which is dialed up to 11 this bourbon takes its sweet damn time waking up and joining the party. When it does it’s a study in cocoa with several facets of dark deeply flavored chocolate. This is balanced nicely by a thread of cherry that carries through from the aroma to the finish. It’s an excellent value at $30 if you’re willing to let it wake up and don’t expect it to wow you on first contact. If you’re at the store deciding between this or the 100-proof rye and there’s only a $5 or less difference go for the rye first.
47,Balcones Texas Rye (100 Proof) - I once again admit to being way behind the eight ball. Everyone “discovered” Balcones about eight years ago and for many of you this is no doubt old news. Still everyone’s whiskey journey is unique and I’m going to use that as my excuse for not alerting you dear reader to Balcones before now. What I’m saying is that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.Balcones was making craft American whiskey in Texas before many people knew that such a thing existed. The first spirit ran from founder Chip Tate’s self-designed stills in 2009. Like a lot of upstart distillers these days the Balcones team drew from their experience with brewing beer. Whiskey is distilled beer just like brandy is distilled wine after all. With an emphasis on specialty grains and (especially) specialty malts they took their familiarity with fermentation as a process rather than a means to an end and made some truly unique whiskies. Add to this the large temperature swings common to the climate of Texas – this causes whiskies to age ‘faster’ in oak barrels – and you have a recipe for really innovative whiskeymaking. The distillery opened its new facility in Waco in 2016 featuring expanded capacity and new Forsyths copper pot stills.All Balcones whiskeys are pot distilled in batches and bottled without chill-filtration or added coloring. This particular bottle (which sounds downright placid next to siblings like Blue Corn Whiskey and Brimstone Oak-Smoked Bourbon) is distilled from a mash bill of 100% rye including Elbon Rye from Northwest Texas and crystal chocolate and roasted rye malts. The whiskey is aged for at least 18 months in oak and bottled at 50% ABV. My bottle is from Batch RYE10018-2 and is dated 6/7/2018.Nose Funky. Herbal. Chocolatey. There is a lot going on in here. I smell bruised bananas dark roast coffee funk that I haven’t smelled since Lost Spirits pine sap baker’s chocolate burnt caramel and the distinct sense that I’ve only scratched the surface.Palate Thin body. That dense snappy chocolate and roasted coffee-bean note hits first before a brief but intense tongue burn. Then the coffee is tempered with a little cream and caramel hazelnut and banana cream pie. That all sounds really sweet but the whole effect is fairly dry.Finish Long. Those chocolate notes continue inescapably dark and not-quite bitter. The finish doesn’t so much evolve as linger filling the corners of my mouth with cocoa powder and black coffee for longer than I expect from a rye. An experience.With Water Several drops of water add a black pepper note to the aroma (although it could have been there all along there’s such complexity here) and sweetens the palate. I suggest trying both without and then with a little water.Overall Wow. This is why I love (some) craft whiskies. This is so far off the map that comparing it to any old off-the-shelf rye is an exercise in futility. In other words don’t think of this as a Rye Whiskey think of it as belonging to its own category with the only closest relatives being Tom’s Foolery Lost Spirits and Westland (reviews upcoming). None of those are even ryes. Basically if you like rye or unusual whiskies or American craft whiskies or all of the above you really ought to at least try this one.Update The Pot-Still Bourbon is also pretty good.I also feel I should comment on the price. If I had paid $50 or even $60 for this bottle I would have tasted it and then nodded sagely and written something pithy about the cost of doing business as a craft distiller. I admit to finding a great deal on this bottle at $29 but even at $40 it’s quite an excellent deal and far below the average for American craft whiskey of quality. At $29 I should have bought two.
48,Ballantine’s 17 Year - Jim Murray caused a bit of an uproar when he named Ballantine’s 17 year blended scotch whisky World Whisky of the Year in his 2011 Whisky Bible. In 2010 it had climbed nearly as far – winning best blended scotch of the year. The thought of a blended scotch trumping over all single malts sent many whisky nuts (this one included) into paroxysms of rage. I had to try it.A caveat I’ve since read that Jim was tasting a newer bottling of Ballantine’s 17 – the slightly updated bottle in a blue box and the number ’17’ in larger font on the label. Since my tasting sample was a 30ml Master of Malt vial I have no clue whether it came from the blue-box or red-box Ballantine’s.Like many blends that were born in grocery stores Ballantine’s originated as a series of blends sold by a grocer named George Ballantine in 1827. It uses 50 malts but focuses on four key ‘flavor’ malts Scapa Glenburgie Miltonduff and Glentauchers. Of those I’ve only tried Scapa before. Nose Honey and honeysuckle. The honey here is refined not raw or honeycomb-like. Very floral. Vanilla. Faint hint of woodsmoke. Sweet apple cider. Buttercream frosting. Reminds me a lot of Oban 14.Palate Vanilla bean up front. Milky texture – not quite creamy. Elegant malt with pure cereal flavors. Becomes tangy near the end – lemon custard.Finish More honey on the finish. A touch of wood. No bitterness to speak of. Medium-long. Echoes of honey and buttercream frosting.With Water Water releases a puff of cinnamon a whiff of licorice and something herbal that might be peat. It doesn’t hurt the body too much but it roughens up the finish making the dram taste younger than it is. Skip the water here.Overall What’s most impressive here is the concentration of sweet desserty flavors without even a touch of bitterness on the finish. I guess that’s what you’re paying for. I could have used a little more nuttiness somewhere to round out the flavors. There is nothing here to indicate the presence of “low brow” grain whisky. After 17 years it has definitely smoothed out. It adds the body and likely some of the cereal flavors although the lack of full creaminess in the body texture makes me wonder if the grain whisky percentage in the blend is low. The overall impression is light and sweet without any eclectic or surprising flavors to distract the palate. Surely it’s very very good whisky… but I wouldn’t call it exciting.I’m not sold. Sure it’s good whisky but I’d rather spend the money on some malts that are at least as good (quality-wise) even if they aren’t as masterfully assembled. It’s like buying one piece of art from a popular artist instead of four pieces from equally-good but less-known artists for the same money. Will you enjoy the popular painting (and its inherent value) more? Probably but you can cover more wall space with the four also-rans. Maybe that’s a tortured metaphor but it works for me. If the above sounds interesting but you don’t want to drop the $90 spend the money instead on a bottle of Oban 14 which is packed with honey flavors and a bottle of Great King Street which is almost as good for half the price.
49,Bank Note Blended Scotch - Arguably times are bad. The economy is still in the dumps unemployment is high and the whisky industry is having a field day with rampant price increases. In the midst of this less-than-favorable market there are still a few good ways to get a deal. Bank Note blended scotch from the Morrison family (owners of celebrated independent bottler A.D. Rattray) is 1 liter of blended scotch for $20. That’s cheaper than… well just about everything else. Given the current market conditions at that price it -should- taste like garbage. It doesn’t. If you want something to lower your average yearly spend on scotch without having to buy Red Label stop reading this now and go buy some of this. I have no idea how long the Morrisons can maintain stock at this price but I can’t imagine they’ve got an unlimited supply; either quality or price will have to give as the market continues to balloon.Bank Note is a blend of 40% single malts to 60% scotch grain whisky. That’s WAY higher than most blends even though one must assume the malts aren’t worthy of bottling as single-cask products (or A.D. Rattray most certainly would have done so). At 43% ABV and 5 years of age (minimum) and a bonus 250ml due to the larger bottle it’s hard to justify buying any other low-end blend as long as this is available. It’s no SIA or Great King Street but it’s eminently drinkable mixable and at this price I swear I can taste the money I’m saving. Seriously I should include ‘VALUE’ in the tasting notes!Update 7 years later I have it on good authority that the quality of this blend has decreased as the Morrison family no longer has access to the mature whisky stocks that once powered Bank Note. Alas I don’t have any details on what that means but I am planning to update this review with a newly-purchased bottle soon. Also there’s now a peated version on the market.Nose Peach (indicating mild sherry) some brash young grain. Somewhat lemony but otherwise standard cereal notes. Light and inoffensive.Palate Mid-creamy body. Nougat. Lemon gummy candies. Cocoa nibs. Very mild tongue burn.Finish On the short side. Caramel and freshly-baked bread. The lemon notes turn a little bitter – like lemon pith.With Water Reveals some vanilla in the nose thins the body and washes out some of the more interesting flavors. Perhaps more citrus on the finish but I wouldn’t bother.Overall It’s certainly not bad. Compared to every other $20/liter blended scotch it stands far above the competition. It lacks a substantial aroma but presents a pleasantly sweet array of notes on the tongue and does not reveal any of the off-flavors I usually get with young grain. The finish is like the nose unremarkable. I would still prefer Great King Street if I had only one blend which is altogether more elegant and more balanced but it’s also more than twice the price. I recommend this over Johnnie Walker Black Label Chivas Dewars or any other sub-$40 blend. If this product remains available for this price it will become my standard cheap blend. A rare example these days of whisky sold for a price below its value. If you need something cheap to get your wallet through the price increases we’re seeing lately look no further.Note The “Must Try” rating reflects the quality-to-value ratio of this bottle. If you’re not looking for an alternative cheap blend then this is not “must”-anything for you.
50,Bank Note Peated Reserve Blended Scotch - You could be forgiven for calling me a Bank Note fanboy. The first words out of my mouth when someone asks about budget whisky are “Bank Note”. It makes every list of cabinet staples or “Must Haves” that I put together. It’s easily – still! – simultaneously the best deal in scotch and the best blended scotch under $40. It’s age-stated at a reasonable-for-the-price 5 years. It’s delicious and has almost no sign of youthful grain whisky. It’s relatively little-known so the price doesn’t go up and it it doesn’t go on allocation.Of course with lockdowns causing mass drink-at-home mania the liquor stores sell out of everything cheap so the last time I braved a Total Wine run I was dismayed to see I couldn’t stock up on my beloved Bank Note. They had the new Peated Reserve edition though so I figured “why not?” I’m not a huge fan of peated blends… I feel that the peat takes over but only the less-desirable cigarette ash and soil notes persist through being watered-down by grain whisky. It takes a masterful hand to make good peated blended scotch and I thought the Morrisons must have that mastery since regular Bank Note is so good.The Bank Note Peated Reserve is a little pricier – I paid $25 for 750ml when I’m used to paying $20 for 1000ml (1 liter) for the regular Bank Note. It still has a 5-year age statement and is bottled at the same 43% ABV which is a nice touch for a budget blend. The formulation which is said to be a fairly standard 40% malt and 60% lowland grain whisky is mostly the same here but with a little peated Islay malt thrown in.Nose Clear but slightly antiseptic peat. Lemon Pledge marshmallow banana. One-dimensional.Palate Thin body. Mild tongue burn that resolves into muddy marshy peat (I’m trying hard not to call it “swamp gas”. Oops I guess I just did) engine oil sheep dip molasses Thai fish sauce. Weird.Finish Medium-long. That engine oil / degreaser note persists on the finish along with black walnut oil and scorched sugar. Unpleasant.With Water Why bother? Fine ok. Several drops of water increase the smoky notes without making them more palatable. Smog. Now it smells like smog. The palate might be a little sweeter – brown sugar – but the finish is unchanged.Overall Ugh. No. I do not like this. Don’t buy it.I expect that the bottle will grow on me as I force myself to drink it so it doesn’t go to waste. (Despite hyperbole I’ve never actually poured anything down the drain.) Still the $25 could have been much better spent on a bottle of regular non-peated Bank Note or a bottle of bourbon or rye or a Johnnie Walker black label.
51,Barrell Cask Strength Bourbon (Batch 017) - So I’ve been putting this review off for a number of reasons. You can tell because I’m reviewing Batch 017 of Barrell’s batched Cask Strength Bourbon releases and they’re currently retailing batch 24. Oops. Barrell burst onto the boutique whisky scene in the mid-20-teens largely because after the single malt craze turned into the bourbon craze everything with any kind of high price tag or significant age statement had already been snatched off the shelves and was in allocation at every retailer. Suddenly here was a new name on the shelf with a whopping price tag. It had to be good right? It was the only bourbon on the shelf above $40!One of the few things I know about Barrell aside from the obnoxiously difficult-to-Google name is that they are blending American whiskies in much the same way that Compass Box blends scotches. In other words they are buying finishing and blending American bourbons and ryes and selling them at a markup albeit at cask strength and with some very reassuring details on the bottle. Still it’s been a long time (actually never) since I’ve considered $90 a good deal in bourbon. Thus I put off buying (and then put off tasting) the Barrell because I couldn’t wrap my penny-pinching nature around the idea of a pricey blended sourced bourbon.So here we are a day late and about ninety dollars short to talk about a bottle you can’t buy anymore. Batch 017 was released in early 2019 and was intended to be an homage to “classic” bourbon — the kind that is suddenly hard to find on shelves. It’s a blend of straight bourbon whiskies from Tennessee Indiana and Kentucky. The three component whiskies were all rye-flavored bourbons (mash bill corn rye and malted barley) aged 10 years and 4 months 14 years and 15 years so this bottle is “officially” 10 years and 4 months old. It’s up to you if you want to mentally count the extra age on those older casks. The Indiana bourbon is almost certainly from MGP. The rest are anybody’s guess. The batch is bottled at cask strength (technically batch strength) of 56.25% ABV. I purchased bottle #13174.I should note that the company has some excellent details on their website about each batch. Whisky producers take note Everyone should do this.Nose Shy at first with only a vague kiwi note and some far-away caramel. Now a hint of roasting coffee beans and another rest… warm cherry pie corn-heavy sweetness and dense fudgy caramel. After even longer in the glass there is a lovely cotton candy note accompanied by pistachio fudge. What a journey.Palate Hot! Hot hot hot. After a brief delay the tongue burn lights the tongue on fire. A few eye-watering moments later I can taste cherry pie (again) butterscotch dense oak and ahh who am I kidding all my taste buds are dead.Finish Long. A little dry suddenly with a lot of astringent oak mouth-drying tannins some mild charcoal and a touch of maple sugar. Lingers but doesn’t evolve.With Water Several drops of water adds a nice vegetal note (agave syrup) and causes a brief burst of floral notes. The palate burn is definitely tempered but there is still a lot of tongue-numbing fire. The water adds a bit of sweetness and fruit on the finish. This certainly benefits from the addition of water but give it a good nosing first.Overall Ok let’s get this out of the way This bourbon is “craft” (or at least hand-selected and blended) it’s cask-strength and it’s in excess of 10 years of age all of which explain its price-point. It is however not worth $90. If it were $50 I’d be singing its praises. If it were $70 I’d be conservatively talking about how rare 10 year-old cask strength bourbon is these days. At $90 I’m saying you can drink cheaper bourbon and be just as happy. It’s fine I guess with a number of delectable notes that are offset by heavy alcohol burn and periods of weird shyness.At the end of the day this is bourbon for people who think most bourbon is too cheap.
52,Basil Hayden’s Bourbon - Basil Hayden is named after the famed distiller by that name who established a farm distillery in Kentucky in 1796. He was supposedly known for using a high-rye mash bill in his bourbon which was unusual at the time. In 1882 his grandson built the R.B. Hayden & Company Distillery and named his bourbon “Old Grand-Dad” after Basil Hayden Sr. In 1992 the Jim Beam distillery (which now owns the brand and distills Old Grand-Dad whiskey) began producing a small-batch product named after Basil Hayden and using a high-rye mash bill. The whisky is bottled at 40% ABV and claimed an 8-year age statement until 2014 when the age statement disappeared from bottles (you all know what that means).The 750ml bottle sports an odd wood-and-metal “belt” around a distinctive loose paper label.Nose Lemon/lime soda syrup maraschino cherry (the bright red kind) and fruit-punch bubblegum. The aroma is VERY similar to McAfee’s Benchmark. Overall impression is light and watery with distinct but faint fruits and not much else.Palate Thin body. No tongue burn to speak of. “Smooth” I suppose but mostly this is due to lack of flavor rather than lack of harshness. A reprise of the imitation fruit flavors from the aroma but muddled and somewhat more chemical.Finish Short. The impression is of the exhaust that might issue from a chemical factory that manufactures imitation fruit flavor additives. A little tarry and very slightly bitter. Vaguely unpleasant.With Water Why you would add water to a watery 40% ABV bourbon aside the addition of a few drops yields a little dried coconut on the aroma and a little extra vanilla sweetness on the palate. Take or leave water with this one.Overall I suppose you could say this is easy to drink but then the same could be said of tutti-frutti vodka mixed down to wine-cooler strength with soda water. Basil Hayden’s is suspiciously similar to McAfee’s Benchmark No. 8 right down to the fruit punch and bubblegum. So much so that I just dragged out the remains of my bottle of Benchmark to taste these side-by-side. The Hayden’s is a little sweeter and the Benchmark is a little more tart. The Hayden’s also has possibly less “rubbing alcohol” quality but not by much. The similarities must be coincidence however as McAfee’s is made at Buffalo Trace and Hayden’s at Jim Beam. Either way I see no reason to spend $29 – $40 on a bottle of Hayden’s when one could give up the pretense and get a liter of McAfee’s for $16. They perform about equally well in cocktails.Seriously you in the liquor store aisle on your cellphone If you’re looking for cheap bourbon put the Hayden’s back and look for McAfee’s or Four Roses Yellow Label. If you’re looking for good bourbon get some Buffalo Trace Knob Creek (also by Jim Beam) or (better) Eagle Rare 10 or Four Roses Single Barrel/Small Batch.
53,Belle Meade Straight Bourbon - This is the kind of thing I like to cover. Sourced whiskey yes but from an actual startup distillery with an actual still that is now producing its own actual distilled whiskey. Nelson’s Green Brier distillery in Nashville Tennessee was a pre-prohibition powerhouse in the Tennessee Whiskey scene (complete with the Lincoln County Process which is now required by law to bottle something called Tennessee Whiskey). The distillery closed its doors at the advent of Prohibition in 1909. Descendants of the original Charles Nelson reinvigorated the brand starting in 2009 and rebuilt the old distillery in Nashville.To get the ball rolling as many new distilleries must they purchased bourbon (note not Tennessee Whiskey) from Midwest Grain Products (MGP formerly known as LDI) and bottled it under the Belle Meade label one of Charles Nelson’s original brands. In a fitting ode to the way the industry worked then as now the pre-prohibition Belle Meade was actually originally contracted to Nelson from a third party. The whiskey chosen from MGP was a 6-8 year-old “high rye” straight bourbon in batches of four barrels each and was bottled without chill filtration at 45.2% ABV. The modern Nelsons also finished a number of casks in a variety of wine barrels and an array of Belle Meade finishes can be found on shelves.The distillery itself has been laying down Tennessee Whiskey under the Nelson’s label from a recipe cobbled together from historical sources which we should see in distribution soon.So yet another MGP bourbon huh? Let’s see what $35 worth of MGP gets usNose Oak-heavy with strong astringent woody notes cherry juice cherry cough syrup cloves and dark brown sugar. As the drink rests in the glass that brown sugar aroma intensifies and it picks up additional rye spice notes like mace and cacao.Palate A little dry up front with a thin body. A strong tongue burn interrupts tasting but resumes with a nice array of hard candies cinnamon red-hots corn syrup molasses and almond extract (marzipan).Finish A nice balance between dry and sweet and not bitter. Fades with cherry blanched almonds and a bunch of baking spices including cinnamon.With Water A few drops of water makes the aroma a lot sweeter – including vanilla frosting and sweet cream. The palate is largely the same as is the finish. Water is welcome but not needed.Overall A very nice but very middle-of-the-road bourbon. It’s a little pricey for the category at $35 though where you can find gems like 1792 or (VOB if you’re lucky enough to live where it’s sold) for under $30. Still I can’t be sad about MGP high-rye bourbon at 6 years of age. Any amount of the bottle that I don’t drink neat will make very nice Old Fashioneds and Whiskey Sours.
54,BenRiach Heart of Speyside - I am possibly not the fan of BenRiach that I’m supposed to be. On paper it all looks great It’s the sister distillery of GlenDronach of which I am an unrepentant fanboy. It uses ‘craft presentation’ for most of its malts (46% ABV no added color or chill filtration) and it’s as close to independently-owned as distilleries get these days. They have a slew of excellent finishes and their pricing is not quite as predatory as the bigger names. Still every time I come across a BenRiach that isn’t heavily-sherried I falter.Here we have “Heart of Speyside” an NAS malt that was meant to compete with bottom-shelfers like Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve or Tomatin Legacy until it was scrapped in the recent label redesign and portfolio reshuffle. BenRiach may feel the same way about the whisky as I do It no longer exists on their website even in the “Archive” section. Scrubbed from the Internet… what a way to go. Kudos to BenRiach though Their core lineup is now entirely age-stated starting at 10 years old. (The NAS expressions show up in Travel Retail.)This bottle can still be found lingering at a few retailers. If you’re standing in the store looking at it right now I’ll save you a read skip it. There are better options.As for technical details it’s a no-age-statement single malt distilled at BenRiach. It doesn’t say online but I’m guessing it’s entirely from ex-bourbon casks. Bottled at 40% ABV without added coloring and without chill filtration. It’s like the scrawny little brother of ‘craft presentation’.For those following along yes I am extending my streak of reviewing whiskies that have already been discontinued and thus are of no interest to my readers. How am I not better at this after 10 years of blogging?Nose Light lemony sweet. Shortbread cookies. Fresh hay vanilla cream banana cream pie. A bit thin or airy… could definitely use a higher bottling proof. A rest in the glass reveals some florals especially rosewater.Palate Thin watery body. Mild tongue burn. Various bakery goods (sugar cookies) slightly bitter barrel char and walnuts. The longer it’s on the tongue the more the bitter outweighs the sweet.Finish On the short side. The same notes from the palate persist. Slightly bitter. Fades without evolving.With Water As if this needs watering down. What? Fine. A few scant drops of water add a little vanilla frosting to the aroma and the palate. As expected it does little for the experience. Still if you’re not enjoying your glass try adding a little water.Overall Why anyone bottles any single malts at 40% ABV anymore is beyond me. This would probably be a rich inviting example of classic Speyside single malt at 46% ABV but instead it’s thin and watery. The thinness allows bitter elements to show through instead of being the foil to sweetness that they are in more robust malts. In essence by taking out the things that make a single malt expensive (time in oak and high proof) they’ve taken out the things necessary to make this a good whisky. It’s not bad certainly but it’s not exciting.
55,Benromach (10 year) - Benromach like many of the lesser-known distilleries in Scotland has been subject to long periods of closure and changes of ownership. Its malt has been used principally for blending until the new millenium when new owners Gordon & MacPhail (independent bottlers) gave the distillery a fresh lease on life with a refurbishment and a marketing push for a new line of single malts. They also have a phenomenal website with a very hearty dose of the kind of information that most producers are lacking. I was able to taste the lineup at a recent tasting event in Redwood City CA. Overall I thought Benromach malts offer good value for the money although the distillery has some distance to go before it truly wows.The 10-year flagship bottling was aged for 9 years in a combination of 80% ex-bourbon and 20% ex-sherry casks (all first-fill) and then married for 1 additional year in first-fill European oak oloroso sherry casks. The sherry barrels are sourced from Bodegas Williams & Humbert in Jerez. Bourbon barrels come from Heaven Hill and Jim Beam. For the 10-year Benromach uses malt peated to a delicate 12 – 14 ppm using Highland peat. This is to emulate the style of “traditional” Speyside whiskies which were routinely malted using peat fires before the advent of new heating technologies (and new tastes in lighter-style whiskies for blending). The result is bottled at 43% ABV with no added color.What I like about Benromach is that it’s a tiny distillery (2 stills and 4 wooden washbacks) owned by an independent Scottish company that is producing truly “craft” whisky in an industry and a country dominated by large-scale multinational firms. Distilleries like this are a dying breed and it’s nice to see one with new life breathed into it by a dedicated owner.Nose Nice round grain-forward aroma. Vanilla lemon grains of paradise and faint caramelized sugars. Lightly earthy (mushrooms) and only slightly grassy (or perhaps mossy). A rest in the glass brings the elements together into a more rounded whole.Palate Slightly creamy body. Malty with standard ex-bourbon notes (vanilla caramel) plus a tinge of anise lemon peel and light peat. Where’s the sherry?Finish Medium-long. Warming with mouth-drying tannis but not bitter. More earthy “slightly peated” notes but fades with brown sugar.With Water A few drops of water brings out vanilla frosting in the aroma along with slight nuttiness and perhaps raisin. Added peat on the finish. Water is definitely of benefit with this dram.Overall Nice! Simple but full-flavored. Peat is subtle but in nice balance. (Note that a previous tasting of earlier batches showed elements of young “new make” on the nose. These are absent with the recent batch that I sampled.) Still this does not rise significantly above your “standard” ex-bourbon single malt especially as I could not detect any sherry notes at all. The fact that as much as 20% of the vatting comes from first-fill sherry and that the whole was finished in oloroso sherry completely escapes me in the glass. At $45 this is a reasonable choice for a rotating daily dram. I probably wouldn’t pay much more than that.
56,Benromach (15 year) - Benromach’s entry-level 10 year-old bottling is aged in a combination of 80% ex-bourbon and 20% ex-sherry casks (all first-fill) and then married for 1 additional year in first-fill European oak oloroso sherry casks. The 15 year however continues that final aging for an additional 5 years (for a total of 6 years) in oloroso. This extra aging gives the whisky a mahogany color and a deep resinous sherry character. The sherry barrels are sourced from Bodegas Williams & Humbert in Jerez. Bourbon barrels come from Heaven Hill and Jim Beam. For the 10-year and 15-year Benromach uses malt peated to a delicate 12 – 14 ppm using Highland peat. This is to emulate the style of “traditional” Speyside whiskies which were routinely malted using peat fires before the advent of new heating technologies (and new tastes in lighter-style whiskies for blending). The final whisky is bottled at 43% ABV with no added color.I was able to taste the lineup at a tasting event in Redwood City CA along with the Peat Smoke Organic NAS and Imperial Proof 10-year.Nose Deep sherry. Butterscotch fig and strawberry jam. Complex and a bit funky.Palate A bit hot. Oaky and buttery with resinous dried fruit. There’s a lot of depth to explore here and I wasn’t able do it justice with a single pour.Finish Medium-long. Tannic and a bit nutty with fading slight bitterness. Surprisingly dry and timid considering the depth on the palate.With Water A few drops of water highlight brighter fruit notes on the nose and add peanut butter to the palate. The water also balances out the sherry and the tannic notes better.Overall Well the balance that I like to see in a sherried malt is not really there. We have some funky resinous sherry notes but no fruit-forward “bomb”. The jam notes are muddy like red wine dregs which pulls the whole experience off-center. I would enjoy this if it were budget-priced (like Glenfiddich 15) but at $100 retail this is an easy skip.
57,Benromach Imperial Proof (10 year) - The 10-year flagship bottling is aged for 9 years in a combination of 80% ex-bourbon and 20% ex-sherry casks (all first-fill) and then married for 1 additional year in first-fill European oak oloroso sherry casks. For Benromach’s Imperial Proof bottling which is part of the distillery’s classic lineup this same whisky is bottled at 57% ABV instead of 43%. This is 100° in British (or “Imperial”) proof. The confusing difference with American proof (easily calculable at twice the ABV) has to do with differences in the composition of the gunpowder used to provide flammable “proof” that a whisky was of adequate strength for sale. We can all smile and nod at the “100 proof” and then just go by ABV.Sherry barrels used for maturation are sourced from Bodegas Williams & Humbert in Jerez. Bourbon barrels come from Heaven Hill and Jim Beam. For the 10-year Benromach uses malt peated to a delicate 12 – 14 ppm using Highland peat. This is to emulate the style of “traditional” Speyside whiskies which were routinely malted using peat fires before the advent of new heating technologies (and new tastes in lighter-style whiskies for blending).This whisky is bottled without added color or chill-filtration. If you’re looking for this overseas it’s labelled “Benromach 100 Proof” outside of the US. I was able to taste the Benromach lineup at a recent tasting event in Redwood City CA.Nose Very hot (of course). Orange peel and hard candies. And fire.Palate Redolent of orange peel and orange candies although it’s hard to taste through all that fire. Reminds me of a mix of cask-strength Dalmore with Ardbeg Corryvreckan although with far less peat.Finish Long and drying. More of the same candied orange.With Water A generous splash of water helps bring out toffee flavors on the nose and makes the palate sparkly with bright fruit and a bit of earthy peat. I highly recommend braving the full strength for a sip or two and then retreating to the water.Overall A bright fierce whisky. Great both with or without water but at full proof it’s a tongue-blinding flashbang of orange oil and alcohol burn that prevents much deeper analysis. I’d call this a bit one-dimensional but that one dimension is awful tasty. Interesting that the same 10 year that came across mushroomy and wood-centric would be so transformed into an orangey confection when bottled at a higher proof. Perhaps a consequence of barrel selection?At $90 this is a little steep for me as I’d prefer Ardbeg Corryvreckan for the same effect with more complexity and a deeper peat profile. A 10 year-old for nearly $100 is hard to stomach even these days. Still everyone at the tasting event agreed that this was the star and the age-statement and craft overhead warrants a bit steeper price tag. If you like sherry and tongue-searing (nearly) cask-strength whiskies you’ll probably enjoy this one.
58,Benromach Organic - I have conflicting emotions about organic whiskies. Personally I choose organic produce and meats when shopping to reduce my family’s intake of residues from pesticides such as Monsanto’s Roundup which have been detected in everything from wine and food to human blood and breastmilk. As GMO crops are more and more widely-used in the US and other non-European agricultural centers the use of such pesticides (which have synergies with the genes inserted into engineered crop strains) has continued to increase. That said I have a hard time imagining that those residues would persist through the distillation process. Even if I did have that concern there are only a handful of organic whiskies on the market and restricting myself to those is unthinkable. 🙂 Still I’m a big proponent of the use of heritage and heirloom strains of barley and other grains in whiskies and I think that the more care and consideration goes into the growing of the grains the more quality one can expect in the final distilled product.Benromach a tiny distillery with only 2 stills and owned by independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail produces a range of craft single malts. The Organic is part of their “Contrasts” series. I was able to taste the Organic along with their standard lineup at a recent tasting event in Redwood City CA.Unlike Benromach 10 this single malt is matured in virgin oak barrels with a light char (as opposed to the heavy char used in bourbon barrels) for an undisclosed time – reportedly around 5 and a half to 6 years. The malted barley used is 100% certified organic and this release (in 2006) was the first-ever certified organic single-malt scotch. The whisky is bottled at 43% ABV without added color.Nose Nutty but similar to the 10 year. Brown sugar and a little charcoal.Palate Light almost watery body. Slightly tart (lemon/lime).Finish Medium-short. Bubblegum! Somewhat floral. Rosewater?With Water A dash of water brings out an unfortunate “white dog” vegetal/grassy note on the aroma. After a rest in the glass this transforms into ripe banana on both the nose and palate.Overall Interesting containing oaky flavors but without heaviness or bitter tannins. Nice nuttiness but the reaction to water betrays its youth. That grassiness reminds me of previous batches of Benromach 10 year which I did not detect in my review of a recent batch. I’d go out on a limb and say that Benromach needs to reach an approximate age of 10+ years to taste properly mature. I would not spend $15 more to get a younger less-tasty version of the 10-year even if it is organic. Note that I would be willing to pay that premium for an organic release with a 10 year-old age statement if it was at least as good as the standard one.Note Any discussion in the comments of the science of GMOs or the health consequences of consuming them will be considered off-topic and removed. Please talk about the whisky not about food politics.
59,Benromach Peat Smoke - This keeps happening to me. I like Benromach well enough especially the Imperial Proof 10 year-old I love peated Islay whiskies and I’m a fan of the lightly-peated (10-12 ppm) style used across all of Benromach’s other malts. So when presented with a glass of the “Peat Smoke” release from the distillery’s “Contrasts” series I was enthusiastic. However just like The BenRiach Curiositas (which on paper I should love) and anything from Ledaig I just cannot get behind the character of malt smoked with mainland peat.The differences are obvious Island (and Islay) whisky is made from malted barley smoked over fires of peat dug from ocean-adjacent peat bogs often full of seaweed or beach grasses and continuously sprayed by seawater-laden winds. The effect of that peat is complex funky salty medicinal and downright bracing. Mainland peat however is composed of Highland grasses and shrubs. When barley is smoked with this peat it becomes infused with the smells of a woodland campfire – slightly piney but mostly one-dimensional woodsmoke. Whiskies made from this malt tend (in my opinion) towards extreme dryness non-complexity (not a word I know) and anemic sparseness. I just don’t like them.I guess what I’m trying to say is that I didn’t like Benromach Peat Smoke… but you might! Don’t take my word for it especially if you’ve ever enjoyed a peated malt from a mainland distillery. Maybe I’m just unjustly prejudiced against non-Island peat.That stats are right-on though. The Peat Smoke release is made from barley smoked to 67 ppm (that’s pretty high Ardbeg is 55 ppm (except Supernova at 100 ppm) and Bruichladdich Octomore the highest is in the 160s) and is aged in first-fill ex-Bourbon casks (from Heaven Hill and/or Jim Beam) for between 9 and 10 years although the bottle carries no age statement. The whisky is bottled at 46% ABV with no added color.I was able to taste the Benromach Peat Smoke along with their standard lineup at a recent tasting event in Redwood City CA.Nose Woodsmoke (smoldering campfire) vanilla and light oak. Somewhat anemic and very dry.Palate Black pepper and a lot more smoldering campfire.Finish A fading slightly bitter reprise of the vanilla-and-smoke motif.With Water A few drops of water add some floral notes – like white tea – which are quickly voided by the smokiness.Overall Not a fan. As with Curiositas and a few other malts I’ve tasted that were peated with Highland peat I found it anemic dry and too simplistic. Especially at around $60 I’d much rather have just about anything from Islay especially something full-flavored AND subtle like Kilchoman Machir Bay.
60,Bernheim Original (7 year) Small Batch Wheat Whiskey - Bernheim Original although it looks and tastes like bourbon is not in fact bourbon. It is a straight wheat whiskey and thus shares with bourbon an aging (of minimum 2 years) in new charred oak barrels and cannot contain flavoring or coloring agents. Bernheim Original owned by Heaven Hill Distilleries is made primarily from soft winter wheat aged at least 7 years and is bottled in batches containing no more than 100 barrels (thus the “small batch” designation). Note that this is distinct from “wheater” bourbons like Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon W.L. Weller 12 Larceny and Maker’s Mark which use wheat as a flavor grain (instead of rye). Bernheim’s mashbill contains at least 51% wheat with the remainder being corn and a small amount of barley for enzymes.Bernheim Original is distilled at the Heaven Hill Bernheim Distillery in Louisville Kentucky and is aged and bottled at the Old Bernheim Distillery site (which no longer distills) in Bardstown Kentucky. The whisky is named after the old distillery (and the distillery’s own namesake the Bernheim brothers who founded the I.W. Harper brand and the original distillery).A few years ago Heaven Hill bucked the NAS trend by adding an age-statement to the label of Bernheim Original during a redesign thus turning an NAS whiskey into a 7 year-old whiskey without changing the bottle contents or drumroll please the price! Good on you Heaven Hill. Bernheim Original has been on the market since 2005.Nose A piercing mix of sour cherry fragrant blooming fruit trees and orange peel. Under that a layer of toasted almonds and a heavy wheaty graininess like cake dough (or poundcake). There is a tinge of acetone but it is thoroughly overpowered by the robust fruit and grain aromas.Palate Thick body with more cherry (syrup) and orange (bitters). There is an unctuous honey-like sweetness somewhere in between processed honey and molasses. Brown sugar and smoky charred oak round out the flavor.Finish Medium-long. Sweet and nutty fading slowly with candied nuts and then fresh walnuts. A hint of bitterness but not too much.With Water A few drops of water reveal an interesting licorice note as well as the usual buttercream/vanilla aromas. No change in taste or finish. Water optional especially at the very-drinkable 45% ABV bottling strength.Overall A tasty whiskey with a lot of the sweetness and oak flavors one would expect from a 7 year-old spirit in new oak casks. There’s a nice balance of tart fruit florals and heavier sugary notes and it’s neither cloying nor does it ever taste fake like a lot of “corn syrup” bourbons. I can also say from experience that it makes a very refined cocktail. It is lighter in character than most bourbons.This gives my current house bourbon Eagle Rare 10 a run for its money. At a lower price point I could easily switch to this without any remorse.
61,Big Peat - Independent bottler Douglas Laing has been weathering the dry years (decades?) of the single-malt boom by making its name on blended malt whiskies such as Timorous Beastie Rock Island and Big Peat. The bottler still puts out excellent casks of single malt under its Old Particular label and I have been very pleasantly surprised by the value offered by some of them. That said it’s a dry time for independent bottlers because there is so little “extra” scotch lying around in warehouses for them to snap up resulting in a corresponding drop in quality (or more commonly a drastic rise in price) across the whole independent market. Some bottlers like Gordon and MacPhail have decided to stop trying to beat them and joined them via the purchase of a distillery (Benromach) while others such as Douglas’s brother Hunter Laing have gone a different route and started building a distillery (Ardnahoe) to stay in the game. In fact Douglas Laing is also building a distillery in Glasgow called Clutha which should begin distillation this year.Big Peat has been a cult favorite of sorts with early batches raising acclaim from younger whisky drinkers that associate the brand with a departure from old staid scotch norms. The brand’s mascot is a windblown bearded cartoon Ileach (that’s the word for a Scot who lives on Islay) who looks more at home on a cereal box than a whisky bottle and helps to convey this bucking of tradition. The special cask-strength Christmas bottlings that depict Big Peat dressed up as Santa Claus are especially amusing.The liquid itself is 100% Islay single malt from the distilleries of Caol Ila Bowmore Ardbeg and Port Ellen and is bottled without added color or chill-filtration at 46% ABV. The whisky is so pale as to be almost clear and bears a striking resemblance to Lagavulin 8 year although the same could be said of most younger peated malts. That Port Ellen component is interesting as Port Ellen is basically gone from retail markets. Presumably Douglas Laing’s independent bottling arm has a stock of Port Ellen barrels and has been dipping into them to keep the vatting in Big Peat consistent although the actual percentages are a secret. It could literally be a teaspoon although I’ve read that the Christmas bottlings contain a significant percentage of the rare malt. To my taste the majority of the blend is Caol Ila and all of it fairly young.Nose Initial aroma is puzzling. Dry white wine blanco tequila and a distinct lack of peat. A rest in the glass opens up a little peat in the form of classic ocean-influenced brine and distant campfire smoke. Emphasis on “little”.Palate Slightly syrupy body. The peat is more evident here with a lot of earthy/fungal peat and a touch of smolder. Dry with only a hint of bland simple-syrup for sweetness.Finish Medium-long. A swath of menthol and a hint of orange peel. The same peat notes from the palate continue here but fade without change. A ghost of cherry or tart plum concludes the finish.With Water A few drops of water make the aroma more piercing and the peat more smoke-forward. The palate now thinner is only slightly sweeter (vanilla fudge). On the whole the experience is better. Like 10% better. Go for the water. Overall I have tried Big Peat several times in the past but this is my first formal review. I have thought before – and continue to think today – that this bottle is misnamed. Nothing about this – let alone the peat – is big. 46% ABV is a nice choice but hardly “big” in the context of available peat monsters. All of the flavors are reticent and nothing stands out. It’s certainly less brash and more drinkable than some cheap peated malts but it’s not any more interesting to drink. If I’m being uncharitable (why stop now?) this is a peated blended malt for people who are scared of actual peated single malts. And did I mention the cost? Around here it’s about $65 a bottle and the best price I could find online was $56. That quite a shell-out considering that Ardbeg 10 is still under $50.Lastly – and this is purely my own aesthetic – the bottle label is silly. I don’t prefer to associate serious whiskies with cartoon characters. Unless they’re marketing this to minors (I hope not!) or comic convention goers I don’t see the point.I’m sure there are a lot of Big Peat adherents in the comments and as usual with the very subjective hobby of whisky tasting I’d say good on you for knowing what you like! That’s way more important than agreeing with some noob on the Internet. This bottle is just not for me.
62,Black Bottle Blended Scotch - I’ve had a lot of recommendations for this. Lesson learned Commenters know what’s up! This is good stuff at an amazing price. Read onBlack Bottle is a blended scotch comprised of (according to the website) “seven of the island [Islay]’s classic malts alongside some of the finest grain available.” Since Islay only has eight active distilleries (Lagavulin Laphroaig Ardbeg Bowmore Caol Ila Bruichladdich Bunnahabhain and the too-recently-opened Kilchoman) and it’s unlikely to contain any of the very rare and sought-after closed distilleries (Malt Mill Port Ellen) I think we can safely say what’s in it. In fact before Kilchoman opened Black Bottle’s marketing verbage proudly proclaimed the inclusion of product from “all of Islay’s single malt distilleries”. The Black Bottle brand is now owned by Burn Stewart Distillers Ltd. which also owns Bunnahabhain so it’s also a safe bet that a lot of that distillery’s malt makes it into the blend.Black Bottle tends to win a lot of awards and has quite a following even among malt-heads. Oh here’s the kicker this guy’s only about $20 a bottle in the US.Nose Tarry earthy overtones with a smoky barbeque sauce-like sweetness. Oh God now I can’t smell anything but barbeque sauce! The alcohol tickle is piquant – despite the baseline 40% ABV this crawls right up your nose. Undercurrents of chewing tobacco and mulching leaves.Palate Nice creamy mouthfeel. Green and vegetal up front then some salted caramels and finally a burst of woodsmoke. Very tame on the tongue. Really it’s very orderly for something that’s all Islay.Finish Only of medium length despite all the peat. Sweet burnt sugar freshly-dug earth. Very mild bitterness in the back on the tongue. Remains sweet and smoky through the fade-out. Pleasant.With Water Several drops of water yield processed white sugar in the nose but kill the smoke. Mouthfeel is not compromised but the finish is more grassy and bitter. This doesn’t need water – I wouldn’t bother.Overall I can see why this has a following. It’s peaty in all the right ways has the thick viscous mouthfeel that only a blend with good grain whisky has and is the right price. At $20 this blows The Black Grouse Finlaggan and the mildly-peated Johnnie Walker Black Label out of the water no contest. Really a $20 peated blend and I can’t find anything bad to say about it.Also it’s worth pointing out that this bottle is a perfect choice for mixed drinks that call for a smoky note. While most of us wouldn’t dream of pouring Lagavulin 16 into a shaker Black Bottle has both the price point and the level of quality necessary to be great in a cocktail.I suppose if you were jaded enough you could say this blend is on the tame side of the peat spectrum. Personally when I’m in the mood for peat I want the full intense single-malt experience so I’m not likely to stock a bottle of this… but if you’ve been frustrated in your efforts to find a value blend and enjoy peat this is your bottle. Either way I’m calling it a “Must Have” because you can’t find a better peated blend – or almost any blend for that matter – for this price.
63,"Black Maple Hill Small Batch Bourbon - What is “Sour Mash”? Many a bottle of bourbon proudly displays this moniker as if I should both know what it means and also be impressed. A quick Google search and I now know it means they dump some of the previous spent fermented mash into the new mash in order to start the fermentation process with an injection of live yeasts. A similar process is used in the making of sourdough bread. This has the double effect of kickstarting the new fermentation and also controlling the initial growth of unwanted microorganisms. As nearly all bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey brands use the process and has no discernible effect on flavor it’s really not something that belongs on a label. Tradition is tradition however and so I sat down to drink some highly recommended Black Maple Hill Small Batch Sour-Mash Kentucky Straight Bourbon. Yeesh.Aged in American white oak and bottled at a hefty 47.5% ABV (95 proof) Black Maple Hill is a vatting of vintages in a “small batch” from KBD (Kentucky Bourbon Distillers) a group owned by the storied Willet family which doesn’t (yet!) distill any of its own product but rather sources it from (several) other distillers in Kentucky.
In a previous version of this post I mentioned that some Black Maple Hill was distilled at Heaven Hill in Kentucky and was corrected by an astute reader. After some more Internet research all I can say is that the whole issue is hopelessly confused. KBD owns the barrels of the source whiskey but nobody knows for sure where it was distilled or whether that location changed recently and heralded a decrease in the quality of the brand. Regardless my bottle says “Bardstown KY” which may (or may not) indicate anything about its provenance. It’s from a very recent batch. Nose Perfectly round – practically spherical. All the characters are here piquant cinnamon sticky toffee pine sap and freshly-hewn oak. The bold 95 proof crawls up your nose but it carries aroma with it. Deep under all the cooked sugar flavors (caramel toffee the gooey stuff in pecan pie) there is a narrow band of cherry fruit and coconut. Despite the name I don’t get any maple syrup!Palate Medium bodied. Soft on the palate initially but then it burns with the full strength of 95 proof. Distinctly sweet with prominent cherry notes mild spices and a deep resounding woodiness.Finish Pretty long. Coconut sets in at first evolving into vanilla bean espresso and sour cherry lozenge with an entire lack of bitterness! Trails off with some slight hazelnut.With Water Water brings out some interesting vegetal notes – green banana leaves lime peel raw sugar cane. However it thins the body and disarms the potency of the alcohol and the flavors with it. Toss a few drops in your last sip but don’t water the whole glass.Overall No low points although it verges on woody in places. Round and bold in the nose soft and sweet on the tongue and lingering on the finish. This stuff is hard to find and very much delivers. To my bourbon-novice palate it’s dang good for under $40. The brand is not as fervor-inducing as Pappy Van Winkle but it blows some similarly-profiled bourbons like Knob Creek out of the water. I have to say if this is inferior to the old Heaven Hill distillate I definitely missed out!Update David D. at K&L just posted a few more tidbits about Black Maple Hill how it’s sourced and why it’s rare at the moment. Short story It’s a blend made at KBD from Kentucky bourbon sourced from who-knows-where. According to Drew Kulsveen at KBD it’s “made with whiskey from two different distilleries and the formula has never changed. It’s always been the same recipe.” As David D. puts it Black Maple Hill is an independent label purchased from another independent label. Of course we still don’t know which bourbon(s) it contains or how old they are. Ah well. [David’s Post]

64,Blanton’s Single Barrel Bourbon - Blanton’s a brand owned by Sazerac is distilled (as is everything these days it seems) at Buffalo Trace distillery in Kentucky. Considered to be the first brand to release a “single barrel” bourbon (in 1984) the company selects barrels only from the center of their “Warehouse H” facility to be considered for single-barrel bottling. These notes are from barrel #150.Nose Rye influenced (nutmeg and mixed spices) some cherrywood nutmeg and cinnamon. Rich golden hay cornmeal and a hint of cider.Palate Creamy body. Corny burn and cinnamon red-hots resolve into luscious caramel and vanilla fudge ice cream and maple syrup.Finish Medium length corn-heavy finish with lingering rye spices – the nutmeg comes back with a vengeance.Overall Still trying to get over corn flavors in bourbon but there’s nothing offensive or “plastic” about the corn notes here. The dominant rye character and skillful maturation make this a very tasty dram although one you’re certainly paying for. Worth a try if you see it at a bar but I only suggest buying a bottle if you know beforehand that this hits your “sweet spot” of preferred styles.
65,Bomberger’s Declaration Bourbon - Man these whiskey companies don’t make it easy. What looks like a nice new well-priced bourbon with an historic name is actually a whiskey distilled at an unknown distillery aged for an unknown amount of time bottled by a non-distiller producer (NDP) having appropriated the name of a closed distillery to honor that closed distillery’s original name in an effort to prevent a second NDP from using the name. I think. Let’s see if we can unravel this.The Michter’s distillery (which was known as the Bomberger Distillery up until the 1970s) closed in 1990 and allowed its trademarks to lapse. Chatham Imports registered for the trademarks in 1996 and began selling Michters again using bourbon secured from an unnamed distillery (a practice commonly used by companies referred to as “non-distiller producers” or NDPs). Enter Heritage Spirits a new company looking to revitalize the old Michter’s distillery under the Bomberger name. (This plan has been abandoned and the company is building a new distillery nearby.) Michter’s quickly released Bomberger’s Declaration in a transparent bid to secure the rights to the Bomberger name by bringing it to market first. Read a much better description of the events here if you’re interested.So what DO we know? Not much. Michter’s US1 and other Michter’s releases have come from a variety of distilleries by rumor including old stocks of Stitzel-Weller (not anymore I guarantee it) KBD (the logical choice) and possibly Brown-Forman. Some of their whiskey was made for them by contract and the rest probably via bulk purchase or purchase of aged or partially-aged stock. Really there’s not much point in speculating because any given bottle with a Michter’s brand name on it could have come from basically anywhere.My bottle (Bottle 1809 of a “small batch” of 2139 bottles from Batch #1bL1344) is 54% ABV and cost $43. I should note that the allocation at K&L sold out almost immediately. There’s apparently still power in the old name. The bottle label claims the whiskey inside was distilled and bottled in Kentucky and as a Straight Bourbon with no age statement must be at least four years of age and aged in new charred oak barrels.Nose Sweet and oily with heavy oak presence verging on smoky (like fruitwood smoke) but not actually… you know… smoky. A dash of fruit – mostly cherry and orange peel – adds range. A very full robust aroma.Palate Medium bodied. Hot. Oaky tannins immediately coat the mouth creating a sense of astringency. This is balanced as the wood sugars arrive punctuated by hints of cherry and orange peel (again) although the overall flavor is not as sweet as was promised by the nose. Finish Medium-long. Some charcoal and more astringent woodiness. Here there is a suggestion of mint and over-brewed tea. Fades with drying mouth-puckering tannins and the last of the fruit now dried and dusty.With Water A few drops of water add a vanilla buttercream note to the aroma and tames the palate burn slightly. No huge surprises but a little water isn’t a bad idea here.Overall Despite the astringent notes (which I generally don’t like) I was impressed by the versatility and range of this whiskey. Deep oaky notes are balanced nicely against a mid-level sweetness and high notes of fresh fruit. Not too sweet not too oaky and not (quite) too hot. The aroma however is the best part and the rest of the experience pales somewhat in comparison.The whole is somewhere in-between the vegetal dryness of Buffalo Trace (but without the grassiness) and the sweet oakiness of Eagle Rare 10 but at a hefty proof. The whiskey is almost certainly not from Buffalo Trace so a more apt comparison might be to the new Old Forester releases from Brown-Forman which have a lot of similarities.However you feel about Chatham Imports or exactly what they are “declaring” with this release this is a tasty whiskey at an appropriate price.
66,Booker’s Bourbon (Batch C07-B-7) - After receiving a generous sample of Booker’s from Sarah at DBC (thanks Sarah!) I thought it high time to revisit my old review of Booker’s which was made under some duress. Also as a small batch product (one of Beam’s Small Batch Collection) variations between batches are expected. This bottle is from Batch C07-B-7 and is 7 years and 2 months old and bottled at cask strength 65.4% ABV. It is neither colored nor chill-filtered.Booker’s named after creator Booker Noe (Master Distiller for Jim Beam for 40 years) is bottled unfiltered and at cask strength in small batches after 6 – 8 years of age in heavily charred oak barrels (#4 char). Originally Booker Noe hand-chose aging barrels from the center of the rickhouse (both vertically from the center floors of a nine-floor rickhouse and horizontally at the ‘heart’ of the facility) to bottle at full strength as gifts for friends and family. Eventually he released those same selections to the general public. This style is a throwback to the original days of American whiskey when jugs of whiskey would be filled for customers directly from the barrel.Beam Global (now owned by Suntory) is a dichotomy for me. For one it’s known far and wide as the producer of Jim Beam “White Label” one of my least favorite whiskies of all time and the bane of my college years. Jim Beam’s “White Label” bourbon is the one and only reason that I thought I hated whisky for the first decade of my drinking life. And yet the very same distillery that cranks out industrial quantities of that hideous liquid also produces some of my favorite bourbon including Knob Creek Baker’s and Booker’s. This is especially odd considering that (as far as I can tell?) all Beam straight bourbons are the same mashbill and the vast flavor differences are down solely to age and warehouse location.Nose Chocolate-covered caramels. Root beer floats with vanilla ice cream. The aromas are aggressive at 65.4% but subtleties and complexities lie hidden beneath that blanket of alcohol vapor. Something vegetal and rooty like sassafras or filé powder. A strong sense of sappy dark oak pervades but the interplay between the sticky-sweet candy notes and the vegetal root notes drive the complexity. After a rest in the glass a billowing cloud of butterscotch cake icing emerges. Yum.Palate It burns like fire! After much eye-watering and stamping of feet I’m finally able to taste cinnamon red-hots tannin-y charred oak (slightly bitter) and caramel hot cocoa. This is simply too strong to taste much at full proof.Finish Long and warming. The sweet candy notes return on the finish along with Christmas mulling spices and and an overall feeling of well-being for having surmounted the obstacle… not unlike the feeling which must follow walking across hot coals. It fades elegantly with a touch more of cinnamon and oak but without the bitterness perceived on the tongue.With Water It should go without saying that this whiskey demands some water. A few drops fail to tame the nose tickle (while bringing out some weird veggie notes like celery salt) nor the tongue burn. A much more aggressive watering (probably down to around 50%) yields a sour note – like apple cider vinegar – and reduces the nose tickle to a manageable level. The palate much muted reveals more cake-y notes with vanilla and buttercream. There’s still a great deal of oak.Overall A beast of a whiskey. Booker’s shows its best flavors and aromas while undiluted (except on the palate where you can only taste fire) and provides a sense of accomplishment that few whiskies can offer when conquered neat. That said one will be much more comfortable with a glass of Booker’s if a generous splash of water (or two) is used to tame it. Booker’s also shows off its strength (literally) in cocktails where the extra concentration stands up to bitters vermouth sugar and anything else you can throw at it.
67,Booker’s Small Batch Bourbon - For a bachelor party the other weekend in San Francisco our group found ourselves at Rickhouse. Rickhouse is supposed to be a go-to destination for bourbon in SF. Unfortunately for this whisky lover the very loud and very dark bar was revamping its whisky list. This is a conundrum when faced with a massive wall of completely unlit bottles of what I assume were whisky. Knowing about this blog some of my co-revelers asked me to pick a whiskey for them. So like any whiskyhead I flagged down the very apathetic bartender and started casting around for names that I knew would satisfy Pappy Van Winkle? Of course not. Ok. Maybe some scotch… Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or? All out. Oh. I needed a mid-level bourbon that they’d actually have in stock. Booker’s? $11 please. (Actually he told me $10 and then gave me change for $11. pfft.)Of course I forgot that Booker’s is always bottled at cask strength which almost knocked out my compatriots. They wanted water and ice to cool down their flaming palates. Mission failed. So much for Rickhouse and my credibility.Booker’s named after creator Booker Noe (Master Distiller for Jim Beam for 40 years) is bottled unfiltered and at cask strength in small batches after 6 – 8 years of age. Here are my notes for this fiery cask-strength Kentucky Straight Bourbon.Color Very dark even for a bourbon – mahogany.Nose Spicy rye and cinnamon accost the nose like red hot pokers of nutmeg and chai directly to my sinuses. You’ll want to approach this one carefully. Under the spice is a deep sea of woody caramel and fruit verging on red plum and cinnamon applesauce. Every note is big and bold and accompanied by a fiery nose burn that is more pummel than tickle.Palate Expected torrents of fire course across the tongue. When the burn (and the tears) subside one is left with a roiling sea of dark chocolate cedar chips applewood smoke burned simple syrup charcoal and unfathomable depths of woody corn sweetness and caramelized sugars.Finish Long and very astringent (drying). Cinnamon dominates oak tannin walnut skins and on the tail end marshmallow cream. Cries out for water.With Water After a liberal (and I have to admit somewhat vindictive) dilution with water I now get a bright piercing peach note on the nose clove maple sugar candies and I can actually get my nose in the glass. The palate though still fiery shows a neater more orderly array of bakery sweets nuts cereal sugars and wood sap. The finish might be somewhat more bitter and herbal with notes like rosemary and raw ginger coming to mind.Overall With or without water this is a big drink. While I’m relatively comfortable with the sipping of cask-strength whiskies neat something about the craggy mountain of flavor that is Booker’s was a big challenge for my nose and palate. The alcohol although mature is aggressive and untamed from the assault on my nose through the river of fire on my tongue until the tail end of the desiccating dryness of the finish. The usual characters are here in abundance cinnamon and nutmeg implied fruitiness (although not a clear cherry note like I find in other bourbons) charcoal heavy oak and sticky-sweet caramelized corn syrup. Do yourself a favor though and dilute this one heavily with water. Put some hair on your chest with a first sip neat if you must but you’ll likely burn out your palate if you drink an entire dram as-is. Also water seems to both tame and educate this beast revealing new notes and cleaning up the sloppy wildness of the original ones.
68,Boutique-y Whisky: Benrinnes (17 year) Batch 5 - Surprisingly I haven’t reviewed a whisky from Speyside distillery Benrinnes before. I had a nice independent bottle of Benrinnes that I enjoyed but never reviewed (I try not to bother reviewing already-sold-out store-exclusive bottles since there’s little point) so this is the first time I’ve formally analyzed a glass from this distillery.Benrinnes owned by John Dewar & Sons until it was sold to Diageo in 1997 is a storied Speyside distillery that was known for a complex form of partial-triple distillation (somewhat like Springbank) that was used between 1974 and 2007. It will be interesting to see when the post-2007 liquid comes of age if it is noticeably different. Most Benrinnes juice finds its way into blended whiskies (including some Compass Box releases) but a sherried single malt can be found in Diageo’s Flora and Fauna series and the distillate can also be found in the A.D. Rattray brand Stronachie which is made using Benrinnes whisky.This one a 17 year from That Boutique-y Whisky Company (TBWC) is the fifth batch of Benrinnes from the bottler. In fact they’ve just released a sixth batch of über expensive 26-year so I’m actually glad I got to try this (slightly) more affordable one. The 17 is bottled at 47.6% ABV which is fairly low for a cask-strength whisky implying a lot of loss to the angel’s share. There’s precious little info on the website or online so all I can do is guess that this is ex-bourbon (by the color) and the age tells us that this was partial-triple-distilled.— Self-Plagiarization Section —I was approached recently by That Boutique-y Whisky Company (TBWC) an awkwardly-named independent bottler owned by my former favorite UK retailer Master of Malt. (Former because after acquisition by spirits giant AB InBev they stopped shipping to the US for the foreseeable future.) Any long-time reader of this blog knows that a majority of my tasting samples come from 30ml Master of Malt Drinks by the Dram miniatures that I periodically order (and pay for) from the UK. Maybe they saw this and wanted to reward my slavish long-time loyalty. Maybe they missed all of my ranting after the AB InBev shipping debacle. Whatever the reason they asked if they could send me 5 tasting samples to review from their That Boutique-y Whiskey Company bottling arm. I agreed. I rarely turn down free whisky.Aside I DO turn down free whisky if it’s for a specific release that has a suggested retail much in excess of $150. Sometimes I’m weak. Sometimes I stand my ground. Either way I always give you my honest opinion even if I got my grubby paws on the whisky for free. Believe me or don’t really I don’t care.Note that That Boutique-y Whisky Company bottles are 500ml in the UK and other markets that allow that size. The few batches that reach the US are either 750ml or 375ml. Consider that when comparing prices from different retailers. A warning though if you can find it it’s probably around £67.95 per 500ml which works out to something like $130 US per 750ml. Ouch. A 375ml bottle (for $65 ish) would be a much more affordable way to taste this whisky. Look out for the new tariffs though which could add a chunk to the price…Thanks to Ros Frame at That Boutique-y Whisky Company Dram Club for the review sample!Nose Almost phenolic – a ghost of peat that isn’t there. Fresh laundry. Lavender flowers. Dry white wine. As it rests the florals evolve into rose honeysuckle and a host of flowers that I’m not qualified to name. The dram also picks up a bready or yeasty note a waxy citrus oil reminiscent of Clynelish  and something sweet like melting ice cream.Palate Syrupy body. Sweet at first! A surprise since the aroma was so dry. It doesn’t stay sweet for long definitely a hint of peat. Earthy but not quite fungal. Very low tongue burn considering the ABV. Rosewater white peppercorn.Finish Medium length. Slightly bitter with bitter aromatics like gentian (think cocktail bitters) and some charcoal. Not many of the aroma or palate notes make it through. Fades slowly but doesn’t evolve.With Water A few drops of water open up some citrus aromas – orange peel chiefly – and they make the palate softer and silkier in texture. There may be some new fruit notes – dried pear? But they are muddy and hard to decipher. Water optional.Overall This one is kind of all over the place. The peat notes are unexpected and they actually provide a nice earthy contrast to the typical light-and-airy Benrinnes style. Benrinnes does not use peated malt so I’m guessing that the process water must pick some up along the way. Unfortunately the aroma is the best part of this whisky – I wish those aromatics carried forward through the finish. I feel that the price is too high so I would be much happier to buy this in a 375ml format but not for any more than the UK-equivalent price of $65. Still 17 year-old single malt is not readily available in today’s market for less than $150 so I probably shouldn’t complain.
69,"Boutique-y Whisky: Irish Single Malt #1, Batch 4 - This one is a mystery single malt from an undisclosed Irish distillery. It’s aged 14 years bottled at 47.6% ABV and is the 4th batch from said distillery from That Boutique-y Whisky Company. It’s also so good that I’m going to try really hard to forgive the label.The Internet is fairly… maybe… kinda sure that it’s Bushmills.— Self-Plagiarization Section —I was approached recently by That Boutique-y Whisky Company (TBWC) an awkwardly-named independent bottler owned by my former favorite UK retailer Master of Malt.

A 375ml bottle (for $57 ish) would be a much more affordable way to taste this whisky.Thanks to Ros Frame at That Boutique-y Whisky Company Dram Club for the review sample!Nose Piercingly tart with a distinct pine sap note. Lemon peel juniper fresh berries pineapple granny smith apples and more that I just can’t pick up. It’s just… it’s a lot.Palate Thin body. Malt sweetness up front which is ambushed by a tart kiwi or maybe Cape Gooseberry note. Minimal tongue burn. Some bitterness appears on the palate – unusual – along with some typical Irish single malt flavors of hay semisweet malt fruit punch and caramel. Complex and just a little confusing.Finish Medium-short. Oh man that kiwi note is back and it’s delicious. It fades quickly replaced by (sorry) spent bubblegum and apple cider. This is soon replaced by a ghost of menthol.With Water A few drops of water amp up the kiwi note – YES! – and add a layer of sweet vanilla. The palate has a silkier texture and seems a bit more coherent. Finish unchanged. Definitely give it a go without water and then see how it changes when you add just a little.Overall Eclectic doesn’t begin to describe it. A fascinating (and lovely) aroma that spans pine sap to fresh berries is followed by an equally high-contrast set of flavors including that elusive and delectable kiwi notes that I’ve found in similar whiskies. The finish is just a little too short the only shortcoming. If this were available locally I would be very very tempted to pick up a bottle even at the *ahhem* elevated prices."
70,Boutique-y Whisky: Speyside #3 (8 year) Batch 1 - I had the privilege during the holidays to be invited to a Twitter tasting for That Boutique-y Whisky Company (TBWC) and was sent one of their Whisky Advent Calendars. (A 12-day calendar not the full month.) The perks of being a whisky blogger! Some people think it means free vacations to distilleries and events with lots of free booze. It doesn’t at least not for me. Still I’m very happy with the occasional free tasting samples.The calendar – which I’m still enjoying despite it being far past Christmas – had some nice gems in it. Even though Master of Malt is still not shipping to the US it is possible to get their Advent Calendars via other online retailers in the US. We only picked three of the drams from the calendar for the Twitter tasting which was a joyful chaos with no real conclusion except that we all agreed that interesting whisky was to be had in these Advent Calendars. It probably didn’t help that as one of the few ‘Yankees’ I was doing the tasting at 11 AM on a work day. At any rate I picked my favorite of the three and it was this one.An undisclosed Speyside distillery referred to only as “Speyside #3” this is an 8 year-old Speyside single malt bottled at 50.7% ABV. A fellow Twitterer… Tweeter?… suggested that it might be ex-bourbon Glenrothes. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again Nothing will teach you how little you really know about whisky than tasting blind or semi-blind. In hindsight it almost definitely is Glenrothes because the label shows several ghosts sharing a dram and one of the quirky traditions at Glenrothes is their “toast to the ghost”.Note that this whisky doesn’t seem to (yet) be available for purchase. Maybe for once (once!) I’ve managed to review a whisky BEFORE it’s released instead of after it’s all sold out. There’s a first time for everything…Nose Aroma is spicy! Star anise cardamom and a touch of spiced apple cider. A rest in the glass adds a layer of gooey caramel ginger tea and a touch of light brown sugar… reminds me of ‘blondie’ brownies.Palate Thin body with a robust tongue burn. Ouchies. 50% ABV is well represented. Already some mouth-drying tannins dark cocoa coffee grounds burnt caramel syrup and a dose of dry oak.Finish On the long side. Still spicy. Café latte scalded milk nutty in a slightly bitter way – bitter almonds. Pretty long and lingering.With Water This dram seems like it can handle some water. Aroma has fewer spices more nuts. Palate is much softer even with just a few drops. Chewy toffee. Otherwise the same.Overall Intriguing – it tastes like a candied café latte and the bitterness seems to come from that almost-burnt caramel rather than from oak. The bitterness is well-distributed and well-balanced so it doesn’t distract although I found the whole experience is a little too dry. Still it’s shockingly good at 8 years of age.This is one of the many good examples of the kind of excellent whisky that can be found via independent bottlers and yet another good example that whisky doesn’t have to be old to be good.
71,Boutique-y Whisky: Teaninich (11 year) Batch 2 - I remember wistfully three long long months ago back when it was possible to go out in public. I was instead sitting in this very chair doing an online Twitter whisky tasting with That Boutique-y Whisky Company. I still have a number of those samples left but one of my favorites of the samples we tasted was this Teaninich 11 year. I’m pretty sure I’ve never had Teaninich before so I didn’t have much to compare it to. However I really appreciate when a young scotch shows vibrancy and potency instead of paint thinner and malt liquor.A very pale single malt from an ex-bourbon cask and bottled at the potent but also very drinkable 47.9% ABV this Teaninich makes me want to go find other (cheaper) bottles from the distillery. Those will all have to be from independent bottlers as well as there are no official bottlings from this distillery aside from an occasional entry in Diageo’s Flora and Fauna series most of which doesn’t make it to US. Speaking of which this Boutique-y release appears to only be available in the UK.Nose Awesome green pear assorted florals honeysuckle etc. Someone in the Twitter tasting said lemonade. Yup. Candied pear drops.Palate A little banana up front with a nice even tongue burn not too hot at all. Just lets you know it’s there. Thin body but the flavor turns syrup-like quickly. Sweet and light fruit-forward but with a background of clean cereal grains. Pleasant. A rest in the glass adds more banana (banana cream pie?) and the body actually firms up becoming silky.Finish Creamy with vanilla and fresh dairy cream notes. A little kiwi maybe? Exits quickly but with no off-flavors and with minimal bitterness.With Water A few drops bring out a lot more cereal grains but they’re a little musty like wet hay. The water kills some of the fruit and thins the palate too. It does add a lot of sweetness – sugar cubes! – to the finish which is fun. Water optional.Overall Fresh and crisp. This would be forgettable at 40% ABV but here it’s nicely present and active. By color and flavor it’s clear this is from ex-bourbon likely a refill cask. It shows the raw expression of Teaninich which is cereal-driven but adorned with plenty of fresh vibrant green fruit. A fun dram and a great way to experience Teaninich if you haven’t before.
72,Boutique-y Whisky: Three Ships (6 year) Batch 1 - So I know that I usually do a scotch every other week and I tried. I did. But then I tasted this and had to tell you about it. Also I figured that a fitting first post-Tariff single malt review should be from a South African malt instead of a scotch.I was approached recently by That Boutique-y Whisky Company (TBWC) an awkwardly-named independent bottler owned by my former favorite UK retailer Master of Malt. (Former because after acquisition by spirits giant AB InBev they stopped shipping to the US for the foreseeable future.) Any long-time reader of this blog knows that a majority of my tasting samples come from 30ml Master of Malt Drinks by the Dram miniatures that I periodically order (and pay for) from the UK. Maybe they saw this and wanted to reward my slavish long-time loyalty. Maybe they missed all of my ranting after the AB InBev shipping debacle. Whatever the reason they asked if they could send me 5 tasting samples to review from their That Boutique-y Whiskey Company bottling arm. I agreed. I rarely turn down free whisky.Aside I DO turn down free whisky if it’s for a specific release that has a suggested retail much in excess of $150. Sometimes I’m weak. Sometimes I stand my ground. Either way I always give you my honest opinion even if I got my grubby paws on the whisky for free. Believe me or don’t really I don’t care.Three Ships is a single malt whisky from the James Sedgwick Distillery in Wellington South Africa made by master distiller and former cricket star Andy Watts. James Sedgwick is a shockingly old distillery in operation since 1886. It’s known for Three Ships as well as Bain’s Cape Mountain Whisky. This release (batch 1) from That Boutique-y Whisky Company – is the first ever independent bottling of Three Ships. The whisky was aged in American oak and then was filled into a Pedro Ximénez sherry butt(s) for a combined total of 6 years of age.Note that That Boutique-y Whisky Company bottles are 500ml in the UK and other markets that allow that size. The few batches that reach the US are either 750ml or 375ml. Consider that when comparing prices from different retailers. Also note that this whisky should not be subject to the recent US tariffs as it is not made in Scotland or Ireland. A warning though if you can find it it’s probably around £77.95 per 500ml which works out to something like $139 US per 750ml. Ouch.Thanks to Ros Frame at That Boutique-y Whisky Company Dram Club for the review sample!Nose Cured leather dark roast coffee beans dark cocoa nibs. Balsamic vinegar that’s so old the fruit has left the building and it has to be scraped out with a putty knife. A rest in the glass turns those cocoa nibs into honest-to-God dark chocolate. Dry but deep.Palate Thick syrupy body. The same notes from the aroma but OH MY GOD MY TONGUE IS ON FIRE. OK… Ok I’m Ok. I can’t taste anything but I’m Ok. Did I say the whisky is a little hot? More balsamico more chocolate. Maybe it’s the pain-induced delirium but this tastes just like Aztec hot chocolate with chili in it.Finish Long. Dusty cocoa continues through the finish. This stuff is the film noir version of single malt. Fades ultra-slowly with the chocolate notes slowly being replaced by mint. No bitterness.With Water More than a few drops of water somehow make the aroma drier. Dusty cocoa nibs Egyptian mummies etc. The palate is mercifully easier to handle (could be the water could be my dead taste buds from earlier). I highly recommend the water not because it adds any flavors (it doesn’t) but because it tames the tongue burn just a little.Overall Wowza. So Ok here you’re paying top dollar for something you just can’t get anywhere else. South African whisky that isn’t available in the US with a PX sherry finish at cask strength. That’s worth whatever the exchange rate currently sets it at. The chocolate notes are unreal and they are perfectly – I mean PERFECTLY – balanced with the remnants of super-old PX sherry left in this cask. The 53.7% ABV is serious business and is so concentrated I feel like I should be drinking it from an eyedropper instead of a Glencairn. I’m going to call this “Must Try” which is ridiculous because good freaking luck but it really is an experience if you see the opportunity.Note that it reminds me of Westland American Single Malt but the profile is different. Less “mountain man” more “ancient empty streets”. Aaaand now I have Bob Dylan in my head.
73,Boutique-y Whisky: Tomatin (11 year) Batch 4 - Oh I’ve had Tomatin before. It’s bland sweet banana-y. I’m sure this will be just another ho-hum sample that gets stuck in the back of my “tastings notes” folder and never sees the light of day. I’ve even tasted the 12-year. How much different can a batch of 11-year from That Boutique-y Whisky Company (TBWC) be? It’s not even sherried. At least I don’t think it’s sherried. The benighted TBWC website doesn’t even acknowledge the existence of this dram so all I know is what is printed on the label. Let’s see…A picture of tomatoes. For Tomatin. Hilarious guys just hilarious. 51% ABV OK good to know. And…? That’s it. Whatever this will never be published anyway. Tomatin is bland. Just as well too because this bottle doesn’t exist as far as the Internet is concerned. If for some crazy reason you wanted to buy it based on my review – hah! – you’d have to find a Boutique-y Advent Calendar that included a 30ml sample like the one I’m holding.Nose Huh. Interesting. Green banana odd florals (hops?) coconut water green tomatoes (damnit TBWC label!) and a dusting of sulfur that does not quite rise to the level of “rotten eggs”. An oddball and complex.Palate Medium bodied. Ample tongue burn as expected which resolves into raw cane sugar pineapple coconut and… I have no idea. Beeswax? No…Tomato compote? No… Sourdough? Maybe.Finish Medium-short. Now there’s a sulfury note that is almost meaty like turkey jerky which has replaced all of the tropical fruit notes and grassiness. Fades quickly alas. So damn weird.With Water Several drops of water add sweetness in the form of brown sugar and vanilla. Maybe milk chocolate too? Cocoa nibs at least. Water is interesting here. Try it first neat and then add a little water to see how it changes.Overall Whaaa… this was one of the hardest tastings notes to write in recent memory. The flavors and aromas are all over the place and don’t seem to fit neatly into existing scotch categories. It sounds like it should taste tropical or rummy from my choice of fruit descriptors but that’s totally not the overall impression. It’s as if someone took the makings for a frozen daiquiri and piled up all of the stem and skin and pith trimmings instead and let them ferment.Although hard to pin down this is an interesting tasty dram. An experience even. Despite the high ABV the complexity is very subtle and requires that you dig into the glass. I wouldn’t buy a full-sized bottle to drink myself but I would definitely call over scotch drinkers pour them a glass blind and demand that they explain it to me.This is the kind of dram that makes a whisky reviewer question his or her ability. “What am I even doing if I can’t figure out the names of these smells?!” Toss laptop through a window. Cry in a corner. /Scene.
74,Bowmore 10 “Devil’s Cask” - After last week’s review of Bowmore 15 ‘Darkest’ I was lucky enough to get to try the recently-released Bowmore 10 “Devil’s Cask” a cask-strength 56.9% ABV and non-chill-filtered (Yay!) 10 year-old Bowmore aged exclusively in ex-sherry casks unlike the 15 year which is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry. Color-wise this is darker than ‘Darkest’ (heh); it’s actually mahogany in color. There is no indication whether caramel coloring is added but I would say it’s likely (please correct me if I’m wrong!). You’ll pay a premium for this special release at retail $90 for a 10 year-old. The cask strength lack of chill-filtration and exclusive sherry aging take a bite out of the price though and only 1302 bottles will arrive in the US.The name relates to Bowmore village folklore concerning the Devil being trapped inside a round church (which has no corners for the Devil to hide in) and driven into a maturing barrel of whisky. Cute but ultimately we’re here for the flavor.Nose A dense regal marriage of dark reduced sherry sweet red fruits and sedate oily peat.Palate Thin bodied. Drying and intense as befits nearly 114 proof whisky. The flavor is slightly closed off but hides a bounty of dried dark berries balsamic and peat that tastes more like coal and liquid smoke than actual smoke.Finish Long lingering and subtle. Leather resin and furniture polish. The reduced dregs of a glass of old sherry. The smouldering embers of a fruitwood fire. On the tail end dark chocolate-covered dried berries.With Water Several drops of water really wake up the alcohol in the nose revealing more of that oily peat. They also serve to open up the palate letting out some sticky caramel and bold red wine.Overall This is totally unlike the ‘Darkest’ 15-year and in fact tastes much older and more concentrated. Instead of the wild fungal brashness of Darkest the flavors here are muted but sinewy slow-moving but powerful. The Devil’s Cask drinks like a much older sherry-monster that has given so much up to the angel’s share that it bottles out at a low cask-strength. That’s amazing considering both its youth and its high ABV. That justifies the price – if I tasted it blind I would swear up and down that this was 30 years old and 46% ABV. I could wish that the palate wasn’t so closed off – its one weakness.
75,Bowmore 12 - Bowmore is not a distillery that leaps to mind when discussing Islay. It should be. Although overshadowed by its mighty (both in flavor and in following) neighbors to the south Laphroaig Lagavulin and Ardbeg Bowmore’s whisky displays a restraint that can provide much-needed relief to the bog-soddened palates of peat lovers.Bowmore’s whisky is certainly peated and unmistakably Islay. However its notes tend towards smoke and lighter sugars instead of vegetal peat and seaweed. Its water traverses a 19-kilometer journey over all of the faces of Islay starting in limestone and sandstone hills on the east coast and then flowing over heather in the hills and peat in the bogs alike. Bowmore’s warehouse is located on the shores of stormy Loch Indaal rather than the Atlantic Ocean and 40% of its barley is malted on-site. All of these factors combine to yield a well-balanced not peat-dominated flavor profile. If peat explosions like Ardbeg are not your thing try a Bowmore.Nose Concentrated smoke hay coal dust cayenne pepper buttercream frosting.Palate Silky smooth and heavy bodied. Malty sweetness upfront developing into smouldering hay bales caramel and white sugar. The peat is well-integrated and refined – not “in your face” but still clearly Islay in character.Finish Long with typical Islay smoke and slightly bitter charred wood.Overall The thickness of the mouthfeel is excellent and the peat smoke notes are refined and well-rounded. Other notes are too subtle to detect on a first try but further exploration is warranted. Don’t add any water – it ruins the thick mouthfeel and reveals only a small amount of lemon and floral aroma. I have resolved to look deeper into Bowmore’s product line.
76,Bowmore 15 “Darkest” - Bowmore has a reputation (at least in my mind) for being the tag-along kid brother to the more serious Islay distilleries which produce much more heavily-peated malts. This is silly of course because Bowmore is one of the oldest and most venerable distilleries on Islay (and in fact in Scotland). The fact is that people like to talk about Ardbeg and its crazy special releases and over-the-top peat or Lagavulin and its rarity or Laphroaig and its intensity. They just don’t talk about Bowmore. They should.While my experience with the official 12-year was interesting but ultimately not energizing the ‘Darkest’ is another story. Named for the color instilled by a combination of bourbon and sherry aging followed by three years only in Oloroso sherry casks the 15 year-old malt is (to me) indistinguishable from its 12 year-old sibling. The sherry is funky in the extreme and the peat is murky and boggy in all of the ways that Ardbeg is not. You’ll pay for this effect – it’s around $70 – but I haven’t found anything quite like this on the market with the possible exception of craft distiller Lost Spirits and their oddball Ouroboros bottling. They both have a lot of the same funky resiny and composty flavors. If you like Darkest you should try Ouroboros and vice-versa. Also they aren’t kidding about ‘darkest’ – this stuff is downright dark. Not quite bourbon-colored but bourbon-esque.Unfortunately Bowmore 15 is both chill-filtered and caramel colored. I have a hard time letting caramel coloring pass when a whisky is NAMED for its color. For shame Bowmore! OK now I can focus on the flavor.Nose Wow. Plum sauce prune juice and resin. A thick fog of funky swampy peat and layers upon layers of fossilized aroma starting with the tar pits. The fruit is full-bodied but oxidized and with the peat comes across as a bubbling ferment of wild yeasty compost-y complexity. The aroma is varied and – while not quite muddy – is definitely confused. An intriguing experience. Note that a lengthy rest in the glass – more than 15 minutes – reveals a very intense meaty caramel note that is worth waiting for.Palate On the thin side. Lots of red-wine tannins and the initial flavors are of red grape skins and balsamic. Then the peat takes over and asserts itself over the sherry with flavor of seaweed mushroom and soil. Somewhat two-faced rather than an integrated whole.Finish Long. The fruit flavors freshen somewhat becoming very cranberry-like while the peat remains boggy and earthy. At no point does this make me think of ‘smoke’ although the unfortunate association (totally in my own head I assure you) of composting (rotting) fruit keeps occurring to me.With Water A few drops of water wake up a little fresh tart fruit. Cranberries again. The palate also is a little tart-er. The finish is more fully peated and the peat has more of a vegetal quality. A few drops (only!) aren’t a bad idea.Overall When you think about sherry and peat you generally think about Highland Park with its light tickle of citrusy Orkney peat and gently sweet fruity sherry. This is the opposite of both of those aspects. The sherry is resinous and funky the peat muddy and vegetative. The combination is alchemical though with an otherworldly fungalness… fungitude… fungality… funkiness that brings together the most edgy concentrated and dark flavors of both peat and sherry and becomes something greater than the parts. While not really an education in peat or in sherry it is an education in Darkest.
77,Bowmore Legend - Bowmore’s a tough one. One on hand you have one of the mildest of the Islay peaters often paling in comparison to the smokey salty powerhouses from the rest of the island. On the other you have a well-respected distillery producing highly-rated and critically-acclaimed whiskies. So far almost every Bowmore I’ve tried has resulted in basically the same review “Yeah it’s good… I guess.” Hardly thrilling prose. Thus it was with some trepidation that I approached this entry-level NAS bottling. Young (and cheap) peated malt tends to be rough and acrid and some people find such whisky undrinkable.There’s not much info available on Legend which tends to be the case with these low-end NAS expressions. It’s probably younger than 10 years on average bottled at the basement 40% ABV after spending time in ex-bourbon casks (no sherry unlike the 15-year “Darkest” and recent hit 10-year “Devil’s Cask”). That probably makes it a younger sibling to the slightly more expensive Small Batch… a Bowmore “Large Batch” if you will.Nose Well-balanced maritime smoke. Slightly citrusy (lemon) with a caramel malt core and medium levels of peat.Palate Soft mildly sweet malt. Mineral-flecked seawater and woodfire smoke.Finish Medium-long. Some charcoal and quickly-fading peat.With Water A few drops of water increase the apparent peat level and also bring more lemon oil and something floral – like lavender. The lemon repeats on the palate. Try a few drops of water but don’t dilute it too much.Overall This is not a malt for peat-freaks. This is a very well-balanced mildly peated dram for a very respectable price. Often younger cheaper Islay malts come across as brash acrid and bitter. Legend is the opposite of all of these gentle sweet and mildly smoky. It won’t win any awards for potency or complexity but it scratches the peat itch for under $30 a bottle and can also serve as a gentle introduction for peat newbies.
78,Bowmore Small Batch - I keep being impressed by Bowmore. While it certainly sits on the “mild” end of the peat spectrum among its peers on Islay Bowmore continues to release solid subtle well-rounded and expertly-crafted releases with very reasonable price points (Devil’s Cask excepted). The new permanent addition to the range Small Batch is positioned in between the NAS “Legend” and the standard 12-year. Aged only in first- and second-fill ex-bourbon casks and bottled at the slightly disappointing 40% ABV Small Batch scratches an itch at the $40 price point. When you want a little more subtlety than Laphroaig 10 a little more quality than Bowmore Legend and a little less sticker-shock than Ardbeg 10 or Lagavulin 16 Bowmore Small Batch is not a bad choice.I’m also happy to see another permanent addition to a core range during a time when $75 and up NAS limited editions seem to be all the rage.Nose Gentle peat flecked with refined honey and sweet cream. Banana cream pie toasted coconut and vanilla salt-water taffy. Light sweet but artfully presented and without any rough edges.Palate More of the same. Vanishing tongue burn followed by more coconut vanilla and lightly salty peat in turns. Elegant but light.Finish Of medium length with a bit more toasty oak roasted nuts and soft peat smoke. Ends with a touch of malt syrup.With Water A few drops of water seem to only add a caustic edge to the nose tickle and introduce a hint of wet hay. Unnecessary especially at 40% ABV.Overall While I could have done with a bit more robustness at 46% or so I applaud both the craftsmanship of this whisky and its sane price point. Clearly more well-rounded and well-integrated than the cheaper Legend it trades peat intensity for sweetness and subtlety. This would be an excellent “shallow end of the pool” introduction to peated whisky for scotch newbies (where Laphroaig 10 my first would be more like a slip and fall into the deep end).
79,Breaker Bourbon - Pro tip If you see the word “Inspired By” in the marketing blurb for a whiskey you can pretty much assume that entire paragraph is hogwash. The sourcing and selection of whiskey barrels on the secondary market and the subsequent aging blending finishing and bottling of those whiskies may indeed be an art but it is not like painting or sculpting. ‘Inspiration’ is thin stuff when the actual art form is taking disparate barrels and creating a balanced whole without breaking the bank. Standing on a rugged coast and watching the breakers crash on El Capitán beach may be an inspiring sight but it does not help you in your efforts to turn the most cost-effective barrels your tiny upstart distillery can get its hands on into something tasty enough to justify a $40 – $50 price tag.Breaker comes to us (by way of some place in Kentucky where they actually distill bourbon) from Santa Barbara county and the name and bottle labels are inspired by the wave ‘breakers’ on the nearby California central coast. That I can believe. I actually went to school (and did a little surfing badly) near that area and I will always have a special connection to that coast. That does not predispose me to like a bourbon “from” the area even if the company claims that the continued aging of (sourced) barrels in the local climate affects the whiskey spouting some nonsense from student scientists at Cal Poly (I went there I wasn’t qualified to say stuff like this then either) about high humidity rolling in from the Santa Rita hills aging the whiskey 4 times faster than Kentucky. See? Hogswash. The climate might have some effect but the climate of the California central coast is mild and mild climates require more time to mature whiskey than extreme climates (hot during the day cold at night) do. Just look at India. Note also that the company doesn’t say how long the whiskey ages in California. They could be buying white dog and maturing it for the whole 5 years in Santa Barbara (I doubt it) or they could be buying 3 year-old bourbon and giving it the extra 2 years by the beach. That’s more likely. Kentucky specifically requires any bourbon with “Kentucky” on the label be aged at least a year in the state of its birth.Two points of order One Ascendant Spirits previously sourced its bourbon for Breaker from MGP in Indiana. Now the bottle says “Distilled in Kentucky” so who knows where it’s made now or why the switch. Second the bottle does not say “Straight Bourbon” on it which is odd for a “craft” distillery especially one with an age statement on the label. Your guess is as good as mine but it may have something to do with the cross-country trip or perhaps an undisclosed addition of caramel color? Hmm.At any rate Breaker creates its small batches from actually small batches of 8 sourced barrels of high-rye bourbon each at least 5 years of age and bottles them at 45% ABV. The website is maddeningly short on details yet lush with photos. If that isn’t a metaphor for today’s whiskey industry then I don’t know what is. My bottle is from batch #25.Nose Piney like young rye. Basic corn-forward spirit – not too youthful – with a very mild but also pleasant pineapple note. Shy and a rest in the glass does not reveal additional aromas.Palate Syrupy/silky body with a moderate tongue burn. Quite sweet with elements of caramel nougat marshmallow and tropical fruit jam. Very nice with no rough edges. The texture is unusual and pleasant.Finish Of medium length. Mild tannins with leftover tartness from the tropical fruits. Suddenly shy again fades with only a hint of charcoal bitterness.With Water A few drops of water do the worst possible thing they wash out what little aroma there was! The palate and finish seem unchanged except for a slight bump in the already-sufficient level of sweetness. Avoid water with this one and maybe only use it in cocktails where you want the whiskey to take a back seat.Overall This might be damning with faint praise but the whisky has no off notes and nothing objectionable in its makeup. The aroma has a nice (and rare) pineapple note but is otherwise shy to the point of boredom. The palate is on the sweet side but without any challenging aspects (charcoal tannins heavy wood etc.) and aside from the typical tongue burn is quite easy to drink with a very nice silky (oh God I’m going to say it… smooth) mouthfeel. The finish is similar to the aroma in its reticence.If you like your bourbon sweet and unchallenging then this isn’t a bad choice although I balk at paying $40 (and especially $50) for a bourbon unless it’s exceptional. This is… just fine and it has nothing to do with the climate in the Santa Rita hills. I suggest buying your pleasant 5 year-old sourced juice elsewhere and for less.
80,Breaking & Entering Bourbon - I continue to be uneducated about bourbon. I’ve now had a few good ones (I very much enjoyed Angel’s Envy and Pappy Van Winkle 15 year-old really opened my eyes) but I still taste a much narrower range of flavors in bourbon than I get from single-malt scotch. There’s always a lot of wood a big hit of corn syrup (the cheaper the bourbon the more “plastic” the corn syrup tastes) a smattering of spices and often a background of cherry.St. George Spirits up in Alameda CA (across the bay from San Francisco about an hour from where I live) which has an excellent single-malt American whiskey and a range of other spirits has just recently released Breaking & Entering Bourbon Whiskey. The interesting thing about this bottling is that it’s actually a blend of bourbons sourced from other distillers. They bought 80 barrels from a number of different distilleries although they’re not saying how many or which ones. Oh and it’s only $35. Here’s what I thoughtNose Big and cedary. Everything about the aroma is deep deep dark wood deep corn sugar deep charcoal that verges on wood smoke. The aroma is denser and more robust than one would expect at this ABV. The nose is mostly corn and cereal sugars without much fruit. Perhaps a background of cherry pie filling and dried figs.Palate Chewy. A bit much on the moonshiney burn upfront but that dissipates quickly leaving a well-balanced mix of sweet corn that deep dark resiny oak and a bit of nuttiness. Marzipan caramel apple cider bitter almond skins and pervasive charcoal.Finish Smoky. Lots of charcoal notes remain in the mouth plus a bit of red apple skin molasses and a spoonful of dark roasted chocolate nibs.Overall Far more dynanic than similarly-priced bourbons. St. George shows an adept hand with blending and a clever choice of source material which yields a big bold multi-layered blended bourbon. A pleasure to drink and a fabulous value.With Water A few drops brings a nose full of toffee. A few piney accents and a lighter maple sugar candy note. In the mouth while thinner it’s a bit more sophisticated. The finish maintains its sweetness but the water accentuates the bitter notes. Try it both ways but I really like it with a bit of water.
81,Broken Barrel Cask Strength Bourbon - A few times I year I start thinking about refining my approach to this blog. First I think “Maybe I should only review age-stated whiskies.” This idea is quickly quashed when I remember that would shut the door on favorites like Aberlour a’bunadh Ardbeg Corryvreckan etc. My next thought is “Maybe I should only review producers that make their own whisky.” This takes some thinking…I could avoid something like 80% of the bottles in the American whiskey section at the store for instance. Talk about a taking a load off of my mind. Almost all of these are LDI/MGP spirit anyway so I’ve been essentially reviewing the same damn whiskey over and over again for years. But then I’d miss out on some gems like Sagamore Spirit Rye and Angel’s Envy and frankly I’d probably run out of stuff to review.So here we are today once again taking a look at a well-marketed bourbon without the faintest clue as to where the liquid is actually distilled. At least Infuse Spirits makers of the Broken Barrel brand as well as a slew of – hah – infused spirits is trying to do something innovative. They are doing something similar to what John Glaser of Compass Box wanted to do with the original Spice Tree. He wanted to mature whiskey with oak staves inserted into the barrel but the Scottish trade organization (SWA) stopped him. Since the rules in the US are looser nobody is stopping Infuse from dropping various staves into their tanks of already-aged bourbon. So when my quarterly Flaviar Subscription bottle choice came up I picked a bottle of the Broken Barrel Cask Strength Bourbon.A quick aside – I experimented several times with “home aging” kits that involved inserting sticks of various kinds of oak into small bottles of whisky. The results were mixed but my conclusion for each product was that it wasn’t worth the time money or effort. That said there’s a huge difference in scale between a 250ml bottle with a 4-inch oak stick in it versus an entire steel tank with whole staves inside. It’s no surprise to me that the results differ.So on to the whiskey. We have Kentucky Bourbon from a mash bill of 70% corn 21% rye and 9% malted barley. Neither the age nor the original distiller are published although it does say a “minimum of one year in new charred oak”. It does not say “straight bourbon” on the bottle… perhaps the use of staves prevents the legal use of ‘straight bourbon’ or perhaps they didn’t want to wait the full 2 years of aging. This sourced bourbon is then ‘matured’ an extra period of time in large stainless steel tanks with various oak staves from other barrels dumped inside. Here’s the cool part Each bottle lists an “oak bill” describing the percentage of each kind of oak used in the tank. My batch (Batch 006) has 40% ex-bourbon staves 40% new French oak staves and 20% staves from a sherry cask (probably sherry “seasoned“). The website does not say how many staves are used nor does it say how long the whiskey spends in the tank.This is a review of the Cask Strength bourbon which is bottled at 58% ABV but Broken Barrel also sells a 95 proof bourbon a rye and a “California Oak” bourbon with Cabernet wine cask staves.Lastly and this is irrelevant to the review but I had to mention it The bottle has a convenient little leather strap around the neck which makes it SO EASY to pour into a glass. I now wish every bottle had one of these.Nose Strong nose tickle. Piercing notes of spicy ground cinnamon dried cherries and butterscotch. Oaky with resinous notes of aged lumber sap and varnish. Fairly dry on the nose – not much sweetness.Palate Silky body. Robust tongue burn which hits immediately. Spicy with significant rye spice notes of clove cinnamon star anise and maraschino cherry. The sweetness of the corn finally comes through with a fudgy kind of caramel-and-marshmallow (scotchmallow?) thing.Finish Medium-long and tannic. A reprise of the aroma notes – dry woods and spices. Evolves a bit of candy corn (honey / corn syrup) and dry cocoa powder before fading.With Water Several drops of water initially mute the aroma necessitating a rest in the glass. The water adds a good amount of much-needed caramel sweetness and a delectable vanilla buttercream note. The palate burn is also reduced. I HIGHLY recommend adding water to this.Overall This is not a bad cask-strength bourbon. It’s a little on the dry side but the sweetness does peek through in places where it’s needed for balance. I can’t detect anything specifically different as a result of the added staves although there is a slight sandalwood-and-chocolate note that I associate with French oak. It is definitely heavily influenced by the rye with spice-cabinet notes dominating.This is also priced very well $40 is not unreasonable for a tasty cask-strength bourbon. Some of the more “craft” American whiskies have started asking upwards of $70 for the same thing. Recognize though that you’re paying partially for gimmick. There are plenty of cask-strength bourbons available from the big produces for less. Still I’m very happy with this one and would consider buying a second bottle and I’m now pretty curious about the one with Cabernet staves…
82,Bruichladdich – The Classic Laddie - Recently I was invited to take part in a marketing campaign for Bruichladdich’s Octomore 11 series which went well enough that Bruichladdich asked me to work on the sequel A discussion of Bruichladdich’s Transparency Campaign “No Hidden Measures”. While that piece of work was sponsored the following blog post was not and although I received the review bottle for free (perks!) my review below is my own and was not influenced by (or published in) the campaign. The credibility of any reviewer is besmirched when they take industry money but we can’t all be pure as the driven snow like Ralfy so I leave it up to my readers to decide if my words are trustworthy or not. (Please don’t leave me…)When I tried the first release of The Laddie Ten back in (oh God) 2013 I was thoroughly underwhelmed. I don’t know if the distillery was still getting their feet under them after the massive rejuvenation effort (it was after all whisky distilled a scant year and a half after unbarring the gates and rebuilding the equipment) or if my palate just didn’t agree with the Bruichladdich house character. It must have been the former because every Bruichladdich I’ve tasted since – granted that number is 5 – has been light fruity and floral just like it says on the tin. I like subtlety in scotch and Bruichladdich has become very good at it.The Classic Laddie is a vatting of barrels of unpeated Bruichladdich distilled from 100% Scottish barley and aged in well all sorts of things. Head Distiller Adam Hannett has a generic house character in mind when he tastes casks for the vatting but does not worship at the feet of the gods of Consistency like most distilleries. You can and should expect some variation between batches even if the overall theme is the same. The Classic is vatted from casks as young as 5 or 6 and as old as 12 or 13 and while they are mostly ex-bourbon Adam often uses wine-finished casks to achieve the balance of flavors he’s looking for. Check out my discussion of the “No Hidden Measures” campaign (the sponsored one) so you can see exactly what went into my bottle which is from batch 20/109. It’s got some virgin oak some sherry some Cab Merlot and Mourvedre casks and some of the barley was grown on Islay. The youngest casks (the majority) were 7 years old. Cool.The vatting once complete is bottled at 50% ABV without added coloring or chill filtration. The higher ABV helps those subtle notes pop and as we know from Octomore Bruichladdich spirit likes to be braced by a high alcohol percentage.Nose Lightly fruity with orchard fruits (white peach crisp plum yellow apples) golden raisins and raw honey. Assorted florals – honeysuckle and rose primarily – with an undercurrent of light nutty grain-forward malt. A tinge of youth brings both vibrancy and a swath of chemical aromas (not quite acetone). Nose tickle is mild despite the fairly high ABV and there is a nice balance between sweetness and airiness. A rest in the glass reveals even more fruit.Palate Viscous but not quite syrupy body. A moderate tongue burn – consistent with 50% ABV – is followed by unctuous dripping honey peach jelly buttered scones and more golden raisins. On subsequent tastes the red wine elements are a little clearer – redder fruits and jammy port wine. Very tasty.Finish Medium long. Delicately sweet with only a balancing spot of charcoal bitterness. Evolves through light fruits – dried – nondescript florals and then fades with a note that I can only describe as peach gummy rings.With Water A few drops of water add a creamy marshmallow and vanilla note which fade quickly after a rest in the glass. The water doesn’t seem to have much effect otherwise. Proofing it down a few more % releases a banana and kiwi note but makes the palate bland. Water optional with this one.Overall I love the combination of peach golden raisin clear crisp malt and honey. There’s exactly the right amount of sweetness just enough bitterness to give it contrast and a few lovely high notes stuck here and there including that amazing peach gummy flavor. My only complaint is that the vibrancy of young malt is attended by that acetone/paint thinner note although it’s only present on the aroma. A few of those ex-bourbon casks (likely the refill ones) in the vatting could really have used another couple of years of maturing to polish that off. I look forward to trying a different batch to see what changes.The price feels right even for an NAS entry-level bottle. Its higher-than-baseline price feels different to me now that I know what goes into the vatting and because Bruichladdich does a lot of things the expensive not-efficient way like the better craft distilleries. That comes at a premium. Still try to seek out one of the retailers listing this for $50 or less. $60 is a bit of a stretch.
83,Bruichladdich (10 year) – The Laddie Ten - I really really wanted to like Bruichladdich’s first official standard bottling after its re-opening and re-vitalization in 2001 by Mark Reynier and Jim McEwan. After a mad flurry of special releases most sourced from the maturing stock left by the previous owners in questionable wood Bruichladdich was finally producing its own whisky. With barley grown in Scotland (some of it organic some of it from heirloom ‘Bere’ barley) distilled and aged under Jim McEwan’s watchful eye in ex-bourbon barrels and bottled at a laudable 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring it was bound to make a big splash. It ticks all of the boxes for me independent ownership responsible quality-minded production craft presentation and all with medium levels of peat to better showcase the character of the spirit and the quality of the wood. I really wanted to like it.I didn’t.Sometimes I hazard a reviewer’s own tastes get in the way of objectively evaluating a product. While many people might love The Laddie Ten and be joyous at its statement to the industry at large – that quality can be mightier than efficiency – I just can’t get over the bitter notes that overwhelm the palate and finish. This is actually my second negative tasting of The Laddie Ten but the first (at WhiskyFest) I dismissed as palate fatigue. I would love to hear in the comments from readers who tasted and enjoyed The Laddie Ten. It should be noted that my sample was poured from a bottle produced before the July 2012 sale of Bruichladdich to conglomerate Rémy Cointreau the news of which rocked the spirits business and saddened the hearts of craft whisky lovers everywhere. The blame for my experience must lie in my taste buds alone and not in Reynier or Rémy. Don’t let my rating dissuade you – seek it out taste and let me know what you think!(Update Here’s a review of The Classic Laddie the NAS entry-level malt from Bruichladdich.)Nose Restrained peat – mossy and herbal. This is peat that wafts but doesn’t punch you in the face. Beneath the peat lurks honey lozenges pear drops and lemon custard. A nice well-integrated if snoozy set of aromas.Palate Somewhat nutty. A little bit on the dry side. Unexpected amount of bitter barrel tannins up front with a tinge of acrid smoke and wholly absent fruit.Finish Lightly smoky but the bitter barrel influence continues. Charcoal menthol and honey. Fades with some herbal notes.With Water Several drops of water brings some florals to the nose – reminding me of peated Balvenie. The water doesn’t improve the rest of the experience for me however.Overall The nose on this one is impressive with very well-integrated fruits and middling amounts of elegant peat. However this all falls apart on the palate for me with disjointed notes of bitter wood and acrid smoke. The finish appears short and while it delivers on the peat aftertaste there is little else to recommend it. Some people are very into this release but I have been wholly underwhelmed at both tastings. Ah well perhaps my sensitivity to bitter tastes has doomed this release for me.
84,Bruichladdich Octomore 10 year (4th edition) - This is the third part of a three-part series on Bruichladdich’s Octomore 11 release. For my review of 11.1 which includes all the background click here.For the fourth time Bruichladdich has included a 10 year-old version of Octomore along with the annual release. The first time was in 2012 the second in 2016 and the third in 2018. Each has represented a unique spin on Octomore and this year’s focus is on virgin oak.Virgin oak is uncommon in scotch whisky. While it’s used extensively (indeed it’s required by law) in bourbon and other American whiskies the climate of Scottish dunnage warehouses does not favor long (10 15 20 years) aging in virgin oak. The whiskies become too bitter too tannic and too overpoweringly flavored by the oak. Still when handled carefully and used in moderation virgin oak can bring unexpected flavors of cinnamon and baking spices sandalwood and tropical fruits that aren’t otherwise found when using only refill casks. Compass Box has used this fact to great effect and other Scottish distillers sometimes dabble in it. Here it forms a small part of the vatting along with greater amounts of ex-bourbon (1st and 2nd fill) American oak casks from Jim Beam Heaven Hill Buffalo Trace and Jack Daniels.The idea behind the 10 year-old editions of Octomore is for Bruichladdich to examine the effects of longer aging on the somewhat-well-understood young (typically 5 year-old) Octomore. As Head Distiller Adam Hannett said in our interview session for the Octomore 11 campaign “we just don’t know everything” and “there are so many infinite variables in the creation of single malt whisky so we try to isolate one variable at a time to see how it improves the whisky or doesn’t.”The fourth edition of Octomore 10 year-old was distilled in 2009 from the 2008 harvest of 100% Scottish grown Optic barley. The barley was malted by Bairds in Inverness to 208 ppm before shipping to Bruichladdich for distillation. After aging for 10 years it was bottled in a limited 12000 bottles at 54.3% ABV without chill filtration or added coloring. Although it is cask strength Bruichladdich mixes in a “just a drop” of spring water from Octomore Farm’s natural spring.My tasting sample was provided by Bruichladdich for “The Octomore 11” Campaign.Nose Um. Wow. Fragrant. A ton of lemon verbena white tea honeysuckle and orange peel plus a ghost of peat infusing all of it with smoke that reminds me more of Chinese tea-smoking than peat. The whole is also sweeter than 11.1 with a lot more brown sugar and a little oak resin. Lovely. This release is also more stable – it appears unchanged after a rest in the glass.Palate Medium bodied. A robust (but not blinding) tongue burn is followed by burnt salted caramel mild earthy peat and sweet malty barley with just enough wood to remind you that it’s been aged longer.Finish Long. The peat rolls in like a storm front. Dark heavy woodsmoke-style peat with a some of the dark chocolate notes from Octomore 11.3. Not bitter. Finishes with a sudden wisp of black licorice and mint.With Water Several drops of water wake up an odd pomegranate note (like fresh grenadine) and also bring back some of the fleeting floral notes from the original pour. The palate is a little fruitier as is the finish and the licorice note arrives earlier. Definitely try this without water first and then add a little after it starts to languish in the glass.Overall This is definitely my favorite of the three Octomores that I got to taste. That said I did miss some of those youthful bright citrus notes that were prevalent in Octomore 11.1. If I had all the money in the world I would own a bottle of each.
85,Bruichladdich Octomore 11.1 - In September I was invited to take part in a marketing campaign for Bruichladdich’s Octomore 11 series which is slated for retail release 10/1/2020. I was to meet with 10 other whisky “influencers” (ugh) and bloggers now “The Octomore 11” to collaborate on an owner’s manual of sorts for Octomore. I maintain that I do not consider myself an influencer but I wasn’t going to turn down the opportunity to taste Octomore 11 for free and get paid for doing some writing. We had two Zoom sessions because who hasn’t had enough of Zoom lately and we got to ask questions of brand ambassador Raymond Tibbs and Head Distiller Adam Hannett. I was assigned to pair up with Jeff Schwartz The Whiskey Fellow to write a history of the Bruichladdich distillery. While that piece of work was sponsored the following blog posts were not and although I received the review samples for free (perks!) my reviews below are my own and were not influenced by (or published in) the campaign. Or maybe I’m now solidly an industry shill. It’s the Internet in 2020 nothing’s real anymore.Octomore for those who haven’t had the pleasure of shelling out $150+ for a bottle of one of the past ten editions is the most heavily-peated whisky in the world. It’s bottled at cask strength and comes out every year (ish) in either 3 or 4 varieties. In brief 11.1 is 5 years old and is always aged only in ex-bourbon American oak. 11.2 is for the travel retail market (but can also be had online) and this year it was partially matured in ex-Pauillac wine casks and then finished in St. Julien wine casks (total age 5 years old). 11.3 is 5 years old and is always made exclusively from locally-grown Concerto barley from Islay’s Octomore farm. There is no 11.4 this year but there is a fourth edition of the Octomore 10 year-old which is aged for 10 years in a combination of virgin oak casks and ex-bourbon American oak casks. All of them are super heavily peated cask strength (or nearly) and are bottled without chill filtration or added coloring.The story of Octomore is that when the newly-resurrected Bruichladdich was elbowed out of their malt supply at Diageo’s Port Ellen maltings (which didn’t want to handle their low-volume orders) whisky industry legend Jim McEwan sourced peated malt from Bairds Maltings in Inverness. While visiting he discovered that Bairds was doing their malting the old-fashioned way using a giant open-air outdoor peat fire. Modern maltings don’t do this because it’s extremely variable. One windy day during the drying process will cause the peat levels to plummet and no matter what the weather the final product is often way over the requested ppm (parts per million) peat levels requested by the distilleries who as we all know love their consistency. To combat this variability Bairds blends the heavily-peated barley with unpeated malt to hit the numbers specified by his customers. Jim asked whether anyone was distilling the uncut stuff and was told that nobody would want to do that because it would be undrinkable. Anyone who has ever met Jim knows that could only be taken as a challenge. Instead of the 40 ppm malt he went there to buy (for the Port Charlotte brand Bruichladdich’s peated line) he came home with 131 ppm. Luckily Bruichladdich’s stills are unusually tall and narrow and this causes the resulting spirit to be very light — all of the heavier phenols that we associate with “heavily peated” whisky fail to climb that high and never make it into the heart cut. So while it’s true that 80 – 300 ppm malt would be undrinkable from anyone else’s stills from the stills at Bruichladdich it comes out downright elegant and fruity. All Jim had to do was mature it just long enough in oak to mellow the alcohols and then bottle it at cask strength (later he started mixing in just a little of Octomore Farm’s crystal clear spring water) and Octomore was born.11.1 this year was distilled in 2014 from the 2013 harvest of Scottish-grown (not on Islay) Concerto and Propino barley. The barley was malted by Bairds in Inverness to 139.6 ppm and the final 30000 bottles were bottled at 59.4% ABV. The release was aged for 5 years in ex-bourbon American oak casks from a variety of bourbon distilleries namely Jim Beam Heaven Hill Buffalo Trace and Jack Daniels. Although it is cask strength Bruichladdich mixes in a “just a drop” of spring water from Octomore Farm’s natural spring.Nose A first whiff reveals cool clean citrus-flecked smoke. While the nose tickle is robust enough to keep my nose from going too deep in the glass the aroma is clearly peated but in an understated crisp streamlined kind of way. There’s also sea breeze lemon and lime zests shortbread biscuits and pale but fragrant malt. After a brief rest (and carefully venturing deeper into the glass) I find grapefruit more lemon-lime soda and subtle floral notes. The peat is present but decidedly in the background. Definitely allow the glass to sit and develop as it changes over time.Palate Lightly syrupy body. A blinding tongue burn as expected clears quickly to repeat a lot of the aroma notes especially the lime and grapefuit. The peat is in the form of earthy campfire with crackling pine needles but again is in the background.Finish Very long. Now the peat takes over. Waves of mouth-drying earthy woodsmoke with vague bitter herbal notes – aloe? – continue through the finish fading slowly along with a final flash of grapefuit.With Water The addition of quite a few drops of water instantly release a delicate rosewater note that was not there before along with a suggestion of green banana. The palate is a little livelier but no less powerful. It might also be slightly sweeter. I don’t notice any change on the finish. I highly recommend trying this without water first – brave it! – and then with water to see how it changes for you.Overall An experience. Octomore sears the mouth but relents and delivers on that light floral fruity spirit that Bruichladdich is so proud of. The peat is heavy on the finish but never overbearing – you feel like you get your money’s worth without being punched in the face with it. There’s peat but there’s also room for delicate citrus and florals. Every true whisky lover should probably experience Octomore at least once in their lives even if they don’t spring for a full bottle of it.I should point out that despite being “only” 5 years old this whisky never tastes young or immature. There’s never a hint of acetone or vodka or raw anything. It doesn’t have the wood sugars or weight of oak that comes with longer maturation true but it never tastes or smells unfinished or incomplete.
86,Bruichladdich Octomore 11.3 - This is the second part of a three-part series on Bruichladdich’s Octomore 11 release. For my review of 11.1 which includes all the background click here.The Octomore x.3 releases are always made from 100% Islay barley from Octomore Farm grown by “The Godfather of Soil” James Brown. This year’s 11.3 release is 5 years old and was aged in ex-bourbon American oak casks from a variety of bourbon distilleries namely Jim Beam Heaven Hill Buffalo Trace and Jack Daniels. It was distilled in 2014 from the 2013 crop of Concerto barley grown on Octomore Farm which was first shipped to Bairds Maltings in Inverness to malt it to 194 ppm. After aging 11.3’s limited run of 18000 bottles were bottled at 61.7% ABV without chill filtration or added coloring. Although it is cask strength Bruichladdich mixes in a “just a drop” of spring water from Octomore Farm’s natural spring.While researching for the Octomore 11 campaign I made a point to watch the 2018 documentary Scotch A Golden Dream (I found it on Amazon but it’s probably available elsewhere) because it heavily features Bruichladdich. In it Jim McEwan talks about the soil of Islay and why he goes to such cost-inefficient lengths to get 100% Islay barley. He talks about how mainland Scottish farms can pull 3 or 3.5 tons of barley per acre in yield while Islay’s difficult climate maxes out around 2 tons. Moreover he talks about how the rain and spray from the rough seas nearby puts brine directly into the soil. This not only contributes to Islay peat’s characteristic oceanic flavors it also affects the barley that grows in the soil there. As he says in the film “How does that salty flavor manifest itself in the whisky? Barley grown on Islay has a fantastic fresh citrus lemon and honey flavor. The smell is just fantastic… just evocative of Islay.”My favorite story from doing the research for the Octomore 11 campaign was the description of Ileach farmer James Brown escorting the first delivery of his Islay-grown barley through the gates of Bruichladdich distillery by marching in front of the truck in full Scottish regalia – kilt and all – playing the bagpipes. You can’t make this stuff up.My tasting sample was provided by Bruichladdich for “The Octomore 11” Campaign.Nose Wow – so immediately different from Octomore 11.1. There’s a strong spicy raw ginger and gingersnap cookie aroma that greets the nose first followed by green grass. As with 11.1 the nose tickle is powerful so be careful about going too deep in the glass. After a rest in the glass (do this!) a bouquet of floral notes arrive along with creamy vanilla custard. There seems to be far less citrus (or any fruit) than the 11.1. The peat is also very muted although it is present in the form of wet earth.Palate Syrupy body. After a white-hot searing tongue burn there is black pepper pickled ginger brown bread and sweet barley.Finish Long. The peat now comes rolling in but still not as strong as expected. The peat is dark and earthy and not very smoky. The ginger and black pepper persist and now there’s an aroma of rich dark earth and extra-dark chocolate. Not bitter. Note that on subsequent sips the peat seems to build up and then starts to deliver the more classic Islay peat flavors you’d expect. On the tail end a surprising note of roasted coffee bean.With Water Several drops of water seem to tease out a thread of lime zest that was missing but otherwise don’t appear to have any effect on the aroma. The palate is a little crisper with more evident (mostly citrus) fruit. The peat on the finish is also more evident but it’s also more bitter. This dram seems to benefit from the addition of a little water.Overall In previous editions I preferred the x.3 for its vibrancy and clear conveyance of barley. This time the grapefuit notes in the 11.1 won me over versus the somewhat muddled chocolate-and-earth notes in 11.3. The peat was also clearer crisper and better-integrated in 11.1. It’s good… really good… but if you’re only going to get one edition this year get the 11.1. Unless of course you can afford the 10 year…
87,Buffalo Trace Bourbon - Any long-term reader of this blog will know that I’m always on the hunt for bourbon that brings truth to the “bourbon is good value” adage. So far I’ve mostly found that bourbon is cheaper than single-malt scotch and tastes like it. It’s usually too sweet too rough or too plastic-tasting for me – often conjuring what I call “High-Fructose Corn Syrup” flavors or more accurately the flavor of cheap synthetic candy. When I do find a good bourbon it’s impossible to acquire just as expensive as single-malt or not available in my state.Buffalo Trace a stalwart in the big bourbon game has also become known as the purveyor of the best limited-edition bourbon in the country. The Buffalo Trace Antique Collection or BTAC is an annual Easter Egg hunt for allocated bottles that mostly end up selling via raffle just like Pappy Van Winkle bourbon which is also now made by Buffalo Trace.Buffalo Trace’s parent company Sazerac is the largest distilling company in the United States and makes a dizzying array of liquor including the Barton brand of bourbons Sazerac Rye (duh) Eagle Rare Blanton’s Bourbon E.H. Taylor Stagg A. Smith Bowman Regan’s Orange Bitters Peychaud’s Bitters Caribou Crossing Fireball “Whisky” 99 Bananas Rain Vodka Corazon Tequila Highland Mist and a slew of other liquor products.Buffalo Trace’s namesake bourbon is bottled at 45% ABV and comes from a low-rye mash bill (probably only 10% rye to 90% corn) which is also used to make the Eagle Rare and Stagg bourbons. Despite its low rye content Buffalo Trace is pretty close to my ideal flavor profile. It’s slightly spicy slightly woody and not too sweet. This makes it good for sipping on the rocks or in cocktails. However I should point out that the bourbon-based cocktails that have really made me sit up and pay attention are usually made with higher-proof bourbon of at least 50% ABV. That relegates Buffalo Trace (despite its sip-ability) to the everyday cocktail ingredient shelf. Its price and flavor profile however make it my current house bourbon and unlikely to be supplanted any time soon. It’s pretty hard to beat the combination of bottom-shelf price mid-shelf quality and top-shelf balance.Nose Compared to some bourbons the nose is wood-forward and tannic – almost vinegary – with sweet caramel notes in the background. Hazelnuts and almonds turning to vanilla after a few moments of rest in the glass. Dusty spices mild charcoal dry cornmeal.Palate Slightly tart soon turning malty with marshmallow and cocoa nibs. Not cloyingly sweet but with a fine balance of wood sugar and tartness.Finish Warming and of medium length. A reprise of the aroma predominantly nut skins and smoldering charcoal. Fading with vanilla bean and cinnamon.With Water A few drops of water awaken a familiar “candy corn” note that luckily isn’t too plastic/fake/corn syrupy. On the palate it retains its flavor but pops a little more. I highly recommend a little water with this one and you shouldn’t feel bad about dropping in an ice cube once in awhile either.Overall I like a bourbon that doesn’t make your eyes water with sweetness but also doesn’t go fully grassy (like Jim Beam). Buffalo Trace is probably the most well-balanced bourbon I’ve had in this price range and happens to strike my personal preferences in bourbon. It makes a mean Old Fashioned too of course. This will continue to be my house bourbon for the forseeable future.As much as a bourbon Old Fashioned had been bypassed by the craft cocktail scene of late (and then suddenly became wildly popular again but now… you know… it’s “craft”) something about sitting back with an inoffensive… Ok I’ll say it… smooth bourbon over ice with bitters and sugar makes me feel like a Southern gentleman in a white suit rocking away the afternoon on my front porch. Somehow I look like the KFC Colonel in this vignette… but you get the idea. Also there’s nothing simpler than assembling an Old Fashioned when you can’t be bothered to break out the shaker or strainer.
88,Bulleit Bourbon - So I really do try not to be too hard on inexpensive bottom-shelf whiskies. I recognize that many of them are intended for mixing into cocktails or at least on ice – not for drinking neat with a focus on flavor. That being said this blog is devoted to the discovery of (relatively) inexpensive ‘brown spirits’ worth imbibing neat. I feel that if I dismiss a dozen $20 whiskies as “Not Recommended” (whatever flak I may get in the comments) in order to find one $20 whisk(e)y that stands out and may find a place in my regular cabinet rotation then I have done a good deed. Of course I have a lot of work left to do There are a dizzying array of brands and products available. So let’s get started with a Bourbon that I’ve been hearing good things about. Bulleit.Bulleit (not ‘Bullet’ – it’s named after Augustus Bulleit who created the first recipe in 1830) is owned by Diageo and distilled at the Kirin company’s plant in Lawrenceburg Kentucky. Kirin’s Four Roses Bourbon brand is made at the same facility. (Note According to bourbon expert Chuck Cowdery this is probably no longer true.) Bulleit is characterized by a higher-than-usual percentage of rye (28% according to Wikipedia) and a maturation of around six years which is long for an American whiskey. Bulleit also has a straight rye on the market.Nose High-fructose corn syrup. The alcohol fumes have a turpentine quality. Deep in there are some brighter notes like fresh raspberry and cotton candy. A dash of water seems paradoxically to heighten the nose tickle – a first for me.Palate The attack is very warming – you can taste that extra proof. Once it settles in on the tongue there is a nice oakiness plenty of vanilla and a continuation of those processed corn syrup notes. The body is medium with a nice heft to it. Water does not improve.Finish Lots of oak tannins and a wave of vanilla. Pretty long. Fades out with the tannins turning a little bitter.Tasty in its way and (I would hazard) better than some cheaper bourbons. However with those fake corn syrup flavors – almost reminiscent of aspartane or other non-sugar sweeteners – I can’t say I would ever be in the mood for it. This is unfortunate as the longer aging and higher percentage of rye in the mashbill had sounded like a good combination for me (I like rye and I’ve always thought American whiskey was underaged). Oh well – on to the next one!A further note on my ratings If I rate a whiskey like this – which is generally well-thought-of – as “Not Recommended” I am not discouraging the purchase of this product. I am telling you that I do not recommend this whiskey for drinking neat. I imagine it would make a fabulous Manhattan.
89,Bulleit Bourbon (10 year) - I wasn’t terribly impressed by the entry-level (no age statement) Bulleit Bourbon. Luckily I got a chance to try the 10 year-old bottling. Both bourbons are made from a mashbill of 68% corn 28% rye and 4% malted barley (for enzymes). At more than twice the price of its NAS sibling the 10-year is essentially the same juice but aged for a full 10 years in charred white American oak barrels and bottled at a very slightly higher 91.2 proof (45.6% ABV).But where is Bulleit distilled? There is no Bulleit Distillery (yet see below) and never has been. For years until 2014 Diageo confirmed publicly that all of the bourbon that went into Bulleit was distilled at Four Roses (and presumably aged elsewhere). A rumor combined with Diageo’s sudden refusal to answer questions on the matter has lead renowned bourbon blogger Chuck Cowdery to conclude that Diageo is now getting some or all of its Bulleit bourbon from elsewhere. It’s generally thought that Diageo ages Bulleit at the warehouses at the Stitzel-Weller facility which it owns. Still since we’re talking about new-make here you can assume that any bottle of 10-year sold until 2022 was made at Four Roses.In 2014 Diageo announced that it was building a Bulleit distillery in Shelby County Kentucky. The new distillery is expected to begin putting out spirit in 2016. Soon Diageo won’t be only a NDP (non-distiller producer) of bourbon anymore!Nose Soft woody caramel pine sap furniture polish and a hint of maple syrup. Quite dry… with a sawdust quality.Palate Not too hot on the entry. Thin-ish body. Piney eucalyptus charcoal nut skins root beer. Still dry but with a better balance than the aroma.Finish Charcoal pervades with the attendant bitter oaky tannins but the balance is nice and there’s just enough fading sweetness to keep it so.With Water A little water perks up the nose adding rock candy and candied pecans complete with cinnamon. On the palate it’s a little more vibrant and a bit of maraschino cherry has crept in around the edges. I highly recommend a bit of water.Overall Like its younger sibling Bulleit tastes like its marketing materials describe it – a rough-and-ready frontier whisky. It doesn’t pander with sugary candy notes but gives you the oak and the alcohol up front and doesn’t much waver from that formula. The extra age has not markedly sweetened mellowed or concentrated the bourbon… but has removed many of the ‘acetone’ notes and given it a little softness around the edges and a little better balance on the finish. This presents a conundrum. At $25 the NAS Bulleit is underaged and suitable only for cocktails. At $50 the Bulleit 10 is eminently drinkable neat and makes very nice cocktails but you could get both of those qualities in something that’s $40 or less. I can’t recommend that you suffer through the $25 version or that you spring for the $50 version. That makes this “Try Before You Buy” since hey maybe this is the bourbon flavor profile you’ve been searching for. Can’t hurt to try it.
90,Bulleit Rye - Bulleit (not ‘Bullet’ – it’s named after Augustus Bulleit a historical figure that Diageo may or may not have embellished as there is little to no historical information about him although his descendant Tom Bulleit now oversees the company) is owned by scotch giant Diageo and distilled at the MGP of Indiana distillery where nearly every other rye on the market today is also distilled including Templeton Rye Redemption Rye Willet Rye (until they start releasing whisky from their new KBD plant) High West (at least they blend it skillfully) George Dickel Rye (also owned by Diageo) Angel’s Envy Rye (at least they finish it in rum barrels) and a host of other small-time brands that have not come clean about their origins. Bulleit uses MGP’s 95% rye (and 5% malted barley used for its enzymes to jumpstart fermentation) recipe. Bulleit Rye is purportedly aged between 4 and 7 years and is bottled by Diageo at 45% ABV.Diageo also sells a bourbon under the Bulleit brand which previously was distilled at the Four Roses distillery but is likely now sourced from elsewhere.Nose Pungent! Caraway seed menthol eucalyptus cinnamon (stale) black pepper (fresh) and a hint of cherry.Palate Thin body. A little fiery and rough around the edges in a “frontier” style. Cinnamon red-hots pine sap cinnamon toast (without the raisins). Somewhat dry (not particularly sweet). A little bit vegetal or grassy.Finish Medium-long. Some sweetness emerges in the form of cinnamon saltwater taffy. The pine/eucalyptus is muted now and the finish is primarily oaky with a slight bitterness. A ghost of apple skins completes the finish.With Water Several drops of water wake up a nice citrus note (like orange bitters or grapefruit) in the aroma without compromising the integrity of the flavor. I recommend a few drops of water. Also this bodes well for Bulleit’s ability to stand up to ice or mixers.Overall A very respectable rye. I like finding those piney/eucalyptus notes in younger ryes and Bulleit has those in addition to some of the spicy/oaky flavors present in older ryes. I still prefer Rittenhouse 100 for its elegance and polish but for a rough-and-ready robust rye that will shine through in mixed drinks but can also stand up to a glass of ice (or a glass of nothing else) it’s hard to beat Bulleit. It may be distilled by MGP but Bulleit is doing something right because this is quite good for the ~$25 price tag.
91,"Bunnahabhain (12 year) (New 46.3% Presentation) - I’m generally in favor of Scotch producers embracing current trends in craft whisky higher proof bottlings avoiding chill-filtering and ditching the spirit caramel for coloring. It’s also generally a good thing when a producer revitalizes a languishing expression with a new recipe or an updated maturation technique.That said I’m not crazy about Bunnahabhain’s updated 12 year-old expression. I wrote here about the older 40% bottling (green bottle) and while unobtrusive and unassuming it had a certain charm. The new muscular 46.3% ABV bottling is brash bitter and relies heavily on wood char for flavor. I’m disappointed but kudos to Bunna for trying something new and embracing the craft aspects of whiskymaking. The new bottling is in a redesigned brown bottle and is a touch more expensive than the older one.Nose Woah what’s going on here? There’s some big wood in here it smells musty and smoky almost as if it were peated. Mushroomy and nutty with a bourbony lacquer note. A little more acetone than I normally like. Angular and muscular this is not delicate and subtle like the 40% Bunna. A dash of water doesn’t seem to have much effect on the nose.Palate Nice thick mouthfeel oily. Upfront the palate is dark and brooding – overcooked caramel burned-out logs and some slightly bitter char. Later there are some sweet roasted nuts pecans and chestnuts. A hearty dash of water brings some mellower fudge and spice cookie notes.Finish Medium length. Oaky but soft and thankfully not too bitter. The flavors all seem to be darkened by soot and charred wood start to finish just stopping short of acrid. The water sweetens the finish.Overall I was expecting old-style Bunna but better. Instead this seems a little overcooked to me like grandma’s pecan pie was in the oven a few hours too long. The barrel char is deep and overrepresented the sweetness is minimal and overshadowed. For once I wish Bunna were peated to provide a counterpoint in flavor. A pity. A hearty dash of water goes a long way toward repairing the damage. I recommend the water with this one for sure.Note I gave this one a “Mediocre” rating although it’s really not a bad whisky. This just reflects my disappointment in the rough unapproachable new style. I just couldn’t bring myself to “Recommend” it but don’t let me stop you from trying it.
"
92,"Bunnahabhain (12 year) (Old Presentation) - Bunnahabhain is currently re-introducing their 12-year expression with a new (dark brown) bottle and label. They are also increasing the bottling strength from 40% ABV to 46.3% ABV and switching to non-chill-filtering. The price is also increasing by $5-$10. I’ve heard it has a little more sherry influence and a touch of smoke and is altogether more interesting than the older bottlings (pre-2011 with a green bottle). See my review here of the new style. My notes below are for the original 12-year (the green bottle).I tasted the 12-year single malt recently at C.B. Hannegan’s in Los Gatos CA. Funny story My brother-in-law Louis and I were sampling drams together and I ordered this Bunna. When it arrived I was trying to identify the nutty sweet cooked aroma in the nose. Baked bread? No sweeter… cinnamon rolls? No there’s no cinnamon or nutmeg… Louis took a whiff and joined in guessing cookies or walnuts. Suddenly and simultaneously the answer occurred to us both and we exclaimed “Aunt Nancy’s Pecan Pie! Yes!” Whisky sampling is always more fun in good company!Nose If you’re expecting peat from this Islay malt you will be very confused Heavy oak – like newly-lacquered furniture cherry vanilla. Wait… Pecan pie!!! This smells exactly like my aunt Nancy’s Thanksgiving pecan pie!Palate Unlike any Islay I’ve had – lots of caramel and vanilla full body almost no smoke or earthiness at all. Salted caramels. Finish Unfortunately short mostly with oak tannins and furniture polish.Conclusion This is a good middle-of-the-road dram mostly notable for its diversion from traditional Islay peat character. Worth a try although there are better non-peated non-sherried malts (Speyside Lowlands) in this price range. Keep an eye out for the new (brown bottle) 12 year – that’s definitely worth a try.

93,Bushmills (10 year) Single-Malt Irish Whiskey - Bushmills is an odd duck. One of the few remaining historical Irish distilleries (in fact the oldest licensed distillery in the world) Bushmills makes single-malt and blends it with grain whiskey in the Scottish style. Bushmills distills its malt and buys its grain whiskey from Midleton (makers of Jameson among others). Thus Bushmills is one of the few distilleries that sells both single-malt whiskey AND blended whiskey with the same brand name. See my review of Bushmills Original Blended Whiskey here and Black Bush blend here.Like many Scottish distilleries Bushmills ages its malt whiskey in a variety of casks. The 10-year is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-oloroso sherry casks (mostly ex-bourbon). Also like a few Scottish distilleries Bushmills triple-distills its malt leading to the characteristic Irish “light” flavor and body.A note about the value proposition with this one I was unable to nail down an average price with stores right down the street from each other (here in Northern California) selling Bushmills 10 for $49 and $27 respectively. In my review below I indicate that you can do much better with $49 which is true but if you can find it for under $30 it’s a reasonable value dram and my “Not Recommended” rating should be ignored.Nose Sharp nose somewhat acidic (lemony). Some mild tropical fruit notes – green banana kiwi coconut – and a slight industrial edge like Redbreast but less pleasant. Not much depth.Palate Syrupy body with tons of fresh coconut meat. A downright Piña Colada at first. The flavors fade on the tongue leaving only that industrial grime note.Finish On the short side. Remnants of coconut oil charcoal and something chemical – like glue. Not bitter exactly but the aftertaste is off-putting.With Water The addition of water freshens the tropical fruit notes on the nose (which had seemed to fade in the glass) adding perhaps an indistinct floral note or two. Otherwise it is unchanged.Overall For nearly $50 I highly do not recommend this. It is run-of-the-mill in terms of unique flavors and very shallow. It has a few Redbreast-like qualities but without Redbreast’s depth of flavor and intensity. Any oloroso barrels involved in the maturation do not seem to have had an effect on the final product. You would be far far better spending your money on Redbreast 12 or The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 or even Glenlivet 15 or Glenfiddich 15.
94,"Bushmills Black Bush Blended Irish Whiskey - Black Bush surprised me. I expected the usual response that entrenched businesses (blended whisky) have to perceived threats (innovation in craft whisky) pale imitation. Instead I found a very drinkable very accomplished very well-balanced approach to a sherried blend. The fruit notes that you expect in a package that mixes extraordinarily well with both cocktail ingredients and ice. Oh and it’s damn cheap.I actually keep coming back to the bottle of Black Bush that I bought on a whim. At first for cocktail fodder and then for something to splash into a glass of ice. I even bought a second bottle (rare for me).Black Bush is according to Bushmills a blend of 80% malt whiskey to 20% grain whiskey a particularly high percentage of malt for a blend under $40. The whiskey is aged “up to” 7 years in a combination of oloroso sherry casks and ex-bourbon casks. The result is obviously sherry-influenced but not overly sweet or fruity. It’s bottled at 40% ABV. Note that Black Bush was previously aged more in the neighborhood of 11 years and has since lost some of that maturity probably as of the most recent bottling revamp. Really though it’s still quite good for the price.
 
Nose A gentle sherry presence greets the nose – with fresh apple cider young fruity red wine and champagne grapes. A hint of cereal grains and bakery goods like scones but not overly sweet.Palate Mild and thin. A bit of grape jelly and more non-sweet baked goods… English muffins? Otherwise same notes as on the nose. A bit sweeter on the tongue – with more caramel than anticipated. A hint of acetone but only a hint.Finish Medium-long. The grain is more present here with a bite of young medicinal grain alcohol but that passes quickly and the finish fades pleasantly with grape skins and red wine tannins.With Water A splash of water wakes up more fruit notes with red currants unripe figs and dried cranberries. However it makes the palate dreadfully thin and watery. At 40% ABV this hardly requires watering. Note that while Black Bush makes quite nice cocktails and is excellent on the rocks it does suffer a little from melting ice. Try a large ice cube or a straight-up cocktail rather than something with a lot of water.Overall Black Bush is probably the most successful inexpensive blended whisky on the market that I’ve had with the sole exception of Bank Note which wins only because it has a lot more round caramel and stands up to mixing better. I vastly prefer Black Bush to Bushmills Original Bushmills 10 year-old single malt and any other blended Irish whiskey that I’ve had including the similar Concannon aged in red wine casks. If you haven’t settled on an Irish Whiskey for your “everyday” dram or cocktail cabinet yet give this one a serious look."
95,Bushmills Original Blended Irish Whiskey - In my (misguided?) quest to try every inexpensive whisk(e)y (under $100 or so) I have to admit that my approach isn’t quite fair. A sip of Macallan 12 – a dram made to drink neat – cannot be qualitatively compared to a drop of Johnnie Walker Red Label which is unabashedly made to be mixed. That’s not to say that the two categories cannot cross over – some very fine whisky cocktails can be made with high-end scotch and some ‘mixable’ blends can be quite enjoyable au naturel. I leave it to the reader to take my reviews then with a grain of salt. I’m no expert on mixology and thus am not qualified to review these products based on the results of mixing them. In fact I rarely drink whiskey cocktails. This then is a review of Bushmills Original solely for the purpose of drinking neat.This is a blended Irish whiskey which in the case of Bushmills means a mixture of triple-distilled Bushmills Irish single malt whiskey with column-still Irish grain whiskey. Unlike brands like Jameson and Powers which combine single pot-still whiskey with their grain Bushmills uses single-malt. It’s not that simple though. In a quest to extract the lightest possible spirit during malt distillation the distillate is circulated through the series of stills several times – some of it much more than three times – with the excess from very narrow cuts being returned to the still again and again. The malt is then aged largely in first-fill ex-bourbon American oak barrels.Of course to achieve mass-market quantities and mixable price-points the malt is diluted with a pretty standard column-distilled grain whiskey and bottled at 40% ABV. As with any low-priced blend you expect the lightness and “mixability” (a euphemism for blandness in my book) to take a higher priority than quality. If you’re interested in Irish single malt take a look at the line of Irish single-malt from Bushmills which is definitely intended for drinking straight.Nose Black pepper faint dried coconut. Asphalt. Charcoal. Oatmeal.Palate Mildly creamy body with more black pepper up front and a suggestion of marshmallow. Pleasant cereal flavors on the tongue without any depth at all.Finish Some brown sugar and oats on the finish. Very short.Overall This isn’t awful. It’s a simple single-note dram with no complexity but not as faulty as others at this price point. The black pepper on the nose is interesting and the raw grain whiskey doesn’t announce itself on the tongue like other competitors do. While it doesn’t have the brash racy flavor of Jameson it wins in smoothness and simplicity. Still I would not buy a bottle of this for the purpose of drinking it neat and would rather spend the extra $10 to $20 on some inexpensive sipping whisky (starting with the lower-end single malt scotches).
96,Canadian Club 100% Rye - Not to be outdone by Crown Royal Canadian Club has released a Canadian rye whisky that focuses on the rye grain which is typically a rather secondary ingredient in mass-market Canadian whisky (the first being corn)… an ironic situation considering that Canadian whisky is colloquially referred to as “rye”. Perhaps in an effort to rekindle the association between Canada and that characterful grain or more likely to compete with Crown Royal’s runaway success Northern Harvest Rye Canadian Club has one-upped their adversary by using 100% rye in the mash bill as opposed to Northern Harvest’s 90-ish percent.Canadian Club 100% rye is distilled by Alberta Distillers like one of my favorite Canadian whiskies Alberta Rye Dark Batch although the Canadian Club brand is owned by Beam-Suntory. The 100% rye whisky is aged in a combination of casks brand new American white oak barrels previously-used bourbon barrels and barrels that previously held Canadian whisky. The resulting batches are bottled at 40% ABV.Note that this is not to be confused with the Canadian Club Chairman’s Select [actually it is the same – see comments] which is also 100% rye nor Alberta’s own Alberta Premium also 100% rye.Nose Very soft nonthreatening grain with a sweet envelope of vanilla bubblegum and honeysuckle. This auspicious start is marred by a flash of acetone (nail polish remover) betraying its youth. Palate Soft supple and creamy body. Quite a bit hotter than I’d expect at 40% ABV. The palate offers more sweet grains and a teasing of jammy fruits but not much else.Finish Short. Vanilla sweet and floral with more honeysuckle and some orange blossom. Pleasant and not bitter but quick.With Water Water might bring a little bit of caramel to the palate rounding out the sweet flavors and taming a little of the tongue burn but is otherwise unhelpful. If you don’t like this at first sip throw in some water to see if it improves.Overall To me this feels like an attempt to compete with Crown’s Northern Harvest Rye which falls flat. Its initially sweet fruity aroma is undone by youthful raw alcohol and paint-thinner notes. Its creamy body (a hallmark of Canadian blended ryes) is otherwise bland and overly hot. In a word forgettable.
97,Caol Ila (12 year) - Caol Ila long owned by Diageo (from back when it was DCL) and long used as fodder for blending because of its subdued peatiness and round nutty undertones has in the last decade won more recognition as a single malt. The distillery itself rebuilt in 1974 to crank out whisky for blending has the largest capacity of any distillery on Islay. While considered to be milder in peat flavor than its contemporaries (Ardbeg Lagavulin and Laphroaig) its malted barley (from the maltings at Port Ellen) is the same as the 35ppm peated malt used by Lagavulin. Caol Ila’s quiet nature must be derived from some element of its process of distillation some characteristic of its stills or perhaps from the minerality of its water.Caol Ila is a component in Bell’s Johnnie Walker (especially in Double Black) and other Diageo blends. It’s interesting to note that Caol Ila switches to production of unpeated malt for part of the year (sometimes released as a single malt as well) which is also a component in Diageo’s blends. Caol Ila is shipped via tanker to the Scottish mainland filled into ex-bourbon barrels and aged in a Diageo warehouse. 95% of its production goes into blends. There is also a peated 18-year expression.Nose Wet bog a dominant peatiness that seems more like wet leaves humus and decaying fallen trees than smoke or sea. Very light oakiness underneath with only a thin layer of malt serving as a vehicle for the peat. Caol Ila has a reputation for being one of the “lightest” examples of Islay peat but I would say that the peat here is simply less brash and smokey. There’s no denying that the dominant note here is peat.Palate Soft in texture but with a lot of tongue burn for 43% ABV. The peat is subdued on the palate revealing instead waves of chocolatey malt and a bit of nutty oak.Finish Medium-Long. The peat becomes almost fruity with a hint of strawberry jam. Chocolate fudge and hazelnut butter. Tasty.With Water A few drops of water make the peat more pungent but don’t affect its character. The water might tame the tongue burn somewhat. It certainly doesn’t hurt.Overall The nose is a little off-putting for me even though I enjoy peat. The muddiness and earthy quality of the peat seems “lower quality” to me than the peat of other Islay distilleries. However that all changes on the tongue where the peat gives way to a very tasty chocolate note. This continues through the finish which has the strangest merging of boggy peat strawberry jam and chocolate fudge. Weird but very satisfying. I would score this higher if the nose were either more clear and refined or less peaty. Either way the rest of the experience makes up for it.
98,Caol Ila (18 year) - Long-time reader Jamie was kind enough to send me another sample this time from his recent purchase of a bottle of Caol Ila 18 year (purchased in 2019). I was very happy with his previous sample an Unpeated Caol Ila 18 from 2017 so we both thought it would be interesting to see how the “standard” peated 18-year compares. My joy at receiving this sample (and the previous one) is compounded by the fact that this whisky is inexplicably unavailable in the United States (there is a 750ml version but the distribution is so small that all retailers appear to be continually out of stock).Most of Caol Ila’s output is peated and most of it (95%!) ends up in various blends as it’s the go-to standard for adding smoke to blended malts these days because of its inherent softness and willingness to play with others. This being a Diageo malt there is essentially no information online. It’s clearly been aged in ex-bourbon casks for its 18 years of maturation but were they refill casks? First-fill? Who knows. I’d guess refill. Was the whisky chill-filtered or did it receive coloring agents? No idea. And onward we proceed as uninformed as we beganNose Smoke-forward vanilla-laden Caol Ila peat like a fragrant just-snuffed candle. Sandalwood blanched almonds and butterscotch pudding. Downright elegant.Palate Medium-weight almost oily mouthfeel. Sweet upfront (more pudding) with a sedate tongue burn. Sweet wood pungent peat smoke with herbal notes.Finish Long. Caramel or nougat charcoal bitter herbs (like cocktail bitters) that linger for basically ever along with the remaining wisps of smoke.With Water The addition of a few drops of water seems to initially mute the aroma requiring a rest in the glass. After the aroma seems unchanged by the water. The palate might be thinner and offers slightly more tongue burn. The water adds a menthol note to the finish. I suggest skipping the water with this one.Overall 18 years in oak has not seemed to dull the Caol Ila peat like it does in other Islay malts. That same vanilla-laden peat smoke is accompanied by a greater amount of wood sugars and caramelly (it’s a real word damn you spellcheck) notes than younger Caol Ilas and they meld harmoniously. That sandalwood note on the aroma the vanilla throughout and the oily mouthfeel are highlights. I could wish for the finish to have a little less of that bitter herb flavor but it is really a problem easily solved by taking another sip. I could also wish for a push higher in ABV as 43% is a little lackluster for an 18 year-old release. That said the price is not outrageous. Depending on exchange rates it can be had for around $90 to $100 which is what we all USED to pay for 18 year-old single malt scotches.For the record I did like the unpeated Caol Ila 18 better. It probably helped that the unpeated release was at cask strength. Still if you’re a fan of smoke but prefer it to be presented in an elegant package without taking the top of your head off Caol Ila 18 delivers on all fronts.
99,Caol Ila (18 year) Unpeated – (Special Release 2017) - I don’t get to drink a lot of Caol Ila. To me it sits in an awkward place in the scotch whiskey pantheon not as heavily or intensely peated as its neighbors Laphroaig or Ardbeg and used in higher proportion than other peated malts for various blends (especially the Diageo blends) it feels like the “middle child” of the Islay drams. When I’m in the mood for peat I usually don’t feel like going halfway and I turn to something intense like Ardbeg Corryvreckan or Lagavulin 16 or Laphroaig 10. Caol Ila just doesn’t spring to mind.Luckily for me a longtime reader of this blog Jamie offered to send me a sample of his newly-acquired Caol Ila Unpeated 18-year. I’m always up for a chance to try something new without having to purchase a whole bottle! The “Unpeated Style” releases from an annual run of unpeated Caol Ila made by the distillery for blending purposes are a Special Release series bottled by Diageo once a year often at different ages and always at natural cask strength. The 2017 release is the oldest bottled to date at 18 years in (ex-bourbon) refill American oak hogsheads. There is no added color and the whisky was not chill-filtered.I find this kind of expression to be a valuable learning opportunity if you remove a familiar aspect (the peat) from a familiar dram tasting the differences teaches the mind and the tongue how to identify and appreciate those aspects and allows one to understand how that flavor fits into the whole. You can also sometimes uncover beautiful notes that were otherwise masked by (in this case) the peat. (Here’s a review of the regular peated Caol Ila 18 year.)Nose A flurry of fruit (tropical in nature mango kiwi passion fruit) which settles after a rest in the glass into a sedate lemon-lime affair flecked with vanilla and a well-rounded custardy sweetness. A twinge of smoke – not peat! – and delicate florals add interest. Despite the high ABV the nose tickle is under control.Palate Syrupy body. Oaky upfront with a sultry layer of mossy (but not smoky) peat. The tongue burn is fierce and numbing but is accompanied by a fiery note of cinnamon and stonefruit – plum? This subsides into a typical banana-and-vanilla ex-bourbon flavor profile with a pleasant earthy note like freshly-dug garden soil.Finish Medium-long. Faint licorice some oaky spices (including the cinnamon) and a large helping of somewhat bitter charcoal which obscures the rest of the finish the only mar in an otherwise excellent dram. Fades with a ghost of menthol.With Water A splash of water adds a tutti-frutti or bubble gum note to the aroma and melds the fruits into a cohesive sweet dessert-like package. The water thins the body somewhat and does very little to tame the tongue burn. I think you’d have to aggressively water it down to achieve that. The finish is a little brighter and sweeter – again with the bubble gum. I suggest at least smelling a dram at full-strength before adding any water. Progressively add small amounts of water – allowing each time to meld – until the tongue burn is acceptable to you.Overall Do I lose my blogger cred if I say I like this better than the peated version? Do I have any blogger cred? This has a phenomenal whirl of fruit a bit of sweetness a bit of smoke and robust texture and flavor. I could wish for a little less bitterness on the finish but the entirety is well worth the price tag (and the experiment of leaving the peat out of a peated classic). It goes well with a splash or two of water. Either way this is a contemplative multi-layered dram which completely does not make me miss the peat.I’m marking this as a “Must Try” to recognize its quality and to encourage any fans of Islay malts (and Caol Ila in particular) to experience what lies underneath all the smoke.
100,"Caol Ila Moch - Caol Ila is a funny animal. It is one of the few distilleries – at least one of the few heavily-peated malts – that I can think of that is almost equally valued by blenders and single malt aficionados. The older and special edition bottlings of Caol Ila accrue much attention while nearly every popular peated blend contains at least some Caol Ila. Most Caol Ila bottled as a single malt lies on the milder end of the peat spectrum (as opposed to heavy-hitters like Ardbeg and Laphroaig) but it’s definitely a fully peated single malt and uses the same malted barley (from the maltings at Port Ellen) as the 35ppm peated malt used by Lagavulin.Caol Ila is shipped via tanker to the Scottish mainland filled into ex-bourbon barrels and aged in a Diageo warehouse. This could (might maybe possibly) account for its less-briny presentation than island neighbor Laphroaig. 95% of Caol Ila’s production goes into blends.Moch meaning “Dawn” is an attempt by Caol Ila to justify the industry-wide practice of NAS (no age statement) bottling by marketing it as the “first” single malt from the distillery where barrel selection was done by taste instead of by age or other factors. Putting aside the fact that you’d think taste would be of primary importance to barrel selection for every product it just so happens that going by taste alone leads Caol Ila’s blenders to choose substantially cheaper 8 year-old barrels instead of 12 year-old barrels. Convenient that. Part of my levity is facetious most NAS is comprised of younger malt and some of it benefits from that fact. Still I’d expect Moch to be substantially cheaper on the shelf than the more-expensive-to-produce Caol Ila 12 year but that doesn’t appear to be the case. Both retail around $50-$60 depending on where you’re getting your deals although the 12 year seems to sport a $5-$10 premium. I’d gladly lay down 10 ducats for an extra 50% time in the barrel but maybe I’m getting ahead of myself.Turns out Moch is only available in European markets so thanks to a generous reader for providing me with a sample!Nose Meaty Caol Ila peat wafts from the bottle as soon as it’s opened. Potent ocean-flecked smoky peat dominates. An undercurrent of vanilla and light honey balances the peat perfectly.Palate Thin body. Sweet at first but the sweetness recedes and peat – now a little ashy – pervades. Bitter barrel char earthy almost-fungal peat a hint of tobacco leaf and campfire smoke are the main flavors.Finish Long. Many of the flavors drop away leaving wood smoke and a tingle of menthol and a dollop of black licorice.With Water A few drops of water initially mute the aroma. Give it some time in the glass. Even after it comes back though the water doesn’t seem to add anything. I wouldn’t suggest water with this dram.Overall I mean it’s definitely Caol Ila. The youth comes through in some slightly-too-ashy and slightly-too-vegetal notes here and there but I’ve always thought that peated drams benefit from a little youth. Still I drink this and can’t help but miss some of the more polished elements of the older 12 year. If this were substantially cheaper than the 12 year I could call it a good value… but it seems the prices are similar.I’m calling this a Try Before Buy because if you have a choice between the 12-year and this for similar prices I’d always go for the 12 year. If you find a good deal though there is definitely peaty goodness in this bottle. It’s also a good candidate for an “introduction to peat” if you will as it’s somewhat lighter than other peated bottlings. Also truth be told sometimes I’m in the mood for a gentler level of peat. You don’t always want to be beat over the head with the peat-stick.

101,Cardhu (12 year) - Color Pale YellowNose Apricot and orange-blossom honey honeydew melon and green apple lemon sorbet. Some green grass and little hints of Vinho Verde. A few drops of water opens up some heather and other flowers.Body Thin legs thin body. A little creaminess which a few drops of water sadly breaks up.Palate Comes on with the nicest hazelnut gelato which fades into apricot jelly lemonade cantaloupe and a little frosted breakfast cereal.Finish Medium length and the oak comes on finally with undertones of vanilla and a final fading ghost of lemon curd and grapefruit. Refreshing. I might be crazy but I think a few drops of water actually extend the finish lingering with lemon drop candies lime peel and malted milk.Those Spaniards know what they’re talking about a lovely dram – very gentle. Bright and sweet without being cloying in the least. With so many fruits it’s like drinking a summer fruit punch with vanilla ice cream floating in it. Yum. Try it with and without the water.
102,Chieftain’s: Mortlach (18 year) 1997 – 2015 - Chieftain’s Rare Single Malt Scotch Whiskies is the independent bottling arm of Ian McCleod Distillers storied blenders bottlers and now owners of the Glengoyne and Tamdhu distilleries. The company wisely saw the slow demise of the independent bottling industry as distilleries started hoarding their own surplus barrels to meet escalating demand across the world and bought two single malt distilleries a very smart diversification.There is still independent whisky to be bottled even if the pickings are slimmer and some tempting things show up on shelves. Here a Mortlach (one of my favorite distilleries but hard to find) was distilled in September 1997 and spent some number of years in ex-bourbon before being transitioned to a Pedro Ximénez sherry butt to finish for a total of 18 years in cask. Chieftain’s bottled the whisky in October 2015 at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added color. This bottle is from Cask #91792 which produced 579 bottles for the US market. I bought it at K&L Wines in Redwood City for $99 and it sat in the back of my cabinet until I finally opened it recently. That’s all to say you’re not going to be able to find a bottle. Luckily you’re not really missing out.Even though $99 is a good price for an 18 year-old single malt especially a sherried Mortlach it didn’t take much tasting to conclude that this is the kind of thing that winds up on the independent market these days. It probably sat in a warehouse for a number of years before being chosen like the last scrawny kid being picked for dodgeball teams. (That was me by the way.) The moral of the story is Don’t expect to find gold under independent labels anymore. It can still happen but you’re more likely to get deals than gems.Nose Dense dark sticky resin. Jammy and thick with notes of cooked blackberry plum/prune fig and not-quite-rancio notes of shoe leather wood rot and old wax. Not sweet but there are notes of dense torte and fudge. Prominent nose tickle. A rest in the glass brightens the fruit a bit.Palate Thin body. More jam although the palate is austere and flavors seem sparse. Red wine vinegar… old-vine Zinfandel… port wine reduction… coffee grounds… Finish Somewhat short. A dominant grape skin note complete with red wine tannins and a bramble-like woodiness. Dusty. The finish happens quickly leaving only the taste of old wet attic behind. Clearly a sense memory from my own life because that taste descriptor sounds downright daft. “I get a soupçon of wet attic.” Bah. Get over yourself Noob.With Water Several drops of water increase the nose tickle but don’t seem to affect the aroma. The palate is a little more coherent with fewer “dark” or resin-like notes and more fruity high notes. There is more caramel on the finish and it might hold together longer. Try without water and then add just a little to see how it changes for you.Overall Not as meaty or profound as some other Mortlachs that I’ve had. Luckily it is not noticeably sulfured but the notes are eclectic and inconsistent like a tapestry riddled with holes. A good example of the kind of thing that filters through the secondary market for single malt barrels without making a fuss and probably would have performed much better as the sherry notes in a high-end blend. You aren’t going to find it anywhere but at $99+ you’re not missing out.
103,Chivas Regal (12 year) Blended Scotch - Awhile back (May 19 2011) I tasted a 50ml sample bottle (plastic) of Chivas Regal (12 year-old) blended scotch. I hated it. After a few conversations I’ve come to realize that one cannot rely upon plastic miniature (or even glass sometimes) bottles to deliver a representation of the actual product. Whisky companies either need to bottle these more carefully or find an alternative way to distribute samples. Some people make brand loyalty decisions based on these things.Anyway I had an opportunity to sample the same whisky from a full bottle this holiday season. It’s not as bad as I originally made out. Below find my new tasting notes and for the sake of completeness my original articleNose White chocolate and golden raisins. A small amount of berry jam and a great deal of unadorned cereal grain. The nose is quite muted and the prickle very mild. I wouldn’t call it elegant but I would call it light. A dash of water brings out more grain provoking a vodka-like dryness that I’m not fond of. I originally identified it as ‘sharp alcohol fumes’.Palate Vanilla. Custard and sugar cookies. Very mild fruit – dried cherries? And some nuttiness… hazelnut and a hint of milk chocolate. Somewhat thin body but eminently smooth. A bit of water creates a honeyed note.Finish Medium-long. Bit of a woody twist with some bitterness showing through. Nut skins. Malty while fading and golden raisins.Overall It’s a very mild very inoffensive blend with middle-of-the-road flavors. It’s quite smooth if that’s all you’re looking for and the price is right… sub $25 or so. Great King Street Artist’s Blend is “better” in that its grain is better-integrated its body is heftier and it has more than just standard scotch flavor. It’s also $20 more per bottle. On the other hand Johnnie Walker built its empire on “standard scotch flavor” so it’s not my right to dismiss it. If you want something you don’t have to pay attention to for less than $30 you can’t go too wrong with Chivas 12 but I urge regular Chivas drinkers to expand their horizons with an occasional bottle of sub-$40 single malt.I’m leaving the “Not Recommended” mark partially because the miniature was truly unappetizing but also because I feel that there are better alternative for the money. Teacher’s Johnnie Walker Black and Glenlivet 12 all have something extra for the same money and Great King Street Artist’s Blend is simply better all-around for an extra chunk of change.Nose Sharp with alcohol fumes but little else – maybe some apricot and young white wine. A dash of water does nothing to improve it.Palate Smooth but with a twinge of overdryness. Right before the sweet malt sets in midpalate there is a heavy dose of wet cigarette ash. I want to like it so I keep tasting and get a few notes of that apricot and a little fresh hay and something briny like dried seaweed. A little water only accentuates the cigarette ash and adds an unappealing second-hand tobacco smoke note.Finish has a layer of butter and caramel but that ash comes back. Warming and medium-long with a bubbling up of malty sweetness at the tail end.Overall Yes this is Scotch but it tastes like it’s been watered down with paint thinner and peated malt feints. There is no earthiness from whatever peated malt was used and the sweetness vanishes too quickly leaving you with a mouthful of bottom-shelf stuff. I feel unsatisfied like it offered me something of substance and then pulled a bait-and-switch. I now want a glass of something better. This has done nothing to elevate my opinion of blended Scotches.
104,Clyde May’s Straight Bourbon - This story is getting so old even I’m bored of writing it. An upstart distillery not ready yet blah blah and blah. The marketing package complete with pretty illustrations and so so many fonts involves an Alabama moonshiner and his various escapades that bear little relevance to the whiskey. It’s worth noting that Clyde May invented “Alabama Style” whiskey (really moonshine) by adding dried apples to barrels of new make. Conecuh Ridge Distillery Inc. (not a distillery) which owns the brand also sells an “Alabama Style” version of Clyde May’s complete with the apple flavor. A quick note on the apple thing The website calls it “a natural essence of apple” which makes me leery that they’re just adding apple flavoring to the bottles and not aging the whiskey with dried apples as was the tradition started by their namesake. More research is warranted if you’re interested in that kind of thing.This review is for the Straight Bourbon (not the Alabama Style) which is sourced whiskey from an undisclosed Kentucky distillery. The Internet suggests Heaven Hill is likely although KBD (now MGP) sourced the whiskey for the first couple of runs of Conecuh Ridge Alabama Style whiskey so it’s also possible that Clyde May’s continued that practice when MGP started distilling. The sourced whiskey is aged for 4-5 years (so 4) in alligator-charred new oak barrels. The liquid is bottled without chill filtration which isn’t something you normally see on American whiskey labels. Oh and the company (and bottling plant) is based in Florida so these whiskeys have literally nothing to do with Alabama. Everything else on the label is pure pseudo-legal marketing bunk and can safely be ignored.The company also produces the aforementioned apple-infused Alabama Style whiskey (which can’t be called bourbon because of the apples) a 110 proof “Special Reserve” Alabama Style a 9 year-old Cask Strength Alabama Style and a Straight Rye.Nose A mid-line bourbon with an interesting tart high note. Cherry light corn and grains not aggressive.Palate Thin body. Woody upfront with a mild tongue burn. The oak is bold and complex but borders on cardboardy (nope not a word) and there’s a lot of it obscuring the more delicate whiskey notes. Edging toward dry but with just enough (oaky) sweetness to keep balance.Finish Medium-long. Nutty with the oak taking a backseat contributing only some welcome drying tannins. Some bitterness (probably from all that oak) creeps in at the end. Pleasant but commonplace.With Water A few drops of water make the aroma oddly shy even after several minutes of rest. The water brings some nuttiness to the palate and thins the oak enough to bring out complexity. I suggest giving it a good smell before adding the water which does help make the whiskey coherent on the tongue.Overall A decidedly middle-of-the-road bourbon. The cherry notes are nice but rote and the palate would be well-balanced if it weren’t for a heavy hand with the oak. For what it’s worth it also makes a very acceptable (indeed slightly above-average) Old Fashioned where those oak notes are welcome and stand up to bitters nicely. I marked this “Try Before Buy” because this is $35 not $20 but if that doesn’t bother you the bourbon is just fine and you won’t likely be disappointed.
105,Clynelish (14 year) - How have I not had Clynelish yet? This glaring hole in my whisky journey was remedied last night thanks to a 30ml sample I purchased (along with 33 (!) others) from Master of Malt‘s Drinks by the Dram service. If you want to try a bunch of whisky without buying whole bottles and your home state/country/province allows residential shipment of alcohol there is NO better way than Drinks by the Dram. Just be warned that 30ml is not a lot of liquid.Clynelish has a confusing history. What we see on the shelf now was distilled at a large modern facility built in 1967-1968 to supplement the two pot stills at the old Clynelish distillery which is now referred to as Brora. The old distillery built in 1819 had a long and varied legacy of producing highly-regarded (and often sold-out) malt whisky. Today the name Brora causes single-malt fanatics to foam at the mouth because of its rarity and exclusiveness – the distillery was closed for good in 1983. Bottles labeled “Clynelish” and distilled before 1967 would have been well-peated and originated in the old distillery. Bottles labeled “Clynelish” and distilled between 1967 and 1983 could have come from either distillery (which for a short time were named Clynelish 1 and Clynelish 2!) although the newer facility used lightly-peated malt (around 30ppm compared to Highland Park’s 20ppm and Ardbeg’s 50ppm) and thus can be distinguished. Anything labeled “Brora” was distilled at the old distillery between 1967 and 1983 and is very valuable now.Diageo uses the lion’s share of the “new” Clynelish distillery’s output to form the basis of its Johnnie Walker Gold Label blend as well as other Diageo blends. Until recently the only source of Clynelish single malt was through independent bottlers and one-off releases (such as Diageo’s Flora and Fauna series). Now thankfully official bottlings of Clynelish 14-year and a Distiller’s Edition are available. Clynelish distillery is positioned on the eastern coast of Scotland’s North Highland region somewhat near Old Pulteney. Its malt is often said to be waxy briny and mildly peated. Although unconfirmed I’ve read that the malt is aged in both ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks.Nose Fresh ripe plums red grapes indeed a whole fruit punch barely masking deep nutty barley. A sour high note stands out – similar to Highland Park’s floral peatiness this hint of citrus is very well-integrated – so much so that I didn’t realize the malt was peated at first. Everyone else detects a note of brine – but I’m not getting it. A very robust multi-layered aroma and one that stands up to a lot of analysis.Palate Somewhat thin mouthfeel but also soft with round welcoming flavors of caramel. The peat notes dance on the palate – sprightly and bright – while the whole evolves to a saltwater taffy-like interplay of sweet salty and fruity. I love a whisky that changes – progresses – on the tongue and this does it better than most.Finish Ahh now I get the brine. Like the taste of seawater in your mouth after swimming in the ocean. Drying and more smoky now. Black pepper sticky dates and salted caramels. A twist of bitter lemon peel on the exit. Relatively short finish except for the lemon peel.With Water Adds candied lemon peel to the nose thins the already-thin palate burns a bit more than expected on the tongue and does little for the finish. I don’t see any reason to add water to this although a sip of water AFTER a sip of malt plays nicely – mitigating that bitter lemon peel note.Overall This reminds me of Old Pulteney – with a chameleon-like shifting from briney and smoky to soft and sweet to fruity and sour. While eclectic I cannot call it disjointed. The transitions between personalities is seamless and the experience whole. I’ve never had anything quite like Clynelish and I think it’s an experience that any serious malt drinker should have.Frankly it’s a travesty that the majority of this ends up in Johnnie Walker. While no doubt the Johnie Walker tastes better with the Clynelish in it the Clynelish can’t be anything but worsened by the marriage. Luckily Diageo has thrown single malt lovers a bone by releasing and continuing this 14 year-old official bottling. We can just tell ourselves that all the “bad” Clyenlish goes into JW anyway.
106,Colonel E.H. Taylor Small Batch Bourbon - Colonel E.H. Taylor is a brand owned by prolific distiller Buffalo Trace. The brand consists of a large number of expressions (per their website) nearly all of which I’ve never seen on store shelves. The Small Batch though seems to be widely available. The Small Batch is bottled in bond and (therefore) is 50% ABV and at least 4 years old. It’s appropriate that this whiskey is bottled in bond because its namesake Colonel Edmund Haynes Taylor Jr. was one of the first proponents of the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897 which protected American bourbon from unscrupulous retailers and counterfeiters. The Colonel called the Father of the Bourbon Industry mostly by people who own his brand was the financier and later owner of several early distilleries. He is known for his innovation of production processes and leadership in lobbying the government on behalf of the early American bourbon industry. His Old Taylor brand of bourbon is still produced by Buffalo Trace. This Small Batch (and the other expressions in the Colonel E.H. Taylor brand) are modern tributes to the Colonel first released in 2013 and intended as “premium” or luxury versions of Old Taylor.Details are sparse but we know that the Colonel E.H. Taylor whiskies are from Buffalo Trace’s mash bill #1 a low-rye (estimated below 10%) mash shared by Buffalo Trace bourbon Stagg and Eagle Rare.Nose Shy even after a rest in the glass. The overall impression is mellow corn sweetness with a delectable assortment of floral notes and subtle caramels and fudges. Very little nose tickle even deep in the glass. Definitely subtle but also complex – there’s a lot to pick apart in there.Palate Syrupy body with a silk-like texture. A mild (for 50% ABV) tongue burn is followed by light oaky tannins more corn-based sugars and caramels mildly bitter nut skins and almond butter. A second taste reveals lightly tart fresh cherries.Finish Of medium length. The same silky mellowness translates to the finish which is nearly devoid of bitterness and simply continues most of the flavor notes. I could wish for a bit more evolution here but that’s splitting hairs.With Water A few drops of water initially sap the aroma of any presence so give it a little time after adding water. The water seems to add a nice taffy note and also a pretty elderflower note and more cherry to the palate. Try first without water and then add just a little.Overall An excellently solid if laid-back bourbon for a price that shows that Buffalo Trace knows its quality. You’re not getting a deal for sure but you are getting your money’s worth. The whiskey is more impressively mellow when you compare it to other 100-proof bourbons. It’s also better than some “craft” $50 bourbons that I’ve had. Colonel E.H. Taylor is different enough from other ‘standards’ on the market that I’m marking it a “Must Try”. This is especially a must if you’ve grown tired of the overly-oaked overly-brash bourbons that are common on shelves these days.
107,Compass Box – 3 Year Old Deluxe - Any of my long-time readers know that I’m a squealing fanboy when it comes to Compass Box and I’m not about to stop soon. The innovative blended scotch whisky company is about to launch two new Limited Editions The 3 Year Old Deluxe and the Spice Tree Extravaganza (review of the Spice Tree is upcoming).This Limited bottling is a direct reaction (a political commentary even) to the recent issues that Compass Box has faced with transparency and EU and UK labeling laws. In short they’ve been told they can’t reveal the ages of the various components in their blends except for the youngest one. For example if they were to put a teaspoon of five year-old Glenlivet into a vat containing 30 year-old Clynelish and bottle it they cannot say the phrase “30 years old” in any public context even buried on their website. They are allowed to say “5 years old” or no age at all. As many of you are aware the result of this law is the growing proliferation of “NAS” or “No Age Statement” whiskies.The 3 Year Old Deluxe is a thumbed nose at UK regulations because it contains (unspecified ages of) older whiskies with 0.4% of 3 year-old Clynelish. Remember that three years is the minimum allowed age for scotch whisky so celebrating “3 years old” in large obnoxious font on the bottle label and marketing materials is the corporate labeling equivalent of peacefully picketing the UK parliament building with signs and chanting “Hey No We Won’t Go!” In order to adhere to the letter of the law Compass Box cannot publicly reveal the ages of the older components in this (or any other) blend but they CAN tell you privately if you email them and just ask. Just please don’t share this information on forums blogs or comment sections as that could open Compass Box up to accusations of third-party marketing.As is custom with Compass Box these days the components of this whisky are scrupulously detailed. Rather than try to transcribe it all here I’ll just share the handy diagramIn effect it’s a blended malt scotch whisky with 90% old-ish Clynelish and 10% old-ish sherried Talisker bottled at a robust 49.2% ABV without added color or chill filtration. In accordance with the age and quality of the whisky (and not the minimum age on the label) this is not going to be cheap… think around $200. That means I’m not going to end up with a bottle of this unless Compass Box finally comes to their senses and starts sending me free whisky in exchange for all of the positive reviews I’ve given them. (I kid.) Still I’m not one to look a gift 50ml sample in the mouth so here goesNose Uhh. Wow? Passion fruit and intense florals Like walking into a flower shop full of drifting pollen. Waxy (hello Clynelish!) natural beeswax candles. Full of enticing juicy exotic fruits on a bed of light unassuming marshmallow malt. Despite the age of the components the effect is not of “old whisky” but rather “perfect whisky” – the aroma is hands-down flawless.Palate Medium syrupy body. Entirely without tongue burn (“smooth”). More beeswax plus a reprise of the fruit-salad promised by the aroma. Bubblegum honey fruit cordial and meringue.Finish Medium-short. Warming. Tart peach and vanilla frosting. Fades with sweet cherry and shortcake. No bitterness.With Water A few drops of water punch up the tart fruits and add white tea and a hint of green banana. The water also adds a layer of silky vanilla fondant to the palate which makes it fuller. It also (finally!) lets slip a hint of peat on the finish which is muted but delicately smoky – like the smoke from a fruit-flavored hookah tobacco.Overall Possibly the most decadent aroma I’ve ever experienced in a whisky. This is master blending at its unremitting finest. It probably helps that I could drink well-chosen Clynelish all day long but the combination of beeswax with tart fruits and seriously intense florals makes this artful as well as delicious. I wish the Talisker was a little more in evidence but then again I dislike it when the peated component takes over a blend so this might be better. Now if only it weren’t $200 I could give it higher than a “Recommended” score. If you’ve got the scratch and appreciate subtlety in your whisky you won’t be disappointed. Also if I’ve just described you the donate button is right down there. 
108,Compass Box – Flaming Heart (5th Edition) - This is the fifth release of Flaming Heart from Compass Box and it coincides with the company’s fifteen-year anniversary. Any of my readers know that I have deep respect for John Glaser and for Compass Box and anyone who has been following the “whisky news” lately knows that John got in some trouble for this release (along with “This is Not a Luxury Whisky” review upcoming). Apparently posting detailed recipe information including ages of components on your website and in marketing materials violates the EU liquor labeling laws regarding age. As you might know any bottle with an age on it must represent the youngest whisky in that bottle – a blend of 7-year 16-year and 40-year whiskies that wants to print an age on the bottle must print “7 years” and nothing else. While this is a good law that protects whisky buyers from unscrupulous labeling practices it’s being used by the SWA (Scotch Whisky Association) to once again rap the knuckles of one of the most innovative whiskymakers in the world.I’m very much in favor of transparency in the whisky industry. I think it is not only laudable for a company to post detailed component information on its website I think it should be common practice. The idea that the SWA would throttle the publishing (and not on the bottle!) of such useful information is disappointing and in my opinion is a step backwards for the industry. So although Compass Box cannot post this information on their website nothing is stopping me from doing it!Flaming Heart Fifth Edition is a Blended Malt Scotch Whisky (meaning it consists of malt from different distilleries but no grain whisky). It contains (percentages by volume)I eat this kind of info up. The result is bottled at 48.9% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring. This edition was bottled in August of 2015.The goal of Flaming Heart has always been to showcase Compass Box’s hybrid barrels with new French oak heads in balance with quality Islay peated malts. This 15th anniversary edition kicks up that formula with some older Caol Ila. This kicking up also comes with a larger price-tag than previous editions around $140.Nose Clear crisp lemony peat. Oily tart and waxy. After a rest in the glass there might be a hint of menthol.Palate Wow. Meaty/chewy with lemon rind tart lemon meringue pie. Nearly sparkles on the tongue. Elegantly smoky with refined clean-burning peat smoke and sea breeze.Finish Medium-long. Lemon continues with roasted chestnuts and spent campfire. Fades with very little bitterness.With Water A little water enhances the waxy “crayon” aroma which is uniquely Clynelish. It also brings out a little coconut and mutes the smoke on the nose. The palate and finish seem unchanged. A little water is advisable but try it without first.Overall A majestic whisky with elegance freshness and complexity all given equal share. The crisp tart lemon flavors pervade the experience and perfectly counterpoint the restrained-but-evident nature of the peat smoke. The peat is pristine with no muddiness bitterness or off-flavors and the entirety is well-balanced from start to finish. This is one of those rare whiskies that makes you say “Wow” out loud when given a whiff and never contradicts that first impression. Well done sir.This would be a “Must Have” for any Compass Box fans (or fans of subtle well-executed peat) who won’t faint at the $140 price tag. For everyone else it’s a “Must Try” from one of the bottles of your nearest Compass Box fan.
109,Compass Box – Peat Monster (2019 Edition) - Unlike basically everybody who wrote about whisky in 2004 I never reviewed the original Peat Monster from Compass Box. I tasted it a few times at whisky shows and always found it dry and lacking in both the maritime complexity one expects from Islay peat and any kind of characteristic that warrants the “monster” moniker. I have notes that say it reminded me of the Highland peated malts that I didn’t (and still don’t) prefer like Ledaig and peated BenRiach. Only 11% of the blend was comprised of peated Highland malts (Ledaig and Ardmore) so that was probably all in my head.Thanks to Debbie at The Collective PR I was able to sample a slate of Compass Box malts including this one a reformulation of the Peat Monster recipe new for 2019. You can tell the difference at the shop by the labels. The old Peat Monster label was a brown and gold illustration of the eponymous monster. The new one is a painting of said monster in a desert landscape (the same one used on the 10th anniversary bottling).The new formula still relies on Caol Ila and Laphroaig but at a different ratio and without the extraneous peated Highland malts. The new Peat Monster contains 64% Caol Ila and 35% Laphraoig plus 1% of the French Oak-finished batch of blended Highland malts that John Glaser seems to be throwing into everything these days. The blended malt is bottled at 46% ABV without chill filtration and has no added coloring. If you want to know the ages of the components I believe Compass Box is still giving out that information if you ask their Support email address as long as you promise not to spread it around.The question on my mind is if you toss Caol Ila and Laphroaig into a ring which one wins?Nose A monster indeed. Unlike the previous PM release I can tell at first glance that this is nearly all Islay malt. Seagrass and iodine from Laphroaig with campfire and sweet roasty vanilla from Caol Ila. The balance is sublime although the edge in style points goes to Laphroaig which wins the arm wrestle.Palate Thin body. Smoked seaweed is in the fore (a point to Laphroaig!) with undercurrents of smoked jerky vanilla toasted nuts and briny pickle juice.Finish Long. A continuation of the previous notes. One more point to Laphroaig which is still dominant. Bitterness is minimal (despite both of these malts tending to carry some) and the finish fades very slowly with only slight changes to the smoke. At the tail end Caol Ila dominates with puffy vanilla clouds and charcoal dust.With Water A few drops of water initially wash out the aroma which recovers. The water doesn’t have much effect on the rest except perhaps amping up the smoke on the palate and finish. Water optional.Overall It is fascinating (to me but I’m weird like that) to find that a 35% proportion of Laphroaig would take over the aroma and flavor profiles against a 64% proportion of Caol Ila. The final effect is a very successful blend where Laphroaig takes center stage and is supported with the depth and fullness of Caol Ila. The best of both worlds if you will but you kind of have to already be a Laphroaig fan to enjoy those iodine notes.
110,Compass Box – Spice Tree - Oddly I had reviewed the special-edition Spice Tree Extravaganza from Compass Box but not the standard Spice Tree bottling. The Spice Tree itself has a storied history originally comprised of whisky aged in barrels with toasted French Oak staves inserted. However the SWA (Scotch Whisky Association) ruled that this violated regulations covering how scotch may be matured and demanded that Compass Box remove Spice Tree from the market threatening legal action. Compass Box complied and re-released the Spice Tree after aging it in barrels with new toasted French Oak heads coopered onto them which IS acceptable to the SWA and the law.So what is Spice Tree? It’s a blended malt scotch whisky meaning it is made entirely of malt whisky from more than one Scottish distillery. Rather than try to describe the combination of cask types involved I will just include Compass Box’s own handy infographicIn essence it’s a mixture of 60% Clynelish 20% Dailuaine and 20% Teaninich the majority of which is then finished for two years in various toast (heat-treated) grades of the aforementioned French Oak-topped barrels. This is intended to bring out the “spice” notes inherent in French Oak as well as contribute to the sweet oaky flavor available when using new oak (as opposed to re-used oak which is the vast majority of wood used in the aging of scotch). Compass Box is careful to blend batches using various levels of toast and without 100% of the whisky touching the new oak heads as new oak has a reputation for creating overly-wooded whisky. This is of course what all bourbon and many other American whiskies are aged in so the caution may or may not be warranted. Still I trust John Glaser Compass Box’s founder and master blender whose reputation as a blender is well recognized.The married whiskies are then bottled at 46% ABV without added coloring and without chill filtration and forms part of Compass Box’s consistent portfolio. If you want to know the (approximate they vary) ages of the components used simply email Compass Box in accordance with their Campaign for Transparency.Nose Lemon balm candle wax (hello Clynelish!). White fruits (white peach or white mulberries or something) delicate peachy florals and light airy honey. A simple aromatic pleasure and totally devoid of anything I would call “spice”. After a rest in the glass some green banana.Palate Syrupy waxy body. Sweet and honeyed. More peach with some dessert wine flavors (riesling maybe). White sangria. On the back side of the palate something nutty… maybe hazelnuts and a bare touch of oak that comes across as stale cinnamon sticks. Maybe this is the “Spice”?Finish Short. Fading fruits now dried apricot and tannic white tea. These fade cleanly and without bitterness.With Water A scant few drops of water dumps puréed banana all over the aroma. This dissipates to reveal an herby anise note and some coconut. The rest of the experience is unchanged. Water optional here it really doesn’t need it. Note that after a longer rest I’m able to detect the candied ginger and gingerbread notes alluded to in the marketing.Overall Spice be damned this is a wonderfully pleasant dram. I’m a sucker for peach flavors in a whisky and doubly so for the unique waxy texture and aroma that Clynelish brings to the table. I could wish for a little heavier dose of that nutty French Oak flavor. Of Compass Box’s regular vatted (sorry – “blended malt”) scotch releases this is probably the best. At $70 it’s pricey but doesn’t disappoint. I will probably buy a full bottle of this for serving after special meals.
111,Compass Box – Spice Tree Extravaganza - Like the recently-released 3 Year Old Deluxe this limited-edition bottling is a political commentary on the troubles that Compass Box has had with innovation-squelching laws and regulations. This being the 10-year anniversary of Compass Box having to halt production of the original Spice Tree a blended whisky with French oak barrel staves inserted into the barrels (a scotch whisky regulation no-no) the Extravaganza is a bumped-up version of the remade Spice Tree which uses toasted new French oak barrel heads instead of inserted staves in accordance with regulation. Compass Box’s attempts to maximize transparency apply to this bottling as well however they cannot publicly reveal the ages of the older components in this (or any other) blend. They CAN tell you privately if you email them and ask. Just please don’t share this information on forums blogs or comment sections as that could open Compass Box up to accusations of third-party marketing.As is custom with Compass Box these days the components of this whisky are scrupulously detailed. Rather than try to transcribe it all here I’ll just share the handy diagramWow so boiling that down it’s like a sherried Spice Tree but with older-than-usual components. You’ve got some Clynelish Dailuaine Teaninich Glen Ord Benrinnes and Allt-a-Bhainne and various sherry barrels bourbon barrels and the Spice Tree “Hybrid” barrels (ex-bourbon barrels with toasted new French oak heads) at varying char levels.The blended malt is bottled at 46% ABV without added color or chill filtration.Nose The sherry is apparent – full bright red fruits with a hint of darker preserves. A blanket of vanilla cake frosting pervades all but is studded with cloves and wisps of sandalwood. Overall malty and light with aspects of spice and sherry. A rest in the glass reveals some just-ripe banana.Palate Full bodied. Beeswax (Clynelish) but with a huge spike of baking spices (clove cinnamon mace and especially nutmeg) and fresh hay. This passes leaving cinnamon bun (with frosting) and ruby port.Finish Of medium length. Nutty with more jam notes. Not exactly peanut-butter-and-jelly… more like hazelnut-butter-and-fig-jam. Fades relatively quickly leaving singed cloves and sweet oak.With Water A few drops of water mute the sherry notes (alas) while highlighting some French Oak characteristics (cinnamon vanilla sandalwood). The palate has a little more cinnamon and vibrancy the finish a little more malty caramel. Still you should try this without water first. You probably won’t need to add any. Overall A very tasty if not exactly overwhelming blended malt. I expected to be wowed like I was with Flaming Heart’s Anniversary Edition. Instead I find a very competent blend with an interesting array of flavors for slightly too much money. However if you or someone you know are a fan of the basic Spice Tree this would be a worthy one-time upgrade for a special occasion… and Christmas is coming.
112,Compass Box – Story of the Spaniard (Batch 1) - Compass Box has been on a roll lately churning out special release after special release. It’s refreshing then to review a new permanent member of the Compass Box lineup. The Story of the Spaniard – awkward name aside – is both a nod to the common practice of maturing scotch whisky in Spanish sherry casks and also a reference to a special release bottling called The Spaniard that CB released for a bar by that name in New York. Don’t get the two editions mixed up on the shelf!Thanks to Debbie at The Collective PR I was able to sample a slate of Compass Box malts including this one. The Story of the Spaniard is a blended malt whisky (that is to say multiple single malts but no grain whisky) that is composed of malts aged in ex-sherry (48%) and Spanish red wine casks (25%). The vatting is bottled without added color or chill filtration at 43% ABV. As usual with Compass Box all of the information you could possibly want is available online except for the ages of the components for which you must email “hello at compassbox.com” to ask. 40% of the malt here is from “A distillery near Aberlour” which could mean Aberlour Macallan or Craigellachie. That latter is most likely. The component that is aged in Spanish red wine casks is from Teaninich.Compass Box is intending to release a batch or two a year based on availability of the Spanish red wine casks needed for the Teaninich.Nose Almost (but not quite) a sherry bomb. Sweet and unctuous and syrupy sherry with the usual dried-and-jammed fruit notes of fig and plum and apricot. Caramel sweet honeyed malt and maple syrup. Dense and enticing.Palate Thin body. Sweet and fruity upfront with all the notes promised by the aroma. Figs dates Christmas cake plump raisins and not-quite-resinous balsamic.Finish Medium-short. Some red wine tannins with a dash of oak and a hint of bramble. Fades quickly without evolving.With Water A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma without adding anything. There is perhaps some vanilla buttercream frosting. Maybe. The palate is similarly watered-down and… you know what? Just skip the water.Overall A fine sherry bomb. The Spanish red wine casks are noticeable but thankfully do not impede the flow of the whisky like many red wine finishes I’ve tasted in the past. They seem to contribute tannins and some fresh fruit notes without becoming overly bitter or uhh… “red winey”? There is a very manageable amount of bitter tannin here and an abundance of delectable sweet sherry notes. If it were $40 it would be my new go-to sherry bomb. At $60 it’s something I might consider purchasing when I’m in the mood. At that price-point it competes with a lot of excellent sherried whisky. GlenDronach 12 (a totally different type of sherry but comparable in quality and maturation age) can still be found for $45. Just sayin’.
113,Compass Box – Stranger & Stranger - Ok so picture that you’re Compass Box master blender and visionary John Glaser. You’re sick and tired of the SWA and the EU/UK labeling laws keeping you in “the box” and telling you what you are not allowed  to print on your labels in the name of transparency. What do you do? You decide to take a venerable old cask of Glenlossie and you dump in a teaspoon of 1 year-old spirit from Girvan grain distillery. You have just turned a very expensive cask of whisky into a rot-gut “Spirit Drink” in the eyes of the law. It can’t even be called ‘scotch’. Then you sell it for $180 a bottle. Now that’s what I call a perverse sense of humor and I fully laughed out loud when I read the fact sheet.The name is kind of unrelated to this whole “screw the man” approach to whiskymaking Stranger & Stranger is the name of the firm that designs Compass Box’s downright lovely bottle labels and other graphics and this release is to recognize 10 years of collaboration between the two companies.To be more specific about the makeup of this bottle it’s 80% ex-bourbon Glenlossie 14% ex-bourbon Glen Elgin 5% ex-sherry Linkwood and the aforementioned 1% of 1 year-old Girvan grain spirit. Note that the grain spirit is 1 year old because Glaser filled Girvan new-make into American oak barrels and “seasoned” the wood for a year before removing it. The “1%” in the blend is what was left in the barrels. I’m not allowed to tell you the ages of the other components (I promised) but feel free to email hello at compassboxwhisky.com and ask them yourself. Suffice it to say that this whisky on average is old enough to order its own scotch.For what it’s worth Stranger & Stranger is bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added color and was a limited release bottled in September of 2018. I received my tasting sample thanks to Debbie at The Collective PR. Thanks Debbie!Nose Extra shy right out of the bottle. Give it time in the glass. Even then the aroma is akin to freshly-dried laundry. Airy light and slightly but complexly fragrant. Green apple and/or apple blossom vanilla lemon peel and green banana.Palate Soft medium bodied. Densely surprisingly fruity. Juicy plums apricots apple cider green pears and melty caramel. On second tasting banana cream pie.Finish Medium length. A bit of a muddle. Green grapes… fresh banana… whipped cream… kiwi… and confectioner’s sugar. There is no bitterness. A weird one.With Water A few drops of water amp the nose tickle more than I like. The water adds a banana bread note. I would skip the water unless you want to experiment and see if you can make sense out of this.Overall I… What? This is a confusing dram. I started out thinking it was arid and lacking aroma. Next I found it to be bursting with juicy fresh fruits on the palate. Then I find a confusing muddle of disconnected notes on the finish.I get that this is a limited release and I respect the Hell out of John Glaser for adding what amounts to a teaspoon of 1 year-old grain whisky to a barrel of what is no doubt very expensive old Glenlossie which forces him to label this as a “Spirit Drink” instead of a Blended Malt. That kind of middle finger to the authorities-that-be… I absolutely love that. Still I just didn’t really enjoy the dram. It’s shy and has a vague muddled finish despite its tasty fruit-forward palate. I would be trying to sing the virtues of it if I had just tasted say a $50 Deanston. The fact that this is $180 should tell you all you need to know.
114,Compass Box – The Circle No. 1 - Here’s another Compass Box Limited Edition (there are so many to choose from!) The Circle No. 1. In 2018 Compass Box created an industry program called The Circle with the goal of connecting the bartending trade with the blending trade to further education and creativity in bartending. After a series of challenges the first annual winner Rosey Mitchell of London’s Three Sheets got to create a limited edition Compass Box blend. Released in July 2019 the aptly-named The Circle No. 1 is a collaboration between Rosey and Compass Box whiskeymaker Jill Boyd.Together they created a blended malt scotch whisky that they describe as “Sunshine in a Glass”. It is comprised of a majority of first-fill ex-bourbon Tamdhu about 15% refill ex-sherry Clynelish a little ex-bourbon malt “from Orkney” (which means Highland Park or Scapa – I’d guess HP since it’s peated) and a scant 1.5% of Compass Box’s standard French Oak cask Highland blend. If you’d like to know the ages of these components you are free to email hello at compassboxwhisky.com to ask (I’m not allowed to disclose them here). Suffice it to say this isn’t young whisky – or super old nothing is over 21 years of maturation. The final blend is bottled at 46% ABV with no added color and with no chill-filtration. They did decide to use “Light 5 Micron Filtration” which I’m guessing is a type of barrier filtration but I haven’t heard of it before. Barrier filtration is the typical industry alternative to chill filtration and is necessary to remove bits of char and debris that come from the cask.If Compass Box continues its bartending program we can expect to see an annual limited edition of The Circle (hence the “No. 1”).I received my tasting sample thanks to Debbie at The Collective PR.Nose Light and apple-y like a very fragrant hard cider. Floral with a ton of honeysuckle and clover flowers. As it sits in the glass the fruit evolves through white peach tart white (Rainier) cherries and finally to caramel apple. There are notes of nougat vanilla taffy and white chocolate. Lovely but very subtle.Palate Thick syrupy body. Waxy Clynelish malt up front with dense nougat and peanut fudge. Very little tongue burn. It takes awhile for the sherry notes to appear – mostly as dried apple and slightly bitter grape skin tannins. I do not detect any peat from the Highland Park (if that’s what it is).Finish Medium length. More nougat but only a whisper of the fruit notes from the aroma. Some bitterness (oak and/or charcoal). Fades with a bit of charcoal and a swath of licorice (anise). On subsequent tastings I find a nice thick layer of sweet malty barley (like breakfast cereal) here.With Water A few drops of water bring the dried apple notes to the aroma but mute some of the subtle floral notes. The palate and finish both get a little more tart bite. Try without water first and then add just a little to see how it changes for you.Overall The apple notes are subtle and harmonious on the aroma which is fantastic. The palate mostly seems like your average Compass Box blended malt and the finish is sparse but solid. The sherried components are very mild providing slight fruit notes rather than a fruit-forward character. This fits the bill as a “Summer” drink – light and complex and fun. “Sunshine in a glass” is a very accurate description.Unfortunately I cannot in conscience recommend a $150 blended malt for Summer or any other time. I’ve become used to Compass Box charging a premium for its artistry but this is not a $150 sip unless $150 is an irrelevant amount of money to you. Every time I evaluate another expression from the company I get the nagging feeling that John Glaser is no longer making new whisky intended for me. Compass Box continues to price me out of the market alas.
115,Compass Box – The Lost Blend - Compass Box discontinued the popular Eleuthera in 2004 citing lack of availability of one of the blended malt’s key components. John Glaser ever the romantic has been trawling the secondary cask market in Scotland looking for the perfect replacement. He found it in the form of an “extraordinary” cask of 19 year-old Allt-A-Bhainne in ex-bourbon wood. Alas there was only one such barrel and his re-creation of Eleuthera was fated to be a limited edition yielding 12018 bottles.Utilizing a similar recipe to Eleuthera The Lost Blend is composed of Clynelish (a John Glaser staple) Caol Ila and the aforementioned Allt-A-Bhainne. Eleuthera was intended to provide an easy-drinking alternative to the fiery peated whiskies that dominate the single malt scene. Although the picture above is too small to tell each of the three randomized labels is adorned with “lost” things such as the RMS Lusitania and the Dodo. Cute.The whisky is bottled at 46% ABV is not chill-filtered nor colored and retails for $120. Thanks to Debbie and Chris at The Collective PR for the sample!Nose A tangy dose of Caol Ila peat meets the nose accompanied by the clear sweet aroma of peach. Yum. Waxy Clynelish underscores both with its uncanny combination of candlewax and vanilla. The two are playful and thankfully not overly smoky or earthy. The combination is ethereal.Palate Waxy body and the charry smoke of Caol Ila cuts through immediately. There is a light chardonnay-like fruitiness underscored by buttery toasted oak. Again the smoke and fruit take turns at the forefront neither washing the other out or becoming muddied.Finish Medium-long and warming. The peat continues to smoulder as it goes to charcoal. The fruit fades quickly leaving no bitterness.With Water A few drops of water punch up the peat smoke and also reveal something floral like lavender. Certainly try this with a few drops.Overall This is (if memory serves) much more successful than Eleuthera was at both taming Islay smoke and marrying it to fruit. The clean crisp notes of peach and white grapes carry through from nose to finish never allowing the peat to dominate. Masterfully blended – a truly excellent example of skilled blending and what it can accomplish.
116,Compass Box – This is Not a Luxury Whisky - So… I love Compass Box. I do. I think they make some of the most innovative and most interesting products in the whisky market and they make several of my favorite blended scotches and blended malts. Unfortunately I just didn’t get this one.I mean I get the joke. I’m not going to talk about Magritte because I don’t know the first thing about art and I’d just embarrass myself if I tried but I get that John is making a commentary on the silliness of the collectible whisky segment of the market and the producers that keep pandering to them with more and more ridiculously-packaged collectible releases.I just don’t get the whisky. This is a blend of some seriously old scotch (and I love me some old scotch) with a price tag to match ($250 or so. Eek!) so I was disappointed to find that the whisky just didn’t click for me. I found it marginally good with some decidedly ‘old’ flavors but nothing to make my eyes roll back in my head. For $250 I expect some involuntary paroxysms of ecstasy.Aside from the taste the specs are spot-on. Compass Box was kind enough to tell us EXACTLY what’s in this whisky. Read my rant on Flaming Heart – Fifth Edition for more about how the SWA reacted to this kind of transparencyThe grain and malt make it a Blended Scotch Whisky. It’s bottled at 53.1% ABV (cask strength) without chill-filtration or added coloring. It was bottled in August 2015 with only 4992 bottles filled. Nose Supple – like new leather – and not at all hot. Ripe bananas dried apricots. Subtle smoke cocoa nibs. Deep in the glass there’s something buttery that reminds me of chocolate croissants.Palate Creamy and silky. Entry is a little hot. Marzipan smoked almonds muted campfire smoke. Sherry comes across as desiccated figs nearly devoid of sweetness but resinous and umami. A hint of barnyard (old hay).Finish Long. Quite bitter like Campari without the sugar or very strong black coffee. Charcoal. Fades with salty wisps of smoke.With Water A few drops of water bring out a nice caramel roundness and balances out the heavy banana. Now the predominant aroma is of salted caramels. The same is true of the palate which burns less and has a touch more sweetness that provides better balance. It’s amazing that only 4% by volume of Caol Ila could have yielded so much peaty smoke in the blend.Overall I’m torn (cue the Natalie Imbruglia). I expected some luxurious sherry notes but found them mostly dried up. I expected a faint echo of peat from the Caol Ila and found it bathed in smoke especially on the tongue. Added water brought some much-needed balance but still I suspect that slightly-peated blends even of this calibre and advanced age are not my cup of tea.Still I must give John Glaser and Compass Box props for the exquisitely detailed component information for the tongue-in-cheek self-referential humor and the flat-out cojones to sell a $250 bottle of scotch – blended no less – with a label that looks like it was absentmindedly scrawled by a employee on the bottling line.I even went back and tasted this again the following day to see if I’d missed something. I found the same nose and the same palate although maybe a little better balanced with some nutty sweetness up front (hazelnuts). I was also able to taste some of the sherry this time like jammy pie filling. Still my overall reaction is still a resounding ‘Meh’. For the price that makes it an easy “Not Recommended” but I’ll mark it “Try Before Buy” because it’s possible I got a bad sample or (more likely) had some repressed taste memory that this triggered or something. Sorry John! I still love you! Please love me back!
117,Compass Box Asyla - Asyla is a blend of 50% malt whisky (I’m guessing a large portion of that is Clynelish which Compass Box’s John Glaser uses like it’s going out of style As pointed out by Dan in the comments Compass Box’s website states that the components “come from the towns of Longmorn (Longmorn) and Alness (which means either Dalmore or Teaninich with my bet being on Teaninich) and NOT Clynelish with the grain whisky from Fife (Cameronbridge)” — thanks Dan!) and grain whisky all aged in first-fill American oak (meaning ex-bourbon casks being used for the first time after draining the bourbon). The whisky is bottled at 40% without chill-filtration or added coloring agents.When I drink a blended scotch I’m looking for four things. First I want something easy-drinking and light-hearted that doesn’t get bogged down in complexities and eccentricities. Second I want crisp clear and above-all clean flavors that don’t remind me of paint thinner detergent or vodka sold in plastic jugs. Third a price point that falls into the “daily dram” category ($20 – $40 for me). Fourth I want a little flavor (since the first three conditions are met by pure water) – something that sets this drink apart from other products (especially other blends) – even if that flavor is one-dimensional.John Glaser I think is on the same page with me. Every Compass Box blend I taste speaks to me as the work of a master blender trying to hone in on those four qualities. Here we have easy-drinking lightness and clean and clear (decidedly non-vodka-esque) flavors. Alas the vanilla mashmallow and breakfast cereal notes are somewhat run-of-the-mill and (the deathblow) the bottle retails at $45 and up. Womp womp. Asyla is a tasty crisp unassuming blend with none of the dirty flavors of bottom-shelf blends but also few of the attractive qualities of single malts. One could call it a “drink it and forget it” kind of drink.I might have been less hard on Asyla if John Glaser hadn’t already outdone himself with Great King Street Artist’s Blend which I will never tire of pushing on you people. GKS has all four of the conditions laid out above – light character clean flavors $40 price point and some eyebrow-raising flavor. I can’t think of any reason to buy Asyla when Great King Street is on the shelf.Color Pale pale pale straw. Almost clear.Nose Evident Clynelish – waxy vegetal vanilla. This actually reminds me of a (really nice) Reposado Tequila. Deeper in a hint of lime juice or lemon peel. The aroma is sparse but clean.Palate A slight creaminess – certainly not thin. Vanilla returns and a layer of cereal sweetness.Finish Short but with some nice marshmallow vanilla custard and cream soda flavors. No bitterness.With Water A few drops of water seems to draw out the “new make” aspect of the younger components – revealing more cut grass or raw cane sugar types of notes. Water thins the palate adding nothing and is similarly ineffective for the finish. This needs no water.Overall This is a clean crisp and borderline bland example of what skillful hands can do with young or inexpensive whisky blending components. Although similar in price it is far more clean and elegant than most blended scotch on the planet. However its clean lines leave very little behind in terms of flavor or complexity. If you’re looking for an inexpensive blend without a lot of character but without any obvious flaws this is a good one to try.
118,Compass Box Eleuthera - While I would love to bring tasting notes and reviews to my readers exclusively about cutting-edge up-to-date scotch with wide availability… sometimes I’m just flat-out late to the party. I picked up a 50ml miniature of this vatted malt – sorry – “blended malt scotch whisky” from a bargain bin of forgotten minis at a Berkeley CA liquor store. Full bottles of the whisky itself are long since sold out and largely unremembered. Why am I telling you about it now? Because I don’t want to waste a full tasting note. Sorry. 🙂The product itself has been discontinued due to a lack of malt availability. Sometimes blended malts like this depend on found single-barrels that cannot be easily replaced or replicated once they run dry. I doubt there’s a lot of recharred Clynelish floating around. In this case John Glaser of Compass Box was looking for a way to make a smoky peaty blend which lacked the “fireplace” aftertaste often associated with the heavier Islays. He wanted an easy-drinking peated malt. To achieve this he blended a refill Caol Ila (one of the lightest Islays likely made even lighter by the refill barrel) with a refill Clynelish (a partially-sherried Highlander with mild waxy notes) and a little bit of Clynelish from a re-charred barrel. The latter was probably included to up the wood character which would have been missing from the refill casks.The result was released at craft presentation (46% ABV no color added no chill-filtering) for around $50 a bottle. You might still find a few dusty bottles of this floating around in bargain bins or in collections. You could probably also find the miniatures somewhere as there seems to have been some kind of major campaign to distribute them widely to liquor stores.(Note Initially there is little nose – let it breathe a few minutes after pouring).Nose The Caol Ila is right there up front – smoked paprika maple bacon fat and smouldering hay. Behind it lurks some orange blossom honey and a hint of floral notes – elderflower? A few drops of water amps up the florals but also increases the nose tickle.Palate Medium body with big peat in the lead. Muddy and woody at first but quickly yielding to the sweeter malt notes which blend well with the peat. There’s nothing subtle here – wood char salty peat and malty sweetness. These overshadow anything more delicate that might have been present in the original malts. A few drops of water seems to meld the flavors a bit better – and also brings out a little tangerine and lemon peel.Finish Medium-long. A bit salty – the peat has become a little astringent and the oak turned mildly bitter. I wish for some of the highland malt notes here but unfortunately they’re gone. It leaves me with a hint of nuttiness. With water there is a lot of citrus on the finish balancing the bitter notes much better.Overall I’m not sure I would call this “easy drinking” and I don’t think I would buy a bottle (if it were still available!). John did manage to achieve part of his goal a big peaty Caol Ila with a powerfully sweet highlander to give it some background. The peat isn’t off-putting but it doesn’t allow for much elegance to come through. The best part is the nose which deftly combines the best attributes of those two malts. If you do come across a dram try it with a little water.
119,Compass Box Hedonism - Hedonism by John Glaser’s Compass Box is an oddity in the scotch world. It is scotch because it is whisky made and aged in Scotland but it is actually a blended grain scotch whisky. John selects casks once or twice a year (depending on availability) that contain aged single-grain whiskies of high quality and maturity. These he blends to create Hedonism without so much as a drop of malt. Now before the grain pundits go thrashing about yelling ‘See?! Grain whisky is good!!” remember that these are high-quality long-aged single-grain whiskies. This is not the same stuff that goes into Johnnie Walker Black Label or Chivas 12. In fact if Diageo and Chivas and all the rest used this kind of grain whisky to make their blends us whisky geeks would be much more accepting of the bottom-shelf blends. Of course they’d also be significantly more expensive. As always you get what you pay for.Hedonism is made in once- or twice-yearly batches so any given bottling is likely to be somewhat different than a previous batch. Since these types of aged grain whiskies are less than common (especially with the recent shortages of everything with the word ‘scotch’ attached to it) John takes what he can get. Alas because Master of Malt doesn’t put batch numbers on its samples I don’t know which batch I tasted. Nevertheless you can count on Hedonism to be a shining example of what really good grain whisky is all about. Remember also that the style of grain whisky is lighter than most single malts and has a fuller creamier body. If you’re looking for robust fruity smoky or otherwise boldly-flavored drams look elsewhere. Here there be subtlety [SIC].Nose Sweet dairy cream malted milk balls fresh yeasty bakery bread. Vanilla in spades. Lots of nose tickle – practically crawls up your sinuses. Deep in there is a paint thinner quality but it is masked by the immediate creamy sweetness of the grain.Palate Immensely creamy body. Cinnamon nutmeg powdered sugar. Depths of vanilla custard and almond butter.Finish Crisp and clean if somewhat brief. Shortbread marzipan and roasted almonds. No bitterness to speak of. Very elegant.With Water A splash of water brings an almost gin-like flush of herbs and green grass notes to the nose without thinning the body too much. It loses some of its sweetness on the tongue though and appears to have less depth. I suggest trying a few drops of water in your last sip but not the whole glass.Overall I don’t know if I’d call it hedonistic but this is a prime example of what can be done with skillful blending and excellent grain whiskies. The nose is light and sweet the flavor is packed with bakery sweets and spices and the finish is crisp elegant and flawless. It reminds me of the company’s newer product Great King Street “Artist’s Blend” but amped up and streamlined. It’s a pricey bottle but buying a John Glaser blend is somewhat like buying a fine painting – sure you could get a cheaper print to hang on your wall but you’d get more enjoyment out of something made by a master.
120,"Compass Box Hedonism Quindecimus - A little confession Once in awhile a little package arrives at my front door addressed to “The Scotch Noob”. This can only be one thing. Free whisky! It doesn’t happen often and when it does it’s usually 100ml or so but nothing makes the trials and travails of the whisky blogger’s life more worthwhile than the occasional drop of free whisky. This is especially true when that glorious little 100ml bottle contains something precious that I’d never otherwise have an opportunity to sample like Compass Box’s recent limited edition release of Hedonism – this one called ‘Quindecimus’ a tortured way to name the bottling after Compass Box’s 15-year anniversary. Hedonism is a still a blend of top-notch scotch single grain whiskies with no malt in sight. This special release is a blend of grain from four distilleries of various ages none of which are younger than 20 years of age and all of which matured in ex-bourbon American oak casks. The result is bottled at 46% ABV with no added color and no chill filtration.I particularly like Compass Box’s quote from Oscar Wilde that graces the marketing materials for Quindecimus. Words to live by and no mistakeEverything in moderation including moderation.
– Oscar WildeDo I worry about the ethics of reviewing whisky that I’ve received for free? Maybe but it helps that Compass Box has pretty much never made a bad product so I don’t have to feel bad about recommending them. 🙂Nose Wow. Even at only 46% this takes your nose by storm. A cacophony of mown hay aloe vera exotic dried citrus peels vanilla bean violets that thing that’s been giving me seasonal allergies for the past week and six or seven other aromas I can’t name. Complex evolving and fascinating.Palate Mildly creamy body. Slightly grassy but backed up with fresh vanilla sugar cane cream of wheat and coconut-flour cake. Quite sweet on the back palate but not cloying.Finish Long. A reprise of the palate – mostly vanilla and sugar cane but with a few hints of the potpourri of aromas. Fades with coconut and is never bitter.With Water A few drops of water actually hide some of the fainter aromas. I don’t recommend any water with this – it certainly doesn’t need it.Overall Unreal. A testament to the blender’s skill and irrefutable proof that grain whisky can be ethereal. Personally I don’t conclude from this that grain whisky in general is good but that most blenders are clearly cutting costs and using inferior grain. Why can’t more blended whisky taste even slightly like this?"
121,Compass Box Oak Cross - I write this with something of a heavy heart I love most everything that John Glaser creates and have ultimate respect for the man. Unfortunately Oak Cross didn’t resonate for me as I’ll describe below. Either something in the mix reacted specifically with my tastes or John’s experiment went a little wide of the mark. Whatever it is I can’t recommend it based on my tasting. Out of a sense of balance though everyone should go buy a Great King Street or Hedonism instead!What is Oak Cross? The name refers to a John Glaser experiment to ‘cross’ the oak maturation styles of American quercus alba and French quercus alba (oak) which is rarely used in whisky maturation. American oak generally imbues spirit with notes of vanilla – which can be readily tasted in bourbon while French oak imparts much stronger spicier flavors of clove and nutmeg which are redolent in Cognac and Armagnac. John took several already-aged (10 to 12 years in American oak) malts vatted sorry blended them and married them in a second maturation of up to 2 years in 60% first-fill ex-bourbon casks and 40% ‘Oak Cross’ casks made by fitting new French oak heads onto American oak casks. The result was bottled at 43% ABV without chill-filtration or added color. This is a blended malt scotch whisky with no grain whisky added (that would have made it a blended scotch whisky).While the marketing materials for Oak Cross state only the villages in which the three malt components were made interviews with John Glaser since have revealed the exact malts in the recipe Clynelish from the village of Brora (for “fruitiness”) Teaninich from Alness (for “perfume”) and Dalliuane from Carron (for “meatiness” or weight) – all Highland malts. Alas I haven’t had any of those malts on their own. Someday I will return to Oak Cross after sampling its components for a fun exercise in deconstructing the blend – also a good idea for a tasting party!Nose Honeyed with bold notes of ground cloves fresh vanilla bean yeasty bread and a distant whiff of rooty earthy peat.Palate Soft and shy at first. Spice notes awaken echoing the clove but adding cinnamon and black pepper. Dried ginger rounds out the spices but clashes somewhat with them.Finish Peppery and drying and of medium length. A smudge of fresh soil a dash of toasting spices a twist of something bitter and herbal.With Water Crystallized ginger. A bit maltier on the nose and the palate which brings out a coating of caramel and helps to tame the spiciness. It’s better on the whole with water although the interesting uniqueness of the clove notes get lost.Overall For once the marketing babble hits a tasting note square on a heady mix of perfumy vanilla and spicy ground cloves! Oak Cross reads like a scholarly essay on the effects of different woods on whisky with a lot of technical detail and passion for the subject. Alas the effect of such varied spice notes – sometimes clashing – is to shake up my palate and force me to analyze each distinct element without allowing me to appreciate the integrated whole. With Oak Cross there is a lot of flavor but not a lot of coherency.I desperately hope that John Glaser never reads this review because I have nothing but the utmost respect for his abilities – see my thoughts on his Great King Street and Hedonism. Unfortunately Oak Cross just didn’t gel for me. The individual notes are interesting – truly the first time I’ve identified clove notes so clearly – but they do not combine harmoniously. While I would recommend anyone interested in the alchemy of wood and spirit give this dram a serious contemplation I can’t suggest buying a bottle untasted.
122,Concannon Blended Irish Whiskey - Cooley has a good name in the very-limited Irish whiskey market. Standing for independence and craftsmanship against the stolid industrialism of its sole competitor Irish Distillers1 its banner has been flown fervently by whiskey lovers everywhere and held up as proof of a new dawn in the venerable Irish whiskey tradition.Unfortunately for those of us who value this type of craftsmanship in the face of adversity Cooley hasn’t really been standing out in the news lately. IDL’s resurrection of the Green Spot (and now Yellow Spot) single-pot-still whiskeys and its wild success with the similar Redbreast (which I adore) along with several noteworthy and prize-winning special releases have dimmed the Cooley spotlight. Alas my experience with a bottle of Concannon Irish Whiskey (distilled at Cooley) has not reinforced my positive opinion of the company.Concannon is a “blend” of whiskey aged at least 4 years inside ex-bourbon barrels where some of that whisky was aged a further four months (or so) in barrels that previously held Concannon California Petite Syrah red wine. These barrels had been shipped from California to Ireland. ‘Blend’ in this case refers to a combination of Cooley single-malt Irish Whiskey with column-still grain whiskey. This makes it closer in style to scotch blended whiskey since the typical blended Irish whiskey (such as Jameson Powers or Paddy’s) is a blend of single-pot-still whiskey (like Redbreast) with column-still grain whiskey. The price is certainly right I picked up my bottle for $19.Nose Mildly winey with sour red raspberries red grape skins and an unfortunate waft of antiseptic. Minimum nose tickle. Under the sour fruits is a layer of soft cereal grains and vanilla cake frosting. Overall the aroma is inoffensive but not outstanding.Palate Thin watery body. Somewhat more burn than I’d expect from a 40% ABV product. Wine influence is not apparent. Vaguely grain-like. Bland.Finish Medium-length. Warming but thin. A hint of the red grape skins returns and a bit of vanilla oakiness which fades leaving very little bitterness from the barrel – a plus.With Water Usually it’s not a good idea to add water to a 40% ABV dram. Here it adds some very mild florals to the nose but washes out what little flavor there was. On the upside it becomes particularly “smooth” (whatever that means) and easy to drink. A bland cocktail but much better than some cheap whiskeys that get far worse with water. Worth a try with water for experimentation’s sake.Overall It seems odd to me to take a measure of substandard Cooley whiskey and make the effort to age it in wine barrels. I have to wonder if this was an attempt to save some particularly uninteresting barrels of whiskey? The underlying spirit here is far less interesting than Tyrconnell and Connemara (which are admittedly single-malts) and even the Trader Joe’s Single Malt Irish Whiskey. The conclusion I have to reach here is that Cooley’s 4 year-old blended whiskey (or at least some portion of it) is not worthy of much attention. The syrah barrels do serve to elevate it somewhat – particularly on the nose – but are not able to mask the blandness of the whiskey. Perhaps more time in-barrel or a larger proportion of the wine-barrel-aged liquid in the vat would have made it more successful. One can certainly enjoy this straight which makes it a little better than bottom-shelf Irish blends. If nothing else this is a very inexpensive way to get some vaguely interesting Irish whiskey.1 Technically Bushmills (owned by Diageo) is also competition.
123,Connemara (12 year) - Connemara was introduced to the world during the early stages of the current whisky boom when independent Davids were taking on stagnant industry Goliaths to great success and international renown and boundaries and envelopes were being pushed with every release. Ahh the halcyon days of 2010. Even though every stone in the whisky world has been turned over since then Connemara remains the only peated Irish whiskey. It is also rare in that it is double-distilled (not triple like many Irish whiskies) and a single malt. The brand consists of an entry-level NAS “Connemara Peated” this 12 year-old and a cask-strength NAS edition. Connemara and the Kilbeggan Distillery (formerly Cooley) are now owned by Beam Suntory. Ahh how the underdogs have been slurped up by the industry titans a sort of Saturn Devouring His Children played out in the whisky industry. There’s an image for you.Connemara is named after a defunct Irish distillery and the whiskey is produced as all Irish whiskey (and Scottish) would have been before the advent of drum maltings with peat fires. Connemara is reportedly peated at around half the phenol ppm of Islay malt rendering it milder. There is some confusion about the source of Connemara’s peat. Despite there being peat bogs in the Connemara area of Ireland some Internet sources claim that the peat is sourced from Scotland or Wales. My personal opinion is that if the peat were sourced from Ireland it would be plastered all over the website. That implies the company is embarrassed about the source of their peat and you can read into that what you will.The color of the whiskey like most peated Scottish single malts is very pale.Nose Green vegetal peat. This is just how I imagine smoked cucumber would smell if such a thing existed. The peat smells like it was composed entirely of green leafy things decomposed in inland bogs (no sea notes). Lime peel. Watery.Palate Medium-bodied. Light malt with fresh tobacco leaf birch beer and loads of black pepper. No off-notes but austere.Finish Long. Vanilla. Earthy meaty peat finally with notes of roasted mushrooms and tofu. Mild cake-dough cereal note. No bitterness.With Water A few drops of water intensifies the cucumber note and adds a thin layer of vanilla sweetness to the palate. Water doesn’t hurt here.Overall Not in the same category as peated Islay malts in this price range which have depth of flavor and complexity beyond what this Connemara can reach. Still it is an interesting take on a peated single malt and is well-crafted without bitterness or off-notes. Notable for its individuality among the Irish category but not something that your average malt-head will choose over an Islay malt like Lagavulin 16 Laphroaig 10 or Caol Ila 12.I’m marking this one Recommended with some reservations It’s well-made but not cheap. It’s peated but mildly so. It’s a milestone and outlier in Irish whiskey but the proof is in the glass. If you like your peat on the milder side this is definitely worth a look. $70 though? I’m not sold.
124,Copper Dog - I’m usually a fan of blended malts. Despite being an awkward little-known category that’s hard to explain to newbies blended malts fix a lot of what’s wrong with blended scotch. By removing the cheapest lowest-quality ingredient (usually barely minimum aged (3 years) grain whisky) but keeping the creative and balancing act of skillful blending a carefully-made blended malt can be ethereal and also superior to more-lauded single malts. Just look at Compass Box for examples. Sometimes though the script is flipped and that inexpensive grain whisky is simply replaced by similarly-wretched 3 year-old single malt sourced from the budget secondary market. The proof is usually found in the price as the only reason to add budget malt to a blended malt is to keep the price down to entice customers used to paying bottom-dollar for blended scotch. OK that’s not the only reason but the exception (a high-quality ready-to-drink cask at or near 3 years old) is so rare it’s not worth arguing about.Copper Dog is a blend of 8 single malt scotch whiskies all from the Speyside region of Scotland. It is produced in association with the pub that shares its name located in the historic Craigellachie Hotel in Speyside. The name of both the whisky and the pub refer to a makeshift device once used by distillery workers to illicitly sample and carry whisky from maturing casks. The whisky has no age statement and is bottled at the legal minimum 40% ABV. There is little information about the source whiskies except that they come from a variety of cask types and are married in ex-bourbon hogsheads. I did find an interview that revealed that Knockando Roseisle and Inchgower are included.Nose Lemony with a strong scent of lemon peel tart – but sweet – malt and not much else.Palate Thin body and quite watery. Lemonade roasted peanuts and toast. A total absence of tongue burn. This would be quite tasty if it weren’t so watered-down and bland.Finish Short. Slightly bitter with a lot of charcoal. This is balanced somewhat by nutty sweet malt… like peanut butter-flavored candies. Fades quickly and abruptly without evolving.With Water Really? Water? Ok I’ll try it for consistency’s sake… A scant few drops of water muddy the previously clear lemon note on the aroma and predictably render the palate even more bland. I suppose there is an additional note of pound cake (or marshmallow?) on the tongue and finish but it’s not worth the extra dilution.Overall Meh. A few nice notes that are belied by a bitter finish and completely washed out by an overeager hand with the bottle-proofing water. I actually checked twice to be sure this wasn’t under 40% ABV. The blending is well-done for a sub-$40 blended malt but I find Monkey Shoulder (which has its detractors I don’t deny) to have much more flavor for the price.
125,Corner Creek Reserve Bourbon - Ahh where we would we be without picturesque-sounding “distilleries” making “prime aged American whiskey” from the “finest quality grains” and offering them to us with labels depicting meandering creeks in pristine mountain valleys? Of course like many bourbons Corner Creek is owned by KBD (Kentucky Bourbon Distillers) and sourced from who-knows-where. The problem I have with this is not in the opaque marketing nor the misdirection and obfuscation… it’s with the fact that if I really truly like the whiskey I cannot be assured that the very next bottle will contain the same whiskey or even whiskey from the same distillery! I know Laphroaig will be made at Laphroaig Buffalo Trace will be made at Buffalo Trace and Redbreast will be made at Midleton. What I don’t know is where Corner Creek will be made next because I don’t know where it’s made now.All that said Corner Creek is actually pretty impressive. At around $27 it’s fruity fresh light and without flaws. That’s more than I can say for most other bourbons under $40 and it’s purportedly 8 years old. The bottle is an odd choice – a wine bottle with a decidedly wine-like label you’d be forgiven for thinking it was actually a bottle of Chardonnay.Note 4/8/2016 A reader commented below that he bought a bottle of Corner Creek and found it very low-quality. Be warned that either the liquid has changed in recent batches or there is variability in the quality control.Nose Fruity and chalky with peach and apricot nectars honeysuckle and other fresh florals and a light airy personality. A bit like Angel’s Envy in that it eschews the heavy oaky tradition of most bourbons for a lighterweight spirit with more finesse.Palate Mid-weight body with an initial syrupy rush of elderflower (like this stuff) backed up by white tea and white peaches young coconut and the barest touch of oak. Some vanilla rounds out the very non-corn-like malty cereal base.Finish On the shorter side with mostly remnants of the palate notes. Some slight charcoal flavors and a fading tinge of cinnamon and menthol.With Water A drop of water seems to drown out the fruits and florals replacing them with maybe a little cinnamon. The palate seems unchanged as does the finish. I would not bother with water here – the bottle proof is perfect.Overall Exceptional for $29 bourbon especially if you prefer a lighter style of whisky with more florals and fruits than woody sugars. Corner Creek Reserve is summer whiskey refreshing almost thirst-quenching in its presentation and arrives at a well-chosen 44% ABV which delivers sparkling flavors without overwhelming the palate.
126,Cragganmore (12 year) - Cragganmore. I had seen the bottle on the shelf at various whisky shops and vaguely knew that it was part of Diageo’s main Classic Malts series representing Speyside. I had never tried it or even heard it talked about. Why would Diageo pick out of the hundreds of prolific and historic sites in the heart of mainland whiskymaking – Speyside – Cragganmore to represent the region? Luckily I got a chance to try the three main distillery bottlings of Cragganmore at a K&L Whisky Tasting recently. Whisky Tastings are such an important way to try new whiskies and expand one’s horizons. I wish they were more prevalent in the U.S.Cragganmore is also the principal malt used in Diageo’s wildly popular blend Johnnie Walker Black Label providing the gentle malt base. The distillery-released 12 year-old comes exclusively from 2nd-fill bourbon casks to reduce the woodiness imparted by long aging in first-fill barrels. At $44 a bottle this isn’t a bad deal and is worth considering against similar ex-bourbon-cask malts like Glenfiddich 15-year Glenmorangie 10-year and Oban 14-year.Nose Pale hay – indeed it smells like Johnnie Walker Black Label! (Imagine that). Very light… a bit of ground peanuts?Palate Hazelnut and milk chocolate. Peanut butter lavender floral honey.Finish Sweet processed honey. Nice oak tannins small bitter note. Trails off with hazelnut skins.Overall Mild and inoffensive. No smoke no fruit just a soft cereal character and light accents of florals and nuts. Somewhat meaty although the flavor profile is mostly balanced around the nuts. Certainly worth the money and a contender for the “midrange Speyside” spot in your cabinet – especially if you like nuttier flavors instead of Speyside’s more-common honey apple and heather style. I do wish Diageo would bottle this at 43% and without chill-filtration. The added body would really complement the nuttiness.
127,Cragganmore (21 year) - Whisky ages on a continuum. It starts out clear rough and vibrant. First it turns fruity nutty and sweet. It then matures into smooth elegant and condensed. Finally it dies woody musty and rancid. The goal of any bottling company (independent or owned by the distillery) is to pick the right spot to freeze a whisky in time by bottling it airless in a glass bottle. Whether 3 8 or 50 years old every bottled whisky lies somewhere between these two extremes. When a whisky goes into a barrel nobody knows what it will taste like when it matures fully or how long it will take. A whisky that “matures” completely in three years in the hot humid climate of Bangalore India might otherwise have taken 20 years in cool windy Scotland.Whisky marketing over the past three decades has taught us that “older is pricier” and “pricier is better” therefore (logically) “older is better”. Don’t believe the spin. While it’s true that older is generally pricier (due to the costs associated with warehousing barrels for long periods of time plus the loss of whisky due to evaporation) age alone by no means determines quality. Here unfortunately is a cautionary example.While I very much enjoyed Cragganmore’s 12 year old distillery bottling and especially their port-finished Distiller’s Edition the 21 year-old distillery bottling that I tried at a recent K&L Whisky Tasting was truly disappointing. This whisky distilled in 1989 and put into the bottle in 2010 reflects 21 years of aging in 2nd- and 3rd-fill American oak (ex-Bourbon) barrels. It is bottled at 56% ABV (which was cask strength after all that evaporation). The batch made only 5856 bottles. It retails for *gasp* $200 although it can be found for as little as $160. Is it worth the astounding price? Nose Overripe banana skins pine sap fresh chive flowers.Palate Grape skins (grappa) and a bit thin on the tongue. How can a 21 year-old be watery? Florals develop later and spearmint. Green moss.Finish Heather. Nice raw concentrated honey. Light and airy.With Water A spicier hint of Grappa juicy pear and more banana. The finish acquires some coconut tropical fruit and pine.Overall Well is this worth the money? No. It’s just OK. It’s certainly smooth but what used to be vibrant is now limp. Where there were nuts and chocolate there is now composting banana peels (you know the smell I’m talking about) and some stale coconut. The only major redeeming feature is the lack of the heavy wood you might expect in something this old (likely due to the use of much-used barrels). Spend your money on The Macallan 18 which has aged gracefully or on several bottles of younger spirit. In this case older is not better at least not in my opinion.
128,Cragganmore 1992 Distiller’s Edition - Say what you will about Diageo the giant monolithic overlord of scotch whisky they understand that people want variety in their malts. Each of the distillery’s Classic Malts series includes a “Distiller’s Edition” bottling which is finished in interesting casks that complement each whisky’s house style. While slightly smaller producers like Ardbeg Glenmorangie and Springbank run circles around this practice (releasing multiple interesting finishes yearly) Diageo maintains that with its massive volume only production runs consisting of at least hundreds of barrels are worth its time.Speysider Cragganmore (see my review of the distillery’s 12 year-old bottling here) with a chocolatey/nutty house style pairs perfectly with a sweet fruity ruby port finish in this yearly release. At around 13 years of age (this bottle was distilled in 1992 and bottled in 2005) only 300 casks per year are filled into emptied Sandeman’s Ruby port pipes – made of Spanish oak – to finish for 6-18 months. The result is like a chocolate cherry cordial both sweet and nutty and now I’m making myself hungry…Nose Currants. Black licorice wood notes vanilla extract? Sticky sun-drying plums.Palate There’s the port! Acidic and winey. Red wine and balsamic vinegar. Juicy green grapes. Sweet like a chocolate cherry cordial.Finish Ripe muscat grapes anise and nutmeg. The finish is a bit dry… not so much of grape but jam or tannin-y pressed grape skins.Overall Very interesting. You don’t see a port finish every day and this one is certainly one to ponder. I wish it had been bottled at a bit higher than 40% ABV. It’s on the pricey side but might be worth it if port finishes are your thing (see Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban for a cheaper alternative although I’ve been told it’s too cloying). Certainly something worth trying.
129,Craigellachie (13 year) - I do a lot of the tastings for this blog based on samples that I’ve purchased from either Master of Malt (although not since they were purchased by AB InBev and stopped shipping to the US) or Flaviar. So many in fact that I often end up with a big backlog of samples that quickly go obsolete. One benefit to tasting from sample bottles is that I have no preconceived notions about the full bottle price while I’m tasting. This frees me from expecting too much (or too little). When I write up the tasting notes I like to try and guess the price and it should be no surprise that I’m almost always on the cheaper end of the range when I do this. It’s probably because my brain is anchored to prices from back in the early 2010s and now I say stuff like “Back in my day Macallan 18 was $80 a bottle!” We also walked uphill in the snow both ways to school.This official bottling (one of three from the distillery including a 17-year and a 23-year all new in 2014 after Bacardi assumed ownership) comes from a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks and is bottled at 46% ABV without added coloring and without chill filtration.I’ve only reviewed one other Craigellachie so I don’t have much of a point of reference. Both times it has appeared to me to be a middle-weight Speysider with a decent balance of fruit and caramel notes that is otherwise forgettable.Nose Potent spike of caramel sweetness with oaky vanilla overtones. There isn’t a lot of additional complexity – just various shades of wood and malty sugars. After a rest in the glass some ripe banana notes creep in.Palate Medium body. An initial wave of banana and toffee is accompanied by a very mild tongue burn. Then slightly bitter and slightly smoky barrel char oak chips and burnt caramel.Finish On the short side. A very consistent finish comprising the good notes from the nose and palate but without much bitterness. Unfortunately it fades quickly without evolving.With Water A few drops of water release a nice orange peel note which merges well with the caramel. The palate seems thinner the finish livelier. Water is a good idea with this malt.Overall A fairly one-dimensional malt that is somewhat marred by my least-favorite flavor note (banana). The wood is nice as are the well-balanced sugar notes that verge on toasty toffee and caramel but there isn’t much else to recommend it.Tasting price-blind I said I would be hesitant to pay more than $35 for this. Now that I see it retails for $48+ I’d call that a “Try Before Buy” kind of situation unless you see a screaming deal. Upon further reading I wonder if the famous sulphur note that everyone says is a hallmark of Craigellachie might be hitting my jaded senses as banana. That will require more investigation…
130,Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye - Crown… What can I say about Crown? I’ve never done a review of the basic blended whisky (the one in the purple bag) because my mother always said “If you can’t say anything nice don’t say anything at all.” I have tried the Special Reserve and thought it was “just OK” and maybe a little too sweet. Still generally when I think of Crown it’s not as a serious whisky worthy of serious contemplation. I think of it as something that people dump in their Coke because it sounds fancy.Then along comes much-maligned Whisky Bible author Jim Murray whose 2016 edition of the bible awarded Crown Royal’s Northern Harvest Rye release a whopping 97.5 points and the shelf-clearing title of “World Whisky of the Year”. This caused the predictable explosion of indignation in the blogosphere (I don’t get to use that word nearly often enough) and social media and the also-predictable frenzy in print and online media. The first group wanted to know how a $25 Canadian whisky (a Crown no less) possibly could be the best whisky in the world. They concluded that Jim is a highly-paid industry shill stirring the pot for the sake of attention-grabbing headlines or just screwing with everybody for the lulz. The second group started madly printing giddy headlines like “Scots left reeling as Canadian whisky named world’s best” (Telegraph) and “The Best Whiskey in the World Is Canadian” (Forbes). My theory is that (although misrepresented in the book) Jim’s “World Whisky of the Year” spot is really intended to be more of a “Most Under-Appreciated Whisky of the Year” award. I think he misrepresents that fact for the aforementioned headlines. Controversy sells almost as much as sex does.So how is the best whisky in the world? It’s decent. It’s a hundred steps up from the basic Crown Royal and has a fantastic price point but it’s really just a tasty bottle of blended Canadian whisky. Lot 40 (which later won the 2016 Canadian Whisky of the Year award from the people whose opinion on Canadian whisky you should probably actually trust… Canadians) is an order of magnitude better.The Northern Harvest Rye bottling itself is a blended Canadian whisky comprising a high percentage (90%) of rye. (Most Canadian whisky contains rye to some extent.) The packaging claims the rye used is from fields that over-winter under cover of snow which we’re expected to believe leads to smoother whisky. The result is bottled at 45% ABV. That’s pretty much all Crown has revealed. Oh and it comes with a cute little beige cloth drawstring bag. So am I about to taste the world’s best whiskey?Nose A very pleasant green apple and pear -filled aroma. Light and fragrant with some nondescript flowers soft grains nougat and an aroma I can only describe as circus peanuts.Palate Medium bodied. Banana candy (Runts) marshmallows nutmeg mulled cider and faint oak. No burn to speak of (“smooth”).Finish Medium-long. Red apple skins mouth-drying tannins fading without bitterness.With Water A few drops of water bring out some vanilla in the aroma and make the finish a little fruitier. I could take or leave water with this.Overall An inoffensive whisky without the usual rye flavors (there’s no cinnamon no clove no eucalyptus/mint) but with a plethora of nostalgia-inducing fruit and candy flavors. Unlike the standard Crown Royal I do not detect any “fake” corn-syrup-like notes nor any young column-still grainy characteristics (acetone). This is not too sweet not too spicy and scary easy to drink. I certainly wouldn’t call this the best whisky of 2016 or even the best Canadian whisky I’ve had but it is a good blended rye at a fantastic price and I’m looking forward to the remaining 700mls in the bottle. My award? “2016 Best Effort To Improve Its Reputation by a Mass-Market Blended Whisky Producer”. Headlines here I come!
131,Crown Royal Reserve Canadian Whisky - Ok so here’s the thing about Canadian whisky. Laws about what constitutes “Canadian Whisky” are somewhat less strict than those for say bourbon or scotch. The law allows “blended Canadian Whisky” to contain either column-still or pot-still whisky distilled from a mash of grains including corn rye barley and wheat. It must be distilled and aged in Canada. It may contain spirit caramel for coloring and it may contain flavoring ingredients. It must be aged for at least three years in oak barrels which can be new or refill. Canadian whisky can contain high-proof neutral grain spirits in amounts as high as 90% of volume unless they are sold in the United States where at least 20% by volume must be “straight whiskey”.The concern for whisky lovers is that “flavoring ingredients” line which basically allows Canadian whisky producers to sweeten their products using caramel sugar or other ingredients without disclosing them on the label. This is not to say that all producers do this in fact it’s likely that Crown Royal does not but owner Diageo is not very specific about its operations. For example while the website claims that Crown Royal is a “blend of 50 distinct Canadian whiskies” due to corporate consolidation during the period when CR was owned by Seagram all production of these whiskies was combined at the large Crown Royal plant at Gimli in Manitoba. Do they produce 50 “distinct” recipes of whisky at this plant and then blend them? I doubt it.The primary difference between a Canadian blended whisky and other blended whiskies on the market is that Canadian whisky is generally lighter in style and usually has a higher percentage of “neutral” grain spirit in the blend. Some newer craft and small-scale producers of Canadian whisky – foremost among them Forty Creek – have been rescuing the reputation of Canadian whisky with carefully-crafted high-quality spirits. It should be noted that a large amount of Canadian whisky (and probably the best of the stuff) is not exported outside of the country.Crown Royal Reserve is simply a blend of Crown Royal that contains a higher percentage of longer-aged and hand-selected casks. It was first released as “Special Reserve” but Diageo dropped the “Special” and updated the label in 2008.Nose Some Rye spiciness with soft overtones of brown sugar and maple syrup. Slightly bourbon-like although not as robust.Palate Thin body. Maple again. A bit watery. Slightly woody slightly sweet.Finish Nutty but with a twinge of bitterness. Aftertaste of artificial sweeteners.With Water Too watery. Even a little bit of water kills the nose and washes out the palate.With Ice An ice cube sweetens it but dilutes the flavor. As with most iced whiskeys do this only if you dislike the flavor of straight whiskey.Overall Not objectionable. The flavors are mild. It tastes a bit like an American rye but watered down and sweetened. Possibly not worth the money unless you already love Crown Royal and want a direct upgrade. If you are looking to experiment with Canadian whiskies I would suggest starting with Forty Creek instead.
132,Cut Spike Nebraska Single Malt (2 year) - I’ve tasted enough whisky now to be relatively jaded when trying new bottles. “Mild sherry influence” I think or “mediocre ex-bourbon” or “run-of-the-mill high-rye bourbon.” I relegate new bottles to a handful of Old Curmudgeon categories like “OK for cocktails I guess” and “Could buy it if they’re out of Rittenhouse” or “Slightly better than other sub-$30 blends” or “Pretty good but way overpriced.” You laugh because it’s true. I’m the “Scotch Snob” now apparently and it shows. Imagine my surprise then when I tasted Cut Spike a single-malt whiskey from – of all places – Nebraska. Yes you read that correctly it’s a bottle of fine two year-old Nebraska Single Malt. I can hear the snorts of derision from here. You can quit laughing. This whisky opened my eyes in a way that hasn’t happened since I-don’t-know-when. It’s amazing.We whisky bloggers try to avoid the word ‘smooth’. It’s the kind of thing that frat guys say to impress each other while choking down shots of Jack Daniels. “Smooth” implies that the alcohol isn’t prominent which can be achieved with any spirit by adding water to lower its ABV. I struggle then to find a word to describe Cut Spike. Silky? Round? Screw it. This stuff is SMOOTH in a way that no vodka or blended scotch could ever be. It rolls around your tongue soft and intensely flavored without so much as a hint of burning.The fact that Cut Spike is only two years of age is astounding – in a blind test I would have said 12 at least but more likely 18. This can be attributed in part to the use of charred new oak barrels (a la bourbon) which is a rare to nonexistent practice with whisky made from malted barley. Cut Spike is a micro-distillery in La Vista Nebraska. They use mostly domestic barley malt and do a 5-day ferment with brewer’s yeast and limestone-rich Nebraska water. The wash is distilled in a pair of copper pot stills (300 and 500 gallons) with a small heart cut. The wood is all new charred American oak but they use several different char levels to coax different effects from the wood.The whiskey is an odd ruddy brownish tinge. Dark like a bourbon but without the sparkling topaz color. According to Cut Spike they do not add any coloring agents to the whiskey. They also do not chill-filter. My bottle is from Batch 001 bottled 8/1/2013. Bottled after two years in oak at 43% ABV.Updated 3/27/2021 I tasted a small sample of the second batch of Cut Spike at a blind tasting event this week so please scroll to the bottom and check my results if you’re considering buying something other than Batch 1.Nose Intensely sweet butterscotch and toffee. If a nose can do a double-take mine just did. This doesn’t smell like 2 year-old paint thinner in wood this smells like deeply mature malt whisky with a lot of oak influence. Vanilla fudge white chocolate and “blondie” brownies. Deeper in there’s a faint sappy green wood like freshly-snapped saplings. Sweet and flawless. Wow.Palate Soft and supple. Maple sugar candies! A reprise of the aroma but with endless waves of bakery treats caramels vanilla and a whallop of oak tannin. Is it malt whisky? Is it bourbon? Somehow it’s the best of both. No tongue burn to speak of.Finish Medium/Short. The sweet notes drop away quickly leaving a little drying tannin and some faint herbal flavors like mint or menthol. No bitterness.With Water At 43% ABV this is hardly crying out for water. A few drops seem to (oddly) dampen the sweetness and add only a hint of charcoal. On the tongue the water seems to draw up tannins and even a little bitterness. I don’t see any need for water here.Overall Unreal. Who knew that if you took Nebraska water malted barley and new charred American oak you could make magic? And in only two years! I was hooked at first sip and now halfway through the bottle I can’t believe I ever lived without it. Cut Spike has exactly the right amount of wood character – aging this any longer under the same conditions could make for an overly woody muddied mess. 43% ABV seems perfect for mouthfeel body intensity of flavor and lack of burn. It has less harsh acrid notes than most bourbons and more flavor than most malt whiskies aged in reused wood. There is no hint of acetone or vodka-like flavors despite the young age. It is perhaps a little on the sweet side for those who prefer drier spirits and the finish seems a little lightweight. Those are nitpicks though. This is easily the best American spirit I’ve had short of Pappy 15 (which is a wholly entirely different whiskey) and among the best malt whiskies I’ve had. Considering that the malt whisky category encompasses all of single-malt scotch that’s saying something.Batch 2 Notes I did not have enough liquid to perform a full review so I thought I’d add some notes here for people looking in the store at a “batch 2” of Cut Spike. Batch 2 is wildly different – night and day – from batch 1. It features a dominant soapy perfume note of lavender dish soap sweet and tart tropical fruits (passion fruit exotic citrus) a syrupy body and a cloyingly-sweet cotton candy bubblegum flavor on the palate. There is almost no hint of oak at all let alone new oak and basically none of the “baked sugar” notes survive from batch 1. It was widely hated by the tasting participants. I heard through the grapevine that Cut Spike’s master distiller wanted to change the recipe after batch 1 which explains why it is different. I would not buy a bottle of Batch 2 and my admiration for the distillery has been damaged. I would only buy a bottle of future batches if I had an opportunity to taste them first. “Fool me once…”
133,Cutty Sark (12 year) Blended Scotch - Hey look it’s almost 2019. What better way I think to ring in the New Year than to reconfirm what a salty bastard I’ve become and review something that is sure to raise the ire of anyone who’s been drinking whisky longer than I’ve been alive? I’m really hoping someone calls me a “whippersnapper” in the comments. After trying really hard to like Cutty Sark’s baseline blended scotch (in which I suggest readers don’t try to smell the whisky) I deluded myself into thinking maybe a sample of the 12 year-old would go over better. I mean half of the problem with inexpensive blended scotches is that they routinely use a high proportion of bottom-dollar (and minimum legal age at 3 years of maturation) grain whisky. So the theory goes if you restrict the blend to only 12 year-and-up components that eliminates the problem right?Right?Cutty 12 is weirdly hard to find online. It’s either undergoing a revamp (so everyone is sold out) or the distribution is limited due to… I don’t know… an attempt to drum up demand via scarcity? Whatever the reason you’re not missing out if you can’t find it. Oops. Spoilers.For something significantly better without paying more Cutty Sark Prohibition Edition is actually quite nice.Nose Weirdly barnyard-y (soiled hay) right out of the bottle. This reminds me immediately of Sheep Dip with all the associated negative connotations. A rest in the glass does little to relieve this but does add a little sweetness for balance. Yes now it smells like sweet sheep crap. To be fair there is also a nice grapey note in there – like sweet white wine or fresh green grapes.Palate Medium bodied almost syrupy. Very sweet with cloying taffy bright red maraschino cherry and assorted bakery sweets. Not much dimension but boy does this deliver on the sugar.Finish Short. A welcome hint of something nutty – hazelnut? – and a wash of bitterness. Slightly mouth-drying.With Water A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma (a good thing?) and require yet another rest to reveal some toffee and butterscotch. The palate is (even) sweeter as in pure white sugar and simple syrup. Skip water here.Overall Ok it’s not awful but the additional 9 years (I kid) of aging has not made this into something special. It might have added some oaky sweetness and a little hazelnut to the palate and it might also have rounded off some rough edges but it remains mass-produced blended scotch.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. These large blended scotch brands have gotten where they are by low prices marketing and bulk production efficiency not by flavor. I contend that the vast majority of Cutty drinkers (or JW Red or Grouse or Chivas or J&B or…) would have chosen a different brand if they’d been exposed to better options when they first tried it. Now they’ve “acquired a taste” for the assorted off-flavors and weird esters that are a result of making scotch as cheaply as possible and many will defend it until their dying breath. That joke about sheep crap was uncalled-for and I’m about to hear about it in 3… 2… 1…
134,Cutty Sark Blended Scotch - These days every time I turn around the price of an old standby goes up. I can’t get Laphroaig 10 for $31 anymore or Balvenie DoubleWood for $34 or GlenDronach 12 for $40. Across the board prices on single malts have risen by between 2% and 20% in the last year. Whisky boom indeed – it’s times like these that a resourceful noob turns to rediscover cheaper alternatives.So how about some airplane whisky? Cutty Sark is one of those run-of-the-mill blends that happens to be on every bar counter well everywhere. Born in 1923 as a Berry Bros. & Rudd blend to sell to their wine-loving clientele the blend was reputedly the first to eschew caramel coloring in favor of a natural pale coloring. As it’s primarily young whisky aged in American oak it takes on very little cask coloring and is notably paler than most scotch on the market blends or otherwise. The brand is now owned by Edrington Group who also sell Famous Grouse and own both Macallan and Highland Park distilleries.The malts in Cutty Sark are “mostly Speyside” according to the website. I do wish these companies would release more information on the components of their blends. While most bar-goers don’t care – I might be more inclined to sip on a cheap blend if I knew that its primary malt ingredient was something I’m familiar with and enjoy. A little Internet research reveals that among others Cutty Sark contains some Macallan Highland Park Glenrothes Tamdhu Bunnahabhain and Glengoyne.Nose Getting past the waft of nail polish remover there is some nice vanilla peach pit and lemon sorbet. There’s also an odd compost-y scent like molding fruit. Eugh.Palate Medium-bodied. Relatively low tongue burn. Middling notes of toffee and apricot jam and a nice milk chocolate chaser. Really not too bad.Finish Short finish. Milk chocolate again and mild nuts. The nuts turn somewhat bitter as they fade.With Water A healthy splash of water does nothing to help the nose. The palate is sweetened and the finish becomes if anything more bitter. Stick with ice or mixers since water is no improvement.Overall Well aside from that obnoxious rotting vegetation odor it’s not that bad. The milk chocolate notes are impressive and while the blend isn’t complex it’s not offensive to the palate. Just don’t… er… smell it. At any rate if you’re digging this deep to find affordable whisky you may as well be putting it on ice or mixing it. It’s hard to imagine sitting back in an overstuffed chair with a snifter of this and actually enjoying it. The search continues…
135,Cutty Sark Prohibition Edition Blended Scotch - Ok so I am not a Cutty Sark fan. In fact it could be argued that I’m not much of a friend to the category of blended scotch in general. (This would a false argument as I have repeatedly championed gems such as Bank Note 5 year and Great King Street Artist’s Blend.) Still I’m a sucker for a bottle that I’ve never tasted before and so I snagged a 30ml sample of the well-publicized Cutty Sark Prohibition Edition in my last (and likely final) Master of Malt samples order.Prohibition Edition sounds like what it is a transparent attempt to cast a pallor of history over an unabashedly modern product. It was first released in 2013 to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the repeal of the prohibition of alcohol in the United States. The cynics among you will wonder why a Scottish whisky is celebrating an American historical event or why the 80th year is more worthy of celebration than say the 75th. Or the 90th. I have no answer except the tenuous link between the brand (named after the Cutty Sark a British tea clipper) and the famous captain Bill McCoy (as in “The Real”) who smuggled illicit Cutty Sark whiskey into the States during the years of Prohibition. I guess.At any rate Cutty Prohibition is bottled at the robust (and unusual for a blend) strength of 50% ABV and supposedly has a different blend of grains and malts than the typical Cutty Sark bottle. Some of the components were aged in “American Sherry” barrels otherwise known as ex-bourbon casks that temporarily held sherry a practice known as “seasoning”. That’s all we know because large scotch companies are even less forthcoming about their blends than they are about their single malts.Nose Smells like Cutty. Wet cardboard mild oaky sugars slightly earthy. Good nose tickle not too hot for 50% ABV. A rest in the glass does nothing to improve the reticent aroma.Palate Thin body. Very sweet upfront with dense toffee soft caramel and vanilla saltwater taffy. A moderate tongue burn not as hot as 50% would imply. Not much evolution on the tongue although some of the sugar notes evolve into woody/oaky ones which gives a nice balance and prevents it from becoming cloying.Finish Medium length. Warming with a reprise of the caramelized sugar notes from the palate. After these fade there is a suggestion of mint and very little charcoal and almost no bitterness.With Water A few drops of water don’t help the aroma… if anything it’s even more inert now. The water thins the body and muddies the sweet notes. Water is optional here. I would skip it.Overall Aside from the lackluster aroma this is shockingly good for an inexpensive blended scotch. The density of sweet flavors on the palate remind me of Bank Note 5 year and they come together without much in the way of off flavors. The finish is even less bitter than Bank Note and quite successful for a blend.I like Bank Note just a little bit more (it has a better aroma and an age statement) and I like this far more than the Cutty Sark 12-year but don’t let the Cutty name put you off – this is some pretty damn tasty blended scotch for only $15 – $20 a bottle. I wouldn’t pay more than that though. Note that there seems to be a rash of retailers offering this for $30+. It is definitely not worth that. K&L Wines in Redwood City CA has it for $15 a bottle and has for awhile.I gave this a (probably) controversial “Must Try” rating not because I think you must try it but because it’s a good specimen that proves that even inexpensive mass-market blended scotch can be good. If you think blended scotch is beneath you then you “Must” try this (and Bank Note).
136,Dad’s Hat Rye - It’s funny how place influences whisky. I’m not talking about terroir or region of origin I’m talking about how sometimes the place where you enjoy a certain whisky can affect your perception of it. Whisky wine and food writers alike all wax poetic about this phenomenon and it usually takes the form of a wistful soliloquy about sand between your toes or back-slapping camaraderie. I personally have a fondness for Sol beer after a trip with college buddies to Mexico found me dragging my sun-bleached sweat-drenched weary corpse to the nearest restaurant to bask in the glory of (several) ice-cold Sols and locally-caught marlin tostadas. Whenever I open a Sol (which is basically the Michelob to Mexico’s Bud Light Corona) I’m back in Mexico young and invincible and eating those $2 tostadas again.This year on a trip to visit the battlefield at Gettysburg (my first time) I dashed to the local state-run liquor store arriving a few minutes before closing to secure booze for a week that promised a lot of walking around in the sun and looking at monuments. I spied a bottle of Dad’s Hat Pennsyvania Rye and figured why not choose a local whiskey? It wasn’t the best whiskey I’ve ever had nor the best rye. But if necessity is the mother of invention then desperation might just be the mother of the best damn whisky sour I have ever made. Maybe it was my vacation mentality or maybe it was squeezing lemons with the back of a kitchen knife in some AirBnb kitchen or making simple syrup out of a half-full bear-shaped bottle of honey and tap water… whatever it was I have never been able to replicate those Dad’s Hat Whisky Sours since I’ve returned home. Ah well at least we’ll always have Gettysburg.Dad’s Hat is a craft Pennsylvania rye made by Mountain Laurel Spirits LLC at the Grundy Mill Distillery in Bristol PA. A locally-sourced mashbill of 80% rye 15% malted barley and 5% malted rye is distilled and then aged for six months in new charred oak quarter casks. There’s some uncertainty about whether Dad’s Hat “counts” as Monongahela rye that extinct style of rye that once dominated the US rye whiskey market. Bristol is in eastern Pennsylvania (not western PA where the Monongahela river runs) and Dad’s Hat co-founder Herman Mihalich has stated that the brand is looking for flavor over authenticity. That said Dad’s Hat uses a combination of malted and unmalted rye which is one of the traditions that marked the Monongahela rye style.Dad’s Hat also now produces a Straight Rye a Bonded Straight Rye and port- and vermouth-finished editions with more on the horizon.Nose Rye! Grassy and explosive with a healthy dollop of tropical fruit (I can’t tell… pineapple? Coconut?) a woodsy pine/eucalyptus note which seems to be the hallmark of young rye and a dry herbal kick of something like anise or fennel.Palate Medium-heavy body slightly chewy. A heavy dose of spice cabinet primarily cinnamon and clove which come across as fresh not dusty. Slightly bitter vegetal notes pervade the midpalate like green peppercorn and mown grass. At first this appears original and inventive but then quickly betrays the youth of the spirit.Finish Medium in length. The pine notes return as does the grass. A ghostly note of caraway comes and goes and the whole fades with cinnamon now stale.With Water Several drops of water amp up the grassy notes alas covering up some of the fruit. The palate becomes sweeter – cinnamon rolls – and brings out menthol on the finish. Try both with and without water.Overall A rough-and-ready craft rye with a perfectly-chosen ABV an eclectic but coherent array of rye aromas and flavors and a few surprises. The grassy youth of the rye comes through like light through a tattered window curtain sometimes marring the experience. Man would this be good with a few more years on it.Note This makes an unexpectedly tasty whiskey sour where the sugar and lemon provide an excellent foil for the herbal and spicy notes and manage to cover up most of the youthful character. If you have a bottle give a whiskey sour a try with it. Try honey syrup instead of white sugar.
137,Dailuaine (16 year) Flora and Fauna - Up until a generous reader (this one) sent me a sample of Dailuaine 16 my experience with the Speyside distillery has been limited to the various Compass Box malts that contain it as a component (Spice Tree and Flaming Heart among others). This isn’t really my fault though as the distillery’s output sees vanishingly small distribution in the US. This bottle purchased at UK retailer The Whisky World in London is from Diageo’s “Flora and Fauna” series of distillery odds and ends that don’t really warrant (in production volume or demand) their own full production lines and brands. The Flora and Fauna release is the closest this distillery gets to an official bottling.Dailuaine is known as a component in Johnnie Walker blends which is where the vast majority of the output from the distillery’s three wash and three spirit stills goes. This particular 16 year-old was matured in ex-sherry casks although I can’t find any details (Full-term maturation? Finish?). Diageo is as usual tight-lipped about production details. Bottled at 43% ABV probably chill-filtered and likely colored.Nose Light sherry notes of the stonefruit variety plum apricot etc. A very slight rancio note (less rancid and more yeasty) that merges nicely with pale buttery oak. Elegant though unsurprising.Palate Medium bodied. A little hot for 43% but resolves quickly into bakery treats (peach tarts?) buttered scones jam and caramelized sugar that is almost cola-like.Finish Of medium length. Classic. Red fruits marzipan and/or almond butter and the slightest charcoal bitterness. Fades a little herby like absinthe without the anise.With Water A few drops of water add a bit more of that yeast note but wash out the rest. Don’t bother with water here 43% is low enough as it is.Overall Exactly in the middle of your expectations for a medium-sherry Highlander at 16 years of age. It would be uncalled-for to call it boring but the word entered my mind more than once while tasting. Really though it’s not boring… it’s just a confidently well-made middle-of-the-road dram that just about anybody should be able to enjoy. If I had to compare it I’d say it was a bit like The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 but not quite as good as the 17 year. I would definitely not be disappointed to pay $60 (after the exchange rate) especially considering how rare Dailuaine is in the States.
138,Dalwhinnie (15 year) - Ironically Dalwhinnie was maybe the 4th or 5th scotch whisky that I tried when I was first introduced to the wonders of single malt but it was at a restaurant with a meal and I never wrote a review. At the time I was reveling in the joys of discovery of peat and sherry and didn’t have time for the simplicity and elegance of a good Highland ex-bourbon malt. Now that I’ve come full-circle I can see what’s admirable about a well-made single malt aged only in ex-bourbon casks. The floral notes combine with the light summer fruits (peaches pears etc.) to create a tantalizing perfume with subtle complexity. Below that the cereal notes of malted barley run crisp and clear and can be appreciated independently of the other notes. In this way with no peat or sherry or wine-cask influence you can perceive the elemental building blocks of single-malt whisky.Dalwhinnie is one of Diageo’s Classic Malts series representing the Highlands (specifically the Central Highlands not including the Speyside region). Regionality has never meant a lot in scotch and the lines are pretty blurred depending on who you’re asking. I think of Dalwhinnie as Speyside in style (light fruity and honeyed) although Diageo classifies it as simply “Highland”.Nose White peach blanched almonds honeycomb and heavy florals – honeysuckle and … I don’t know … “flower shop”. Very pleasant very focused. A rest in the glass drops some of the tart fruits and yields some white chocolate.Palate Medium-full body. Clean cereals (puffed malted barley) with a touch of peat (really more of an earthiness than smoke or real peat). In the background a reprise of the aroma’s fruit-and-flowers routine but overshadowed by the directness of the barley.Finish Short. Marzipan a slight oaky bitterness and faintly fruity. Fades with mouth-drying tannins.With Water A few drops of water increase the amount of fruit on the nose – mostly peach – and actually amplify the slight peatiness on the palate. Try this one both without and then with water.Overall A straightforward but very well-executed malt. This is a quintessential ex-bourbon Highland malt with primary characteristics of summer fruits flowers and honey. It’s very similar to (and cheaper than) The Balvenie Single Barrel 15 year and a little bit lighter in style than Oban 14 but stands up well against any unpeated ex-bourbon malt. If there is a weakness here it’s in the forgettable finish. If you haven’t cemented in your mind what the “taste of the Highlands” is yet this is a Must Try. Even if you have Dalwhinnie 15 serves as a cabinet stalwart.
139,David Nicholson 1843 Bourbon - It seems that spirits company Luxco purveyors of that fine brown liquid in a plastic jug – Rebel Yell – that some of you might remember less-than-fondly from your college years has woken up to the clarion chimes of bourbon demand (only five or six years late) and begun expanding their bourbon portfolio and even opening a new distillery. The Lux Row distillery in Bardstown KY will begin its first spirit run in early January 2018 (so… like… now). Currently Luxco’s brands (Ezra Brooks Rebel Yell David Nicholson and Blood Oath) are sourced from multiple distilleries including Heaven Hill. Production of these brands will move to the new distillery when it is operational.The David Nicholson brand was previously distilled at Stitzel-Weller (don’t get excited it hasn’t contained SW juice for decades) and the 1843 bottling – named after the year grocer David Nicholson began selling his own blend of bourbon at his store in St. Louis – is a wheater in the Stitzel-Weller tradition (corn mashbill flavored with wheat instead of rye). Bottled without an age statement at 100 proof (50% ABV) the 1843 is a Kentucky straight bourbon bottled by Luxco in St. Louis MO… and that’s about all we know. You can find it in the $23 – $30 range.The company also releases a “Reserve” 100 proof bottling which is actually a rye-flavored recipe. Review here.Nose Soft reserved nose. May need a rest in the glass to open up. Corn-forward with some dry dusty whole wheat bread. A stale spice of some kind — cardamom perhaps. Very shy for 100 proof. I was wrong – even a rest does not add interest to the aroma.Palate Medium-bodied. Sweet wheat cakey and accompanied by cherry coulis. Pleasant and not overly hot.Finish Short. A brief impression of mint a reprise of tart cherry and vanilla cake fading to faint oaky dryness. Not bitter.With Water Even a liberal splash of water does nothing for the nose except add a weird rancid peanut-butter note. Water is not helpful with this one.Overall A reserved uninteresting nose belies a very tasty if simple experience on the tongue. Hallmarks of the wheated style (softness vanilla-sweetness) offer no surprises but are markedly well-implemented for such a low price point. I think you’re basically getting a discount on a perfectly serviceable wheated bourbon because of the bland aroma.
140,David Nicholson Reserve 100 Proof Bourbon - Last week I talked about David Nicholson 1843 bourbon and rather than split up a pair of besties I thought I’d continue this week with the David Nicholson Reserve 100 Proof which seems to be attempting to compete with the bottled-in-bond (BIB) market without actually being bottled in bond (a term for whiskey aged in government bonded warehouses originally intended to preserve the integrity of spirits). Like BIB bourbons it is released at 50% ABV (100 proof). Also like BIB bourbons we can assume that if Luxco is adhering to labeling requirements the bourbon – a Kentucky straight bourbon – is at least 4 years of age. Otherwise it would be required to carry an age statement.Although it shares a striking label resemblance to the 1843 line the Reserve uses a rye-flavored mash bill and is not wheated. It’s also sourced from an undisclosed distillery in Kentucky possibly Heaven Hill and bottled by Luxco in St. Louis. Soon however distillation will move to the new Lux Row distillery in Bardstown Kentucky. Expect to pay a $5 premium over the 1843. Let’s see if it’s worth it…Nose Powerfully rye-heavy lots of cherry-infused clove cinnamon stick and mulled wine. Somewhat sharp and spirity at 50% ABV. Medium-sweet with some light caramelized sugars and an oaky undertone.Palate Thin body. Tannic and tart with a middling tongue burn. Some sweet kettle corn notes emerge after the burn subsides and a reprise of the spices promised by the nose. Cinnamon red-hots a thin glaze of vanilla frosting.Finish Of medium length. A little bit of everything – some sweetness and vanilla some dry oak some dusty cinnamon. Fades without changing much and no bitterness.With Water Water doesn’t seem to change the aroma much but adds a welcome nuttiness to the palate and especially the finish. Water is advisable here and also helps to tame the high ABV.Overall The rye certainly packs a punch here with a full complement of spices but it fails to elevate the corn/sweet bourbon out of the $20 rut. At $33 that actually makes this overpriced in my view. The proof is right and it’s perfectly passable in cocktails but it won’t shift Eagle Rare 10 or even basic Buffalo Trace out of my cabinet lineup.It might just be the mash bill but I don’t detect any similarities between this and the David Nicholson 1843 which I actually prefer. I’d guess that they were distilled at different locations. In fact it’s worth noting that this bottle’s label indicates distillation and aging somewhere in Kentucky while the 1843 does not mention its state of origin. Considering the two labels were clearly designed at the same time that might speak volumes.
141,Deanston (12 year) - Deanston… what can I say about Deanston… I have this mental film-reel in my head of a Burn Stewart middle-manager tasting a 12 year-old cask sample in the Deanston warehouse after taking over ownership of the previously shuttered distillery. He frowns cocks his head and says “Well it’s garbage but we can probably sell it if we ride a trend. What are they clamoring for right now? Natural? Hand-made? Non-chill-filtered? That’ll work. Bottle it up boys! I have a meeting with Marketing.” I’m being harsh (and anachronistic Burn Stewart took over ownership in 1990) but I have trouble imagining a worse poster-child for the Craft Whisky Movement (TM) (c) (patent pending). It has everything on paper that whisky buffs have been asking for 46% “craft presentation” bottling strength non chill-filtration and no added coloring. It’s made more-or-less by hand and with traditional methods. It’s even located in a picturesque reclaimed mill building. On paper I should love it!I don’t.Actually I had one surprisingly tasty Deanston. It just didn’t have a Deanston label on it more’s the pity.So I thought maybe I’d climb up the age (and price) ladder and see if Deanston starts to shine after it leaves its NAS infancy. Luckily I found a glass 50ml miniature of the 12-year (aged in ex-bourbon casks) at a liquor shop. I’ve had good luck with glass miniatures not having off-flavors (unlike plastic ones). Does it redeem the Deanston name for me and let me buy the “Craft” hype?Nose Floral with notes of rosewater and orange blossom. Delicate aromas of peach white tea filtered honey fresh spring water and a slight nose tickle (alcohol).Palate Medium body. Initial tongue burn leaves primarily hay and toasted malt. Some woody character like bark but none of the delicate flowers or fruits promised by the aroma. Fairly earthy with some of those hay/bark notes verging on peat.Finish Short. A continuance of the palate with more bark and hay. As it fades it reveals faint banana and coconut.With Water Several drops of water seem to wash out the delicate aroma leaving a hint of fresh laundry and ozone. The palate becomes somewhat sweeter with a vanilla note. The finish becomes a bit brighter with a reprise of the peach notes. I’d avoid water with this because of what it does to the aroma.Overall Well I had high hopes but this is another Deanston dud for me. The nose promises so much with its airy insinuation of peach and honey and orange blossom flavors to come. Instead you get a mouthful of hay and some muddy puddles of peat water. I exaggerate but the flavor is definitely a let-down and it’s not redeemed by the vague finish. If I had to drain a bottle of this I could manage it but I wouldn’t fork over actual cash for a bottle even at $50 (didn’t you hear? $50 is the new $30 in whisky). Actually you might be better off pouring a Glencairn of this and giving it a solid whiff every few minutes. Just pour it down the drain when you’re done. You get the nice aroma and no hangover or calories! Think of it as whisky aromatherapy. You’re welcome.
142,Deanston Virgin Oak - This bottle caught my eye while browsing at a Total Wine & More in Phoenix AZ. Craft presentation (46%+ ABV and not chill-filtered) an interesting finish (in virgin oak presumably charred) and $30? Sign me up! I’d never heard of the Central Highland distillery Deanston but at this price I figured I couldn’t go wrong.I was… well wrong.It pains me to write this review (see Overall below) because I’m very much in favor of distilleries getting on the NCF bandwagon and bottling at reasonable proofs. I’d love to support Deanston in its efforts and in its price point but the whisky is just simply not good.Nose An unappetizing chemical component like partially-cured leather. Beeswax without the honey. Dry dusty stale malt. Wet cardboard.Palate Nicely creamy body. Minimal tongue burn. A hint of honey hardwood sawdust and something saline like salted ice cream.Finish Short. A lot of oaky bitterness and a return of the wet cardboard. Slight nougat and a tang of raw honey.With Water A small splash of water yielded a musty fungal odor and upped all the negative notes. It also thinned the body somewhat and added some hazelnut to the palate and finish and made the finish somewhat sweeter. Not pleasant either way.Overall Wow I really don’t like this. A shame because I’ve read that recent changes at Deanston had upped its single-malt game. The craft presentation (non-chill-filtering and 46%+ ABV) is a huge plus but it’s a pity that this NAS release fell horribly flat. I gave it the benefit of the doubt too and went through several glasses over several weeks before resigning myself to writing this review. It’s just not good even at this bargain-basement price. It tastes like the “virgin oak” used to finish the whisky was from a tainted or improperly cured barrel. A pity but I hold out hope that the age-statement releases are much better.
143,Dewar’s (12 year) Special Reserve Blended Scotch - Read my review of the bottom-shelf White Label from Dewar’s here. I wasn’t impressed. So I snagged a miniature of the 12-year aged version of Dewar’s house blend to see if a little age improves the dram. As with White Label the 12-year is a blend of many components with Aberfeldy single-malt at its heart. It says “Special Reserve” on the label which as we all know is not special and the only thing ‘reserved’ is a marked quantity of barrels set aside for longer aging. I could leave a few M&Ms from my bag out on the counter overnight and call them “special reserve” too.Note As discovered by the commenters below Dewar’s appears to have dropped its 12 year-old from 43% ABV (the one I tasted) to 40% ABV sometime in the last few years. It appears to have also dropped the “Special Reserve” on the label. This review is for the older possibly no longer available 43% ABV bottling with “Special Reserve” on the label.Nose Lemon curd on buttered scones. A bit of paint-thinner – a lot more nose tickle than I like to see in a 43% ABV. A clear quantity of grain whisky – light vanilla unripe fruit and fresh hay. Definitely on the “light and airy” side but with an unpleasant amount of burn.Palate Light cream – not very heavy-bodied despite all the grain. Potent and the 43% ABV comes through nicely with just the right amount of tongue burn. Hazelnut skins brown sugar cookies and lemon peel.Finish Short but not unpleasantly bitter. Some lingering pastry notes and a hint of bitter lemon. A suggestion of wood. Final note is just bitterness – oh well.With Water A splash of water releases a hint of anise and tames the nose tickle somewhat. It also improves the sweetness of the dram and rounds out some of the off flavors. It doesn’t do a whole lot for the finish and the bitterness remains. Nevertheless this is a whisky that benefits greatly from the addition of water.Overall On the upside it’s only slightly more expensive than the White Label so if you’re getting an inexpensive blend anyway it’s worth the upgrade. It has all the hallmarks of the “mid-range” blend light in style heavily “watered-down” with cheap grain whisky and that telltale bitter finish. Sure the malt component is 12 years old and I’m sure it’s lovely but it’s marred by 12 year-old grain whisky which needs another 6 or so to mellow out. Yes it’s better than White Label but it doesn’t stand up to even the cheapest single malts. I’d take Glenlivet 12 over this any day. Another blend bites the dust.Note Remember that I’m reviewing these whiskies on the basis of drinking straight at room-temperature. I’m sure Dewar’s 12 goes nicely in a Rob Roy but that’s just not what this blog is about.
144,Dewar’s White Label Blended Scotch - The number-one selling scotch in the United States. Really this is a surprise to me. I would have thought the honor would belong to Johnnie Walker Red Label or Chivas Regal. 311 million Americans can’t be wrong right? Let’s find out.Dewar’s blended scotch has a storied history going back to 1846 when John Dewar became one of the first men to bottle scotch (blended) in glass bottles for retail. In 1899 John Dewar’s son John A. Dewar unveiled the company’s new flagship product Dewar’s White Label. The main component was the malt produced at the newly-constructed Aberfeldy distillery in the Highlands near Perthshire. Dewar’s built the distillery to ensure a steady supply of malt for blending. Today’s White Label still retains Aberfeldy malt as its ‘heart’ or primary malt component and also contains as many as 40 other malts and grain whiskies.Nose Lemony. White peach. Chloraseptic. Thin. After a rest in the glass white peaches dominate. Lemon sorbet and a distinct neutral spirit – something in between vodka and cleaning solution. Pale honey and a hint of hops. Luckily the white fruit and citrus counterpoint the harshness of the alcohol in the nose but it’s still clear this contains young grain spirit.Palate A bit of creaminess in the body – unexpected. The alcohol hits harshly upfront then quickly dissipates leaving watered-down honey small beer and lemon peel.Finish Very short and uninteresting. The lemon floats to the top but the vodka notes win out in the end leaving an impression of low-quality spirit.With Water If anything the nose is sharper with less nuance. The palate seems unchanged although there might be a bit of vanilla that wasn’t present before.Overall This is probably very nice over ice although in cocktails I would think the light flavor would be completely overpowered by any mixer. I’m no mixologist however. The lemon notes throughout are nice as is the white peach on the nose. The slight creaminess of the body is an unexpected plus. Unfortunately the ungainly presence of the low-grade grain spirit tramples over the delicate flavors leaving you with an impression of minimum quality. You get as the saying goes what you pay for. This is somewhat drinkable straight (although I wouldn’t want a second glass after all that vodka-like aftertaste) but I wouldn’t consider it the best choice at this level. Try Famous Grouse Teacher’s Highland Cream or Chivas Regal 12 first. Of course for a bit more money Great King Street is better in every way and has a very similar flavor profile.I think America needs to expand its horizons somewhat although I guess all a brand has to do to establish itself as the “Number One Scotch in the US” is to become the standard ‘well’ whisky at the majority of bars. I guess the slogan “Number One Scotch For Americans Who Don’t Care What’s In Their Cocktails” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.
145,District Made Bourbon - In a sea of local small-batch “craft” distilleries it’s hard to even remember which ones you’ve tried let alone which ones are good. It seems every trip to the liquor store I’m met with several new and unfamiliar labels. One Eight Distilling has been making bourbon and rye (and vodka and gin) in the US Capitol since 2015. Their flagship product District Made – formerly known as Rock Creek – is purportedly the first whiskey distilled aged and bottled in Washington D.C. since Prohibition.The District Made Straight Bourbon is an unusual “four-grain” (corn wheat rye (malted and unmalted) and malted barley) bourbon made from regional ingredients Corn and wheat from Lands End Farm in Chesterown Maryland rye from Fairview Cattle & Grain in Culpeper Virgina and malted barley and rye from Riverbend Malt House in Asheville North Carolina. The bourbon is aged for 2 years in new charred oak and bottled at a robust 47.5% ABV.I found my bottle while in D.C. for a family event so I’m not sure how wide their distribution is yet. I’d like to say I was hunting for local gems but in fact I just wanted something to make whiskey sours with.Nose Pleasant corn. Moderately sweet with cherry notes. Both nutty and oaky (just enough). Excellent balance. Bit of a nose tickle.Palate Syrupy body. Sweet again with moderate to heavy tongue burn. Nutty and oaky again. Turns a bit dry which provides a nice contrast with the prior sweetness.Finish Medium long. Bitter charcoal up front the finish is much drier. Some dark cocoa and espresso.With Water Water turns down the sweetness a notch and adds cocoa to the aroma. Less tongue burn but no additional notes on the palate. Water optional.Overall Excellent for a 2 year-old bourbon from a new distillery. Great balance especially on the aroma. Sufficient complexity on the palate to elevate it above “entry level” craft bourbon. A surprise.$50 is a bit high for the experience surprise or no. I would be happier paying $40 and hope that as the company matures and scales up its products might come down in price to a more competitive level.
146,Eagle Rare (10 year) Bourbon - The Great Hunt For My House Bourbon continues! I recently picked up a bottle of Eagle Rare 10 year which lately has become better known as the younger and more-available version of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection’s Eagle Rare 17 which is almost as difficult to acquire as Pappy Van Winkle bourbon. Funny how in this era of whisky obsession that the standard is eclipsed by the limited. Having been guilty of dismissing the 10 year as “not worth my time” in the past I certainly can’t point fingers. I want several things in a house bourbon. I want it to be under $30 (preferably under $25). I want it to be regularly and widely available. I want it to be high enough quality to enjoy neat but also play nice with ice bitters and sugar to make a top-notch cocktail. As I am still trying to find the perfect house bourbon for under $30 I figured I’d give this one a try especially since it’s made by the same distillery as my current front-runner Buffalo Trace.The Eagle Rare brand originally a 101-proof Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey aged at least 10 years began in 1975 under the ownership of the Seagram Company. It was sold to the Sazerac Company (later named Buffalo Trace) in 1989 which finally discontinued the 101-proof version in 2005. In its place a 90 proof (45% ABV) 10 year-old single-barrel and a 90 proof 17 year-old became the standard Eagle Rare releases. The 17 year-old is part of the limited annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) and is generally difficult to find. Recently during a label redesign Eagle Rare’s “Single Barrel” designation was dropped and the age statement moved to the back of the label. According to this interesting account by Clay Risen in 2014 this is due to a change in the bottling procedure for Eagle Rare which is still bottled one barrel at a time but can no longer be guaranteed to contain liquid only from one barrel.Eagle Rare uses Buffalo Trace’s “Low Rye” mash bill which is shared with the Buffalo Trace bottling Stagg Jr. George T. Stagg and others. This also means that Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare 10 differ only in barrel selection and age. One might think of ER 10 as a longer-aged version of Buffalo Trace with more picky barrel selection. Not a bad trade-off for only $5 – $8 more per bottle…Nose Sweet and a little tart – orange peel and unripe cherries. Soft sweet corn and a layer of caramel. Little or no spice.Palate Silky smooth body with the tart cherries up front a bit of a burn and then creamed corn malted cereal orange marmalade and a hint of oak.Finish Medium length with just a ghost of the palate flavors. A little caramel a little orange peel then gone.With Water Water seems to neither improve nor harm the whisky.Overall A very nicely balanced nose with both tart and sweet notes in harmony. I could wish for some hint of rye spice and a more robust finish. Still I already prefer this to the similar and similarly-priced Elijah Craig 12. While the EJ12 has an edge in ABV and a more robust nose Eagle Rare is miles ahead on the palate and is much more balanced. Eagle Rare 10 is also a very different animal than Buffalo Trace despite being made at the same distillery from the same mash bill. ER10 has none of the Buffalo Trace sugar cane / vegetal complexity and an entirely different fruit profile. While I would definitely drink this neat with those orange and cherry notes it’s practically begging to be made into an Old Fashioned (no actual cherry and orange please keep it subtle).Well it’s official. The only attribute that Eagle Rare 10 lacks on my “house bourbon” wishlist is consistency – as a Single Barrel release (or nearly so) it might vary from bottle to bottle. Still I’ll take the individuality and chance of greatness over consistency any day. I now have a new house bourbon! If you haven’t given Eagle Rare 10 a chance because of Internet consensus that its big brother is the underdog of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection you really should take another look.
147,Edradour (10 year) - For some reason when I picture tiny little Edradour in equally tiny Pitlochry I think of light floral small-batch whisky. I don’t know where I got this impression because it’s dead wrong. Now that I’ve tasted both this 10-year distillery official bottling and the special-release 12-year Caledonia I can’t find any more apt phrase to describe Edradour than “sherry bomb” and it’s by no means tiny in flavor. I must admit that I was downright shocked by the dense fungal old flavor of the sherry character in Edradour even at the relatively young age of 10 years. There is more rancio and dried fruit in this 10 year-old than I’ve ever found in Macallan 18. Although this isn’t as refined or silky-smooth as Macallan it’s a big sherry monster with a lot going on and well worth a look.This particular bottling is 40% ABV and is chill-filtered and from the U.K. Apparently the distillery also releases a 10 year-old at 43% perhaps for the US market? Please let me know in the comments if that’s incorrect.Nose Sherry for sure. Rancio notes like funky dried fruit. A fungal woodiness pervades – like decaying trees and wet fallen leaves. This smells surprisingly old for a young 10. Beneath a bit of caramel apple.Palate Nice mouth-coating sweet fruity candy raisins caramel apple and a little more of that borderline-rancid oxidized wine flavor.Finish Relatively long. A hint of smoke dried cherries and a nice lingering woodiness that never grows bitter.With Water Water seems to dampen the nose. On the palate it wakes some fresher fruit but at the expense of an increased alcohol burn. I would avoid the water especially with the low bottling proof.Overall I was surprised at both the apparent age and the quality of this sample. It is in no way inferior to the Caledonia sample I had last year and is robust and flavorful despite being only 40% ABV. For a 10 year-old to have this much deep oxidized sherry flavor is impressive and a testament to whatever casks they’re using. In a blind tasting I would have said this was 17 years old and I may have to start hunting around for a full bottle.
148,Edradour Caledonia 12 - “But if I should become a stranger know that it would make me more than sad. Caledonia’s been everything I’ve ever had…”Dougie MacLean’s lilting ballad about his homeland of Scotland (Caledonia is the latin-icized name for Scotland given by the Romans) released in 1979 is the inspiration for this special release from tiny Highland distillery Edradour. Dougie actually had a hand in choosing the casks for the whisky and helps promote it. I’ve loved the song since I heard it years ago and had to give the single-malt a try. Luckily I came across a 50ml miniature in Berkeley CA and snapped it up.Caledonia is bottled at 46% ABV and is not chill-filtered nor are any coloring agents added. The current release is 12 years old and aged in oloroso sherry. As this was a special release from a distillery with minuscule production quantities I’m not sure how easy it would be to track down a bottle.Nose Light but evident sherry. Red plums caramel-coated Red Delicious apples. Nose reminds me a little of the heft of GlenDronach. Meaty and thick aroma like dense fig cake. Underneath it has the nose of a delicate Speysider all honey and florals. A dash of water wakes up some orange peel notes.Palate Heavy bodied and mouth-coating. High tongue burn but that resolves into a nice mix of sherry characteristics (more red plums spice cake port wine reduction) and malty cereal flavors – mostly of the caramelized sugar variety. The water thins the body slightly perhaps also tames the burn somewhat and gives the fruit flavors a crisp acidic edge.Finish Medium-long length with swirling eddies of grape jam balsamic vinegar strawberry preserves and a last bit of orange marmalade and honey.Overall A very weighty dram with big fruit-bomb sherry a thick mouthfeel and a barrage of cooked fruit flavors. It feels like a 50%-plus ABV whisky on the tongue and even has some of the elements of good cask-strength sherry bombs. There’s a lot packed into this little 46% ABV package. Kudos on the craft presentation as well – here’s a great example of why neither chill filtration nor caramel coloring is necessary when you start with good malt whisky. Try it without the water first since it seems to diminish some of the jammy notes and replaces them with acidic fresh fruit.
149,Elijah Craig (12 year) Bourbon - Update Heaven Hill has discontinued the Elijah Craig 12 year (announcement was in early 2016) and replaced it with a no-age-statement Elijah Craig Small Batch.Elijah Craig 12 is a small-batch bourbon made by prolific distiller Heaven Hill in Bardstown Kentucky and is named after Reverend Elijah Craig who is apocryphally credited with the invention of oak aging of corn whisky to create bourbon. Heaven Hill is also responsible for among others brands Evan Williams Henry McKenna Larceny Old Fitzgerald Rittenhouse Rye Bernheim Original 7 year (pause for breath) Parker’s Heritage Rebel Yell and so on. Several of those bourbons including Evan Williams and Henry McKenna share the same mash bill with Elijah Craig 75% corn 13% rye and 12% barley (the barley is there to provide enzymes to “kick-start” the fermentation). One might call this a “low-rye” bourbon.Heaven Hill also produces hard-to-find variants A cask-strength version of Elijah Craig 12 year (it still has the age statement!) and 18- 20- 21- and 23-year bottlings.Nose Sumptuous caramel cinnamon-sugar apples heavy oak maraschino cherries (the bright red kind) serious brown sugar and molasses.Palate Thin body only slightly hot considering the high ABV. Big tannin-y oak up front and not particularly sweet.Finish On the short side. Hazelnuts. Furniture lacquer. Cinnamon and a hint of star anise.With Water A few drops of water bring vanilla and more sweetness to the nose. The palate becomes a bit more balanced and the water causes some of the brown-sugar notes to carry on through to the finish. When drinking this neat the water may be a good idea.Overall Elijah Craig starts off promising on the nose with lots of sugar oak and great depth. However it fails to deliver on that promise when it hits the palate where it’s thin and oaky and simple. The higher-than-normal ABV gives it an edge in cocktails where its flavors can come across but I wouldn’t choose this for my house bourbon. That said if a bottle landed in my lap I would make good use of it in a whole mess of Old Fashioneds.Elijah Craig 12 is effectively the same price as the current leader in my “house bourbon” hunt Eagle Rare 10 while the Craig has 2 years and 2% ABV on Eagle Rare it doesn’t keep up in terms of flavor. That said put two Old Fashioneds in front of me made from each bourbon and I very much doubt I could tell the difference.
150,Elijah Craig (12 year) Small Batch Barrel Proof Bourbon - Elijah Craig bourbon from Heaven Hill distillery has been feeling the same press of demand affecting the entire bourbon industry. In response several years ago they converted their flagship 12 year-old Small Batch bottling to a NAS edition blending in whisky 4 years younger. Luckily the cask-strength (Barrel Proof) bottling retains its 12 year age statement despite a recent label revamp. Savvy observers will note that the number is not on the front of the label but rather tucked away on the side of the bottle. With other producers this has historically been a precursor to dropping the age statement altogether. We shall see.Elijah Craig is Kentucky straight bourbon. The Barrel Proof bottlings made in three “small” batches per year are aged for 12 years in new charred oak barrels and bottled uncut (without any water added) and without chill filtration. They are from the same low-rye mash bill as the cheaper 46% ABV (now NAS) small batch edition 75% corn 13% rye and 12% malted barley (for enzymes).Regarding the batch numbering system from the company’s websiteThe first letter of the batch number indicates which of that year’s releases the bottle was a part of starting with “A” while the second digit is a number that determines the month of the year the bottle was released. The third and fourth digits indicate the year.My bottle is from batch C917 meaning it was released in September 2017 (the third batch of that year). It is a mouth-searing 65.5% ABV which felt like a lot until I discovered that some previous batches had been as high as 70% ABV. Ouch.Nose Fresh-hewn lumber. Dry and sappy. Seriously this smells like the inside of a lumber mill. While there is an oak weight to the wood aromas there is also a piney aspect. Despite the high proof the nose tickle is manageable. A noticeable lack of sweet notes.Palate Thick bodied. Liquid wood. Dense and astringent. The tongue burn is searing but brief. Dry (still no sugar) but concentrated and heady. My wounded tongue feels like it’s hallucinating cinnamon and clove.Finish Long. Now a little sweetness creeps in in the form of caramelized wood sugar. Not bitter or charcoal-heavy at all. Pungent cheek-drying oak tannins. A fading hint of powdery cinnamon.With Water A dash of water mutes the aroma but adds some caramel both to the nose and palate. A little cherry creeps in and the overall impression is far more balanced. Don’t expect a little water to save your tongue though this stuff is still 131 proof. Water highly recommended here.Overall This is 12 year-old dry bourbon at its most elemental. Expect little sweetness and a metric ton of wood but you won’t be able to fault this for pungent bourbon flavor. I highly recommend dosing it with a little water tasting and then dosing it with quite a lot more. Reminds me of Buffalo Trace at high proof but with less grass and more wood. This is one of the most-afforable ways to buy quality cask-strength bourbon but is not my favorite (that would be Stagg Jr. at the moment).
151,Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon - Today I’m here to talk about another fallen soldier in the whisky war of attrition known as “supply vs demand”. Heaven Hill in a statement issued in early 2016 announced that it would be replacing Elijah Craig 12 year-old with a non-age-statement version (“Small Batch”) which contains whiskey aged 8 to 12 years of age due to “increasing pressure” to “stocks of 12-year-old barrels”. As the cynics in the comment section will point out no doubt without an age statement it could literally all be 4 years old since the word of a PR person assuring a “blend of barrels between 8 and 12 years of age” carries no legal weight. I prefer to take them at their word (at least they didn’t make this switch in attempted secrecy) and will assume the bourbon is mostly 8 years old with a smattering of older barrels up to 12. Note that the Barrel Proof edition still has a 12-year age statement.Honestly I’m not too torn up about it as I wasn’t a huge fan of the 12 year. I rated the Elijah Craig 12 year-old a solid “Try Before Buy” and when I saw that the new NAS Small Batch is actually priced a little lower than its predecessor ($25 ish vs. $30 ish) I thought I’d give the new one a try. If nothing else a $25 NAS bourbon is useful for cocktails right?Nose A little shy. The first impression is of an indeterminate nuttiness. Some sweet vanilla banana cream and a hint of coconut underscore the reticent oak. Round and soft but without much presence. As usual a rest in the glass reveals more vanilla and more refined sugar (as in vanilla cake frosting).Palate Thin body. Very soft with a mild tongue burn. Again there isn’t much to describe beyond nondescript nut butter tannic oak and cake frosting. A bitter note suggests but does not assert spices such as clove and cinnamon.Finish More sweetness here with black licorice nonpareils drying tannins and very little to no bitterness. Fades inoffensively self-effacing.With Water A few drops of water yield a vegetal (grassy) note and increases the nose tickle. The palate is slightly more alert but does not add anything substantial. Water optional.Overall The word “shy” describes just about every facet of the experience of drinking this whiskey. It nearly glides along the palate without interacting much with the taste buds (hence the “soft” descriptor) and while it has a nice round balanced interplay of tropical fruit wood and alcohol the whole is dialed down to “low”. Oddly it doesn’t taste particularly watery or watered-down but rather that the alcohol carries little with it in the way of flavor compounds. This might be a good whiskey to balance subtle ingredients in a contemplative cocktail where you don’t want the bourbon to overwhelm something else. At $25 that’s not bad but it feels like this is crafted for an audience that doesn’t really want to taste their bourbon. A more likely explanation is this is what happens when you take a “value” bourbon and compromise on the barrel ages of the components. Drop 4 years and you lose a lot of oaky sugars in the aroma roundness on the palate and spices in the finish. That tell-tale grassy note that showed when water was added is also a consequence of the younger juice. At the lower price-point this is still a “Try Before Buy” but I’ve tried it and I won’t be buying more.
152,Ellington Reserve (8 year) Canadian Whisky - Lately I’ve been thinking about Canadian whisky. Other than Crown Royal there isn’t really a lot of Canadian whisky available to US drinkers and most of what’s available is… uhm… not very highly-regarded. That’s all changing with imports of products from Forty Creek Lot 40 and others. But to put that into perspective I felt a need to sample some of the existing “blended” Canadian whisky products already available here.I should know by now that a plastic 50ml sample bottle is a bad sign. A $15 price tag on a 750ml bottle? Equally bad sign. But hey the bottle says the whisky is 8 years old! An age statement on a cheap blended whisky? Maybe things are looking up! I can’t find a website or ANY information about the whisky other than its age. Like most blended Canadian whisky sold in the US it’s almost certainly bulk aged spirit imported by tanker truck into the US and then proofed down and bottled.Nose A blast of young grain a wave of artificial vanilla and something vegetal like fresh-cut cabbage. There is also a cloying sweetness attached to the vanilla.Palate Eughh. Chemical solvent and a very fake taste like concentrated food dye. The melted-ice-cream vanilla flavor tastes like it was added in by the bag. I don’t want to swallow it but onward in the name of Science!Finish Extremely (mercifully?) short although it leaves behind a coating in your mouth like someone’s been spraying RoundUp weed killer nearby and you got some in your mouth. Truly wretched.With Water Didn’t even try.Overall Please please don’t buy this. If one person somewhere reads this review in a BevMo and puts the bottle back on the shelf then I have done my duty as a whisky blogger and I can die contented. Buy anything – literally anything – instead. You’re better off with vodka “aged” overnight in a coffee cup.OK yes it’s possible this sample was contaminated by being in a plastic miniature bottle (I’ve certainly had bad luck before with miniatures especially plastic ones). However you’d have a hard time convincing me that this stuff could be improved by ANY amount of careful storage. Also any company that cares so little about repeat business that it allows miniatures (which many people use to “try before buying”) with this amount of degradation to represent their product deserves the bad press.
153,Evan Williams Black Label Bourbon - Today it’s a tale of two whiskeys Heaven Hill Distillery’s bottom-shelfer Evan Williams Black Label Bourbon (you can find it for $10 a bottle) versus the much more acclaimed Evan Williams Single Barrel (2000 vintage). The question Does barrel selection and an extra three years of age make $15-$20 worth of difference?First we take a look at the cheapo. At $10 a bottle sale-price it’s hard to beat the Evan Williams Black Label bottling for value. Aged around 6 years (likely a vatting of product aged minimum 4 years and up to 7 years) and bottled at the slightly-higher 43% ABV you simply can’t get a better American whiskey if your budget is $10. That’s not quite enough to recommend it however so let’s do a tastingNose Candle wax cantaloupe burned marshmallow butane lighter fluid.Palate Sweet white chocolate and maple sugar candy on the entry resolving into a typical bourbon profile of corn syrup wood char and neutral spirit. A little too sweet and cloying. The alcohol burn is brash and vodka-like.Finish Vanilla creme brûlée blackstrap rum and candy corn. Medium-length but marred by that “impure spirit” aftertaste.Overall Not impressed. It has more flavors going for it than your average bottom-shelf whiskey but its brash young grain and overbearing corn sweetness are just too much to recommend it anywhere but the cocktail glass. Normally as this is not something I would ever drink neat again I would give it a “Not Recommended”. However the effort displayed by the extra aging and ABV and the phenomenally low price tick it up to the “Mediocre” level. Sorry Evan Williams fans. However! Scroll up to see my opinion of the Evan Williams Single Barrel (2000 vintage).
154,Evan Williams Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon - Evan Williams is one of those bourbons that you could easily miss on the shelf due to its ho-hum label or your eye could pass over it and assume it’s something else. With a $10-a-bottle Black Label and a much-acclaimed and then quickly-forgotten Single Barrel Evan Williams has not exactly been screaming into the public consciousness. Still much like many Beam products there’s something to be said for cheap reliable Heaven Hill distillate. I snagged a full liter bottle of the Bottled-in-Bond version (basically a four year-old Black Label with a little extra proof on it) for $19 at Costco recently. Now I wish I’d bought four more to keep me in Old Fashioneds through the Great Quarantine of 2020.Heaven Hill is a storied Kentucky whiskey company that has been churning out reliable booze since 1935. Operations shifted to the current location at the Heaven Hill Bernheim distillery (DSP KY 1) in 1999 after a fire destroyed its main production facility in 1996. Aside from the eponymous Heaven Hill bourbon the company also makes several old standbys including Elijah Craig Old Fitzgerald and Rittenhouse rye. They also make some newer names like Henry McKenna (not actually new just more widely distributed now) and Larceny.Like Elijah Craig and Henry McKenna Evan Williams has a mash bill of 75% Corn 13% Rye and 12% Barley. It’s also Kentucky straight bourbon but because it’s labeled “bottled in bond” it’s aged for at least 4 years and bottled at 50% ABV (100 proof). It can be found in bottle sizes of 750ml 1 liter and 1.75 liter all for very reasonable prices.Nose Sweet and soft with initial notes of sweet corn cherry syrup and marshmallow. Mild nutty oak. Simple straightforward and pleasant. A rest in the glass adds a tutti-frutti or fruit punch note.Palate Thin body. Cherry throat lozenge and caramel frosting greet the tongue followed by a moderate tongue burn that also introduces cinnamon clove and brown sugar. Once again simple but effective with no off-notes.Finish Medium-long. Warming. Palate flavors continue plus mild mouth-drying tannins (like nut skins) vanilla cake frosting and the mildest of oak notes. Fades without evolving but also without turning bitter. As with the aroma a rest in the glass adds a fruit punch note.With Water Several drops of water initially mute the aroma which struggles to wake back up even after a rest. The palate and finish seem oddly muddled and the tongue burn is actually a little more piercing. Skip the water here if you’re drinking it neat.Overall Quintessential bourbon with a potent flavor that is appropriate for 100 proof whiskey but with a surprisingly mild tongue burn despite that proof. The flavors are all exactly what you expect from a rye-flavored bourbon but you also don’t get any off-flavors or evidence of immature whiskey. For the price this may be one of the best bourbons under $20 and is a slam dunk choice for home bourbon-based cocktails.
155,Evan Williams Single Barrel Bourbon (Vintage 2000) - Today it’s a tale of two whiskeys Heaven Hill Distillery’s bottom-shelfer Evan Williams Black Label Bourbon (you can find it for $10 a bottle) versus the much more acclaimed Evan Williams Single Barrel (2000 vintage). Both are Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. The question Does barrel selection and an extra three years of age make $15-$20 worth of difference?We’ve already smacked the Black Label with a “Mediocre”. Now let’s see how the Single-Barrel fares. It’s aged for closer to nine years bottled from hand-selected barrels and vintage-dated and hand-labelled. Who pioneered the practice of bottling special-edition whisk(e)y from single barrels to showcase the diversity and uniqueness of each cask of matured spirit the Scots or the Americans? I have no idea. Probably the Scots. But either way I think it’s a fantastic way to offer whisk(e)y fans an ever-changing taste of the nuances of barrel aging. My bottle is from Barrel #1033 and according to the label is exactly 9 years 11 months and 17 days old. I love knowing these kinds of details! On to the tasting.Nose Somewhat muted nose without even much tickle. Candle wax (seems to be an Evan Williams signature?) pumpkin-spice sweet corn. A dash of water wakes it up a little yielding some caramel and hard candies.Palate Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Loads of coconut up front with some yeasty sourdough bread campfire ashes toasted marshmallow and hazelnut. The water also brings out the sweeter notes without compromising body.Finish Medium-length and tame – coconut and vanilla very slight oakiness with a fading hint of charred wood and roasted nuts.Overall an extremely smooth unchallenging dram. After a week drinking fiery young bourbons I find that this one is miles ahead in sophistication. Although it doesn’t yield many exciting flavors or anything unexpected it is eminently drinkable and very satisfying. While I would definitely drink this again (a good thing since I have a whole bottle) it still doesn’t wind me up like an excellent Scotch. Still at $25 it’s a much better value. Try it with a few drops of water.To answer my original question is the extra cost of the Evan Williams Single-Barrel justified? Yes! In fact I would recommend skipping the Black Label entirely and always going with the Single-Barrel.
156,Exclusive Malts: Bowmore (12 year) 2001-2014 - Sorry sorry. Another independent bottling that you’ll never see on a shelf and are unlikely to want to drop more than $80 on if you did see it. Why? Because I’m digging into my tasting note archives to rush this out the door while working on a revamp of my site’s theme to make it mobile-friendly. That’s my excuse and I’m sticking to it.I’ve become more and more interested in Bowmore. While the distillery standard 12 year ended up with a “Just OK” rating from me I’m constantly tasting Bowmore special editions like Devil’s Cask NAS offerings like Small Batch and the affordable Legend and independents like this one and being very impressed. After a few bottles of Ardbeg and the other peat-forward drams I’ve found that I like my peat to be in harmony with the malt and not shouting over it. I also appreciate the rounder softer peat in Bowmore rather than the edgier harsher smokier peat in Laphroaig or Talisker. I have to be in “the mood” for Talisker or Laphroaig. Not so for Bowmore.This particular 12 year-old independent bottling from Exclusive Malts imported by ImpEx was aged in a refill sherry cask and bottled without coloring or chill-filtration. Thanks to Katia at ImpEx for providing the sample.Nose Leather orange furniture polish and a muddy marshy peat meet the nose first. Clearly this is sherried but the sherry effect is that of a much older cask – concentrated meaty resiny and with a fat helping of rancio (past balsamic and verging on rotting fruit). The peat is actually out-performed by the rancidity of the sherry. I’m not certain I would be able to tell this was peated in a blind tasting.Palate Big and fiery at first then fruit-forward with figs raisins and prunes. A milder level of rancid notes thankfully serving instead to underscore the “old” flavor of the sherry and making the whole dram seem older. The peat still does not assert itself.Finish Much more leather supple and accentuated by fading fruit notes. Peat peeks in at the end but is still overshadowed by the remnants of rancio. Not bitter.With Water A few drops of water lessen the intensity of the nose but don’t yield any new notes. The tongue burn is tamed and a bit more orange oil appears on the tongue. Try both with and without water. Diluting it to 46% makes it eminently more drinkable but the intensity of the sherry is lost and the overall effect is forgettable.Overall Who knew this was going to be a sherry-bomb? Sherry notes that I’d associate with a 20+ year-old sherried malt meaty and resinous. The peat is nowhere to be found or so outperformed by the sherry that it instead melds into the background. I would recommend this to sherry buffs especially those who enjoy the meaty/rancio side of the sherry spectrum. Alas the price on this is a little optimistic. I’d happily pay $50 for a 12 year-old Bowmore with these characteristics but not $80 and especially not more than $100. Still if you’ve got money to burn and enjoy both rancio sherry and Bowmore you’ll enjoy this one for sure. For everyone else this is a “Try before you buy”.
157,Exclusive Malts: Laphroaig (8 year) 2005-2013 - (Note This review directly contrasts this bottling with the official bottling of Laphroaig 10-year Cask Strength at 57.8%)I received a sample of the Exclusive Malts single-cask bottling of Laphroaig distilled 2005/bottled 2013 by the distributor ImpEx Beverages (Thanks Katia!). It’s a single-cask Laphroaig bottled at 55.9% ABV. As usual with single-casks from independents I’m looking for two very specific things. I want it first to taste better than the similarly-aged cask-strength official bottling from the distillery (OR be significantly cheaper). Second I want to detect something unique in it – a component from the official bottling that is amplified or elevated in the single-cask or a unique note that gets hidden by the vatting of other casks in the official bottling. If it does not have both of those things then I can’t see a reason to spend money on it.Also I’m always clear with anyone who sends me review samples that I will not give a more positive review of something just because it’s free. I am however always grateful for samples – I love getting to taste a new whisky especially when I can directly contrast it with a similar product from the same distillery. I also have a sample of Laphroaig’s official cask strength 10 year-old here which I’ll refer to as “the OB”. With that said let’s dive in…Nose Slightly more vanilla than the OB. Also a bit more cereal sweetness. Not quite as much meatiness. Otherwise notes are the same – intense Laphroaig peat and seaweed.Palate Far sweeter on the tongue than the OB. Vanilla in spades and the usual complement of peat and salt notes although not as complete as the OB is. This seems to be missing all of the charred meat notes.Finish Long of course. Same notes (echoes of the peat and smoke aromas) but with a suggestion of sandalwood.With Water Water here does only what you’d expect it to – tames the burn amps up the vanilla and makes the finish sweeter. With this one I would use water only to dilute the dram to a drinkable strength.Overall I struggle to find something unique here. It tastes like the OB cask strength but with a few drops of vanilla extract added and with the complex smoky meaty flavor reduced. It could be thought of as a component of Laphroaig and thus available as an analysis of one aspect of the OB but its only claim to individuality – the increased vanilla – is little reason for me to own a bottle. Between the cheaper OB cask strength and this I’ll opt for the OB.
158,Exclusive Malts: Linkwood (14 year) 1999-2014 - Linkwood. Linkwood… Nope I got nothin’.I’ve heard of Linkwood in the same way you hear of Happy the dwarf Blitzen the reindeer and Pete Best the Beatle (see what I did there?) in a list of other barely-knowns. The distillery a long-time stalwart in the blending library of Diageo hadn’t had a branded official single-malt bottling until 2008 aside from occasional inclusion in Diageo’s Flora and Fauna series of one-offs. Most of the liquid produced goes into blends such as Johnnie Walker and White Horse which is an old story with Diageo’s various “blending fodder” distilleries such as Glen Ord Clynelish Glen Elgin Royal Lochnagar and so on.Thanks to Katia from ImpEx I was able to try my first Linkwood a 14 year-old single barrel from Exclusive Malts. One interesting aspect of the whisky which I’ve tasted in some other single malts was this “barnyard” flavor that often crops up in whisky books. It’s hard to describe beyond that moniker – something in between mouldy barn rafters dusty well-settled hay and unwashed animal hides. While that sounds awful it brings an undefinable aura of authenticity to a malt a reminder that this is a real product of the earth made by real people with sweat on their brows and from barley farmed by people with horses in their barns. (Although the flavor may be from 4-ethyl phenol which builds up in old wine barrels). With quality control and careful consistency management this is a flavor that is disappearing from the whisky landscape as it doesn’t align with the crisp packaging and snappy logos of the modern era. More’s the pity.Nose Hay. A ghost of peat. Barnyard with the heady mustiness that comes with older-style malt. Light and wispy.Palate Lemon-lime and a burst of sour sweetness followed by a very intense 110-proof tongue burn. After the tears clear from my eyes I can taste smoldering hay heathery peat (no sense of the ocean) and straightforward malt (breakfast cereal bakery goods etc.). Take small sips of this.Finish Long. The smoke comes to the fore with tons of charcoal briquette campfire and the ever-present hay. Fades without bitterness – nice!With Water A few drops of water bring a meaty/salty bacon-like element to the nose and tames the fire on the tongue. I highly recommend water with this dram.Overall I did not expect this level of peat from Linkwood. While it teases on the nose it makes itself felt once it hits the tongue. A nice example of the hay-and-heather style of Highland peated malt which is representative of the style of Highland malt made before the advent of maltings with non-peat heat sources.Try Before Buy unless you’re a big fan of Highland peated malt.
159,Exclusive Malts: Longmorn (20 year) 1992 – 2012 - Ok so I’m super late to the party again. I have a bad habit of buying really good bottles and then sitting on them until it’s too late to do any good to my readers. So in the interest of saving myself some face this post is a birthday present to myself. Why? Well it’s my birthday it’s a post about something that none of you can buy and (drumroll) this particular cask was distilled ON MY BIRTHDAY when I was 10 years old! I don’t even remember being 10 so the thought of this juice splashing out of the still and into a (probably) refill sherry cask to sleep for the next 20 years gives some real perspective to the glass in front of me. Also it makes me feel old.Distilled at Longmorn on the 22nd of June 1992 cask 86620 was bottled at 52.8% ABV 20 years later in 2012 exclusively for K&L Wine Merchants by independent brand The Exclusive Malts. K&L Exclusives get a lot of buzz in the whisky scene online but don’t have much impact to the rest of the world that doesn’t happen to live in California. That’s why I try to avoid writing about them even when I buy one. However I have the utmost respect for David Driscoll’s ability to select and negotiate excellent casks of whisky even if they usually come out above my ideal price point. This one I got to sample last year and I was blown away. I bought a bottle even though $120 is significantly higher than I usually spend. My excuse? Birthday!Nose Sticky sherry notes of strawberry jam apple cider vinegar fig preserves underlayed with oaky sap (not quite maple syrup). Powerful and delectable. The fruit is profound but not cloying. The oak is beautifully balanced and while the whole smells integrated and mature there aren’t excess rancid notes. Very fresh for 20 years old!Palate A powerhouse of fruit with equal helpings of jammed dried and fresh. The oak is present but not overwhelming and the tongue burn is surprisingly minimal for something over 50% ABV. It doesn’t fully represent its age without much balsamic-type flavors but it is round and complete. Eyes closed I would say it was 16 years old.Finish Jolly rancher candies a touch of cinnamon a lot of fruitcake and some more of that maple syrup (but not quite) on the fade-out. Becomes slightly bitter with nut skins and burned caramel on the tail.With Water A dash of water really opens up the fresh fruit – there are even some cherry blossom or apple blossom notes added. On the tongue the burn is even more muted and some chocolate notes are displayed. The malt alone is an experience water brings it to another level.Overall Wow. What a birthday present to me! I have a weak spot for fruit-bomb sherried numbers and this ticks all of the boxes (except one). The nose is phenomenal especially with some water to open it up and on the tongue it purrs with sherry goodness and no undue burn. Alas the finish has more bitterness than I like. Nevertheless this is a fantastic whisky and a real solid reason to seek out some more Longmorn especially if it’s sherried.Note K&L sold out of this a long time ago but they still have this which sounds similar http//www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1155020.
160,Exclusive Malts: North Highland (17 year) 1996-2014 - Now that I’m an established *cough* “Whisky Reviewer” aka Imposter-Journalist-with-a-Whisky-Blog I get a decent number of samples mailed to me by distributors and importers. Some of them I ask for (Ok Ok BEG for) and some just arrive. The good people at ImpEx (Thanks Katia!) seem to like me and have sent me another batch of little bottles to try. One of my favorite things about whisky in general (and scotch in particular) is that there are SO MANY whiskies to try that I’ve never had before. Even within a single distillery like Glenmorangie the products of which I’ve tasted extensively there is always another surprise bottle around the corner from an errant cask or special edition. This time it takes the form of a 17 year-old independent bottling from Exclusive Malts (distilled 1996 bottled 2014 at 56.1% ABV) with the vague moniker “North Highland”. A quick Google excursion tells me that it’s pretty much uncontested that this bottle is from a Glenmorangie refill sherry hogshead. The label likely obscures this with the “North Highland” designation for legal and/or marketing and/or “building a mystery” reasons. Queue the Sarah McLachlan.Alas as is often the case these days with cask-strength independent bottlings with any kind of age to them the price is astronomical. Let’s see if this is really worth $130 retail…Nose A sour tang like fino sherry but fruitier – unripe figs? Stewed peaches pits and all. Vanilla ice cream which does remind me of Glenmorangie. After a rest in the glass I can detect something like peach cobbler and buttery shortbread cookies but that sharp “fino” note pervades all.Palate Hot of course. Thin bodied. The sherry creeps in as a layer of fig and lemon still on the sour side. There is a nice body of malt with characteristic Glenmorangie shortbread and vanilla.Finish Medium-long and warming. Devoid of bitterness. The fruits become more subdued and are suggestive of fruit pies and jams. Roasted chestnuts fade to the end.With Water A sizable splash of water brings out an astoundingly clear note of bubblegum. The nose takes on a waxy aspect and the sour notes are reduced. The palate which is far milder retains the bubblegum and becomes a little blander. The finish acquires a slight menthol note. Definitely try this neat then add a few drops of water and then dilute it to around 50% for the full experience.Overall The “sharp” sour note on the nose definitely feels unbalanced. This is possibly an experimental cask that didn’t make it into one of the Glenmorangie special editions and was sold on the independent market. It reminds me somewhat of Artein but only as a single component. While like most Exclusive Malts it’s overpriced I can definitely see the appeal. This is a heady individualistic whisky and is exactly the kind of thing that people bored with the status quo of official bottlings are seeking especially fans of Glenmorangie. I still think the cask was refill fino sherry although that’s a stab in the dark.
161,Exclusive Malts: The Dalmore (13 year) 2000 – 2013 - First let’s establish something. I get sent samples sometimes and my first thought is “Yay! A new whisky to try!” and my second thought is “Yay! Another week’s blog post that I don’t have to buy whisky for!” Advertising on the blog pays for my whisky yes but what it does not pay for is a new bottle every week. Far from it. So once in awhile you dear reader get to put up with a review of something you’re never likely to see on a shelf. Them’s the breaks.So here’s a weirdo. Dalmore in my mind means two things Heavy sherry and orange-peel notes. This independently-bottled Dalmore from The Exclusive Malts was distilled in 2000 as cask #6952 and bottled in 2013 at 53.5% ABV. And it’s peated. What?!The color is super pale – nearly clear – which implies a refill bourbon cask. It’s possible this was a cask that previously held peated whisky but I can’t find any details online. Some way or some how a good whollop of peat found its way into this distinctly un-sherried Dalmore.Nose Peat but integrated well with vanilla and saltwater taffy. Hot-smoked salmon bitter herbs white pepper. Lavender.Palate Somewhat thin body. Barbeque coal smoke fresh-cracked pepper blackened salmon. Very low tongue-burn for something at 53.5% ABV.Finish Long. Herbal and smoky lavender especially. Mildly bitter but ends on a sweet vanilla note.With Water A few drops of water mute the nose or supplant the usual aromas with alcohol fumes. The palate might be softer and carries more tart notes – white vinegar? I would avoid the water here unless you feel you need to dilute it to bottle-strength (I don’t think it needs dilution).Overall There’s a lot going on in this one. It seems that Dalmore’s house characteristics are solely derived from its sherry aging because I would not be able to identify this as Dalmore if it weren’t for the label. It does have a Highland drift to the peat; instead of piquant smoke and overt seaweed the peat is herbal and reminds me of cooking aromas. A truly unusual take on both Dalmore malt AND Highland peated whisky. Well done.I won’t personally be buying a bottle of this but I can see how a fan of The Dalmore (who wants to see a new side of the distillery) or someone who appreciates alternative styles of peated malt would really enjoy this malt even at the hefty price of $99. This is a cautious “Recommended” if only for the education.
162,Ezra Brooks Straight Rye - Today we have yet another MGP/LDI sourced rye whisky. The main distinction here is that it’s bottled at a respectable 45% ABV instead of the minimum 40% has an age statement and is cheap as dirt. Is that a formula that makes a winning whiskey?The website for Ezra Brooks is littered with marketing gush that proclaims how “honest” and “straight-shooting” the products are which is a laugh because there is no Ezra Brooks distillery – the brand’s bourbons are distilled by parent company Luxco’s Lux Row distillery which also makes Rebel Yell David Nicholson and others. The ryes are sourced from Indiana which means LDI/MGP. The Straight Rye has a mash bill of 51% rye (45% corn 4% malted barley for enzymes) and an age statement of 24 months (2 years) which is required by law because it’s under 4 years.Still MGP makes some tasty whiskies and the Rebel Yell thing isn’t necessarily a knock against it because well Luxco didn’t actually make it. (Ouch.) Let’s see how it performs in the glassNose Spicy with a deep green eucalyptus or menthol note that is common with young rye. It smells so much like Vapo-Rub that I’m beginning to feel like I might have a cold. The green notes extend to grass and even asparagus. The rye spices are hard to discern between all the ferns and leaves but might consist of mace nutmeg and green peppercorn.Palate Syrupy body. Tongue burn is mild or moderate. Sweeter than I expected although the menthol and eucalyptus notes continue to the palate so now it tastes exactly like a menthol cough drop the kind with sweet cough syrup in the center.Finish Medium-long. I’ll let you take a guess. Ding ding! Menthol. Antiseptic grassy and I swear it’s actually clearing out my sinuses. Fades eventually although you still feel like you just chewed a eucalyptus cud.With Water A few drops of water release… oh dear God more menthol. Make it stop.Overall Seriously they could probably market this stuff as barrel-aged crème de menthe and not be far off the mark. I don’t expect a lot for $16 and those menthol notes can actually be useful when mixing a cocktail where you want to balance other sweet ingredients. Still drinking neat it’s hard to get over how medicinal this tastes. I feel like I’ve either been chewing on leaves like a koala or in bed with a sinus infection and a bag of cough drops.One easy way to get through a bottle of something like this is to mix a lot of whiskey sours. For some reason that menthol note really works well with lemon and sugar and produces a complex (instead of just grassy) cocktail. In fact if you’re in the shop looking for a mixer to make citrus + whisky cocktails for bottom dollar this will work just fine.I have to give it a score though and even though this is priced squarely where it belongs at $16 it isn’t what I’d call competitive in the space.
163,FEW Rye - Warning I apparently have some kind of genetic mutation that makes certain specific whiskies (or perhaps certain individual bottles) smell overwhelmingly of rotting banana. So much so that I can’t taste or smell much of anything else in the whisky. Given that these bottles are actually selling to people on a regular basis I have to assume that this experience is not universal. When this happens I always do a second tasting a day or more later to confirm that yes indeed this is awful. You may not have my genetic abnormality and may enjoy this rye so read this review with a grain of salt.One of the darlings of the craft whiskey renaissance in the US FEW Spirits makes an array of distilled drinks including gin rye bourbon grappa white dog (unaged whiskey) and American single malt. Located outside of Chicago in Evanston Illinois and named ironically after Frances Elizabeth Willard the hero of the Temperance movement who also hailed from Evanston FEW has garnered many awards and accolades for its “grain to glass” ethos and top-notch products. Their rye is made on a copper still from a mashbill of 70% rye 20% corn and 10% malted barley all from mid-western US growers and is aged around three years. Note that FEW’s gin is made on a second still to avoid “cross-contamination” of the gin botanicals into the whiskies.This particular sample collected from bottle in April 2015 was included in my Flaviar “Ryevolution” tasting box. Ironically that means it was distilled and aged in Illinois shipped to Europe poured into a glass vial sealed and shipped back to me in California. That’s bad news for my carbon footprint!Nose Overwhelming notes of banana custard verging on rotting banana. Even after a rest in the glass I get nothing except nose-numbing waves of banana. At last I can tease out a note of dusted cinnamon. But really this smells exactly like banana schnapps.Palate A few oaky notes up front some birch beer and maple syrup. Then it’s back to the All-Banana All-Day Show with Bananas Foster caramelized banana etc.Finish Short. What do you think? Bananas. Damn bananas. There’s also some hazelnut butter and dusty stale cinnamon.With Water Water has no appreciable effect on this that I can tell. Feel free to skip it.Overall This is the weirdest rye I’ve ever tasted. It’s very soft and has no bitter or off flavors but all of the flavors it does have are smothered in puréed banana. If I were tasting blind there’s no way I’d be able to tell you that this was rye. In fact I’m not certain I’d be able to tell you it was whiskey. If you do like banana flavors in whiskey you will LOVE this and I’d bet it would make a fascinating banana manhattan or banana old fashioned. If I liked banana.For me this is a resounding “Not Recommended” but in deference to my abnormal taste buds I’ll mark it “Try before Buy”. Please let me know if anyone else tastes way too much banana in this!
164,Filibuster “Dual Cask” Bourbon - If some of the below seems familiar that’s because I swiped it wholesale from my review of the “Dual Cask” rye. Sorry but sometimes I just phone it in. I may or may not be packing for a trip to Disneyland right now and I may or may not have time to devote to quality blog content. Equivocation is the sharpest arrow in a blogger’s quiver.There’s always this awful moment for a blogger when a package arrives in the mail from an upstart craft distillery. Obviously I need to maintain my illusory blogger credibility by thoroughly panning slop even if it’s free slop. When that happens though I have to email the poor PR rep or (worse) distillery employee and provide a link to my review of their hard work. This sort of thing can be very awkward. You can imagine my relief then when I open a free bottle and discover something tasty and easy-to-like inside. The Interwebs may decide that I’m full of it but at least I can sleep at night.Filibuster is a Virginia-based distillery that (ironically) started out as a blending house with no plans to distill. Then I can only imagine the inexorable draw as the craft whiskey industry sang its siren song (yes these are the kinds of things I sit in front of my computer and imagine) and the company purchased a defunct apple processing plant in the Shenandoah valley in Virginia and began installing stills. As is the case with just about every other distillery or “distillery” opened this decade the liquid is not quite ready to barrel yet. Best guess they started distilling in 2017 so we can expect real Filibuster juice around about 2021. Until then Filibuster bottles contain sourced whiskey and have since they started producing in 2013.For what it’s worth the distillery has a continuous still and is aging in 53-gallon kiln-dried new American Oak at their facility in Virginia. They are sourcing local grains (indeed from farms in the same Zip code) and even publish the farms where the grains are grown. None of that matters yet because what we have here is no-name bourbon from somewhere. Where? The back of the bottle says “Distilled in Virginia and Indiana” so if we take this at face value it’s probably MGP bourbon with some of the distillery’s own (very young) output mixed in? There are a number of other distilleries in Virginia so it could be sourced from any of them. The website suggests that this “less than four year old” (uhh… so two year-old the legal minimum) straight bourbon is from a mixture of old and young casks with an average age of 4-6 years. The mash bill appears to have changed from batch to batch as well which implies that the sourcing has changed. This bottle is from a 70% sweet corn 20% rye and 10% malted barley mash bill. The twist though is that the vatted bourbon is finished for an additional rest of two or three months in California “wine-seasoned” (both red and white) French Oak barrels.Oh yeah it’s called Filibuster because it’s made just outside of Washington D.C. Yuk Yuk.My bottle is from Batch #27 and is bottled at 45% ABV. Aside from the rye Filibuster also produces a wine-finished blend of bourbon and rye called Boondoggler. Thanks to Annie for the generous samples!Nose A little shyer than the rye with a distinct pine resin note that likely derives from the rye grain component in the mash. A rest in the glass intensifies the pine a bit and reveals only a shimmer of jammy fruit. Overall impression is dry and dusty.Palate Syrupy body. Moderate tongue burn. There are flecks of maple syrup and a rash of oaky sweetness that rids it of dryness but there’s not a lot of complexity otherwise. Faint woodsmoke and fainter dusty rye spices.Finish Medium-short. Back to being dry with echoes of spice (now I get some of that clove and cinnamon I was expecting) and some barrel tannin. Not too bitter but not particularly complex. There are some nutty notes (hazelnut or walnut) on the fade-out.With Water A few drops of water coax out peanut butter vanilla and more maple and smother the pine resin notes. This gives the aroma better balance and some kind of identity. The palate retains its sweetness and the finish seems a little more alive. Water is highly recommended with this one.Overall A shy bourbon with hints of interesting flavors and aromas that never quite announce themselves although a splash of water helps. The bourbon starts dry becomes lightly sweet across the tongue and then flees. The wine finish is so much in the background that it almost disappears. This is far less successful than the rye which I thoroughly enjoyed.
165,Filibuster “Dual Cask” Rye - There’s always this awful moment for a blogger when a package arrives in the mail from an upstart craft distillery. Obviously I need to maintain my illusory blogger credibility by thoroughly panning slop even if it’s free slop. When that happens though I have to email the poor PR rep or (worse) distillery employee and provide a link to my review of their hard work. This sort of thing can be very awkward.

They are sourcing local grains (indeed from farms in the same Zip code) and even publish the farms where the grains are grown. None of that matters yet because what we have here is no-name rye from somewhere (MGP? Who knows there’s no hint on the bottle). The twist though is that this two year-old rye (a 90% rye / 10% malted barley mash bill) is finished for an additional two years in “white wine seasoned” French Oak barrels. The initial two years gives it the right to be called “Straight Rye Whiskey” and the second two years means it’s four years of age for our purposes.Oh yeah it’s called Filibuster because it’s made just outside of Washington D.C. Yuk Yuk.My bottle is from Batch #8 and is bottled at 45% ABV. Thanks to Annie for the generous samples!Nose Soft round spicy rye with a big heaping of grape jam. Bright fruity and with scattered elements of apple cider berry preserves and an undercurrent of cracked black pepper cloves and caraway. This has moderate depth but very well-balanced fruits and spice. A rest in the glass brings additional sweetness like sugar glaze on a cinnamon roll.Palate Medium bodied. Rye spices jump to the fore with the aforementioned clove plus powdered cinnamon dried apples and gingerbread. A mild tongue burn barely interrupts the almost Christmas-y flavors.Finish Medium length. A reprise of the same flavors plus a little bit of bitterness and a dusting of charcoal which adds a little smokiness. Finishes without evolving much.With Water A few drops of water open up a bit more alcohol (“nose tickle”) and a tart high note like kiwi or green grapes. The water also amps the tongue burn and thins the body. The water is not really required here.Overall Pleasant but with enough spice to give it an edge. The finish in wine barrels has laden the aroma with layer upon layer of fresh fruits which are balanced nicely by rye spice notes. The whole gets a little muddier on the palate losing some of the fruit but the experience remains positive through the end. Probably some extra years (pre-wine cask) would tighten up that midpalate but $40 is already at the upper end of what the market will bear for young sourced rye even as well-finished as this and the West Coast sees distribution of this at the not-ideal price of $55.Recommended. Although it might be a “Must Try” if you’re in the market for a tasty rye and you like a little fruit with your rye spices.
166,Filibuster Boondoggler Whiskey - You have no idea how tempted I was to clone (once again) the previous Filibuster reviews since all of that verbiage applies here and fills up a nice chunk of blog real-estate. After tasting both the Filibuster Rye and the Bourbon which are both sourced (for now) the Boondoggler is in a kind of no-man’s land between them.When a bottle label says that it was a “small batch” of whiskey “aged in 5 different barrels” my mind automatically Google Translates that into “made from leftover barrels that we didn’t know what to do with.” That may or may not be fair but I just write a blog so I don’t have to be fair. Apparently the blend started as a personal project for the owner who wanted a house blend of his own products. The story goes that the result was “so good” that they decided to bottle it and sell it. For less than their other products. Sure.The casks used include new American white oak both red and white wine seasoned French oak and both Fino and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. In case you were wondering what “seasoned” means it means they took (probably) old casks and filled them up with bulk wine or sherry (which could have been re-used for this purpose) and then either sloshed them around inside or let them sit for a few weeks to soak. This is pretty common in the industry across the world these days especially as real fresh sherry casks become harder to find and more expensive. It’s also the only way to acquire casks for wines that are usually un-aged like riesling or sauvignon blanc.The whiskey in question is a combination of sourced whiskey from Virginia and Indiana just like their bourbon but this bottle does not have “bourbon” on the label. This could be due to a variety of reasons. For example if the percentage of corn in the original mash bill is below 51% it cannot be called bourbon. If some of the liquid did not spend time (any amount of time) in new charred oak… for example if it were aged only in re-used casks or wine casks then it cannot be called bourbon. Lastly if all of the components that went into the blend could not be labelled as “bourbon” individually then the blend cannot either. I’m guessing this is a blend of bourbon and rye hence the label restriction or that they didn’t want to do the paperwork on all of those casks.The resulting blend of whiskies is bottled at 45% ABV. My bottle is from batch #20.Nose The piney note from the Bourbon is here as well along with a fruit punch / bubblegum note. A rest in the glass helps to integrate these and brings out a rock candy syrup aroma.Palate Thin body. A moderate tongue burn is followed by more fruit punch and bubblegum as well as corn syrup and oaky furniture polish. Some mouth-drying tannins and no off-notes but not particularly complex.Finish Medium length. The pine note returns and puckering tannins continue to dry the mouth and lips. No bitterness but also no evolution. Fades with a hint of grape skins.With Water A few drops of water adds some tartness to the already-tart fruit punch notes. The water also adds some processed-sugar (cheap candy) notes to the palate and finish. I don’t suggest adding water to this.Overall This doesn’t really speak to me. The wine barrels do contribute some fruit notes but they seem confused and not well-integrated. The rye which was so expressive by itself is lost in the fog here. Still it’s a fun little whiskey and the price is right if you can find it under $30 but a current scan of retail spots on the Internet shows prices around $35. I would pay $25 for another bottle. I would not pay $35. I’m marking this “Try Before Buy” unless you can find it on the cheap.Of the three Filibuster whiskies that I’ve tried the rye is my favorite.
167,Finlaggan Old Reserve - Finlaggan is a conundrum. Bottles from the Finlaggan brand (a product of the “Vintage Malt Whisky Company Ltd.”) contain a single malt from an Islay distillery. The company keeps a very tight lid on the identity of its source breaking silence only to insist that Finlaggan does now always has and always will contain whisky from the same distillery. If we are to believe the company we must trust our nose and not our ears in order to divine the secrets of this pale liquid. A favorite topic of whisky forums the identity of Finlaggan’s source is thought to be Lagavulin Laphroaig Ardbeg or Caol Ila. It’s very likely that the OR (Old Reserve) contains younger whisky – perhaps in the 6 year range – although a bottling of 10 year-old is available in some markets.The fascination with this whisky comes primarily from its absurdly low price. A bottle at my local Trader Joe’s (the primary reseller of Finlaggan in the U.S.) costs $18. This makes it by a wide margin the cheapest single-malt available to me. The astounding part is that it’s actually QUITE GOOD. A good peat-forward single malt for $18 a bottle? Mystery aside that makes Finlaggan a rarity in a world where Ardbeg can sell out of $100 bottles of 10 year-old malts named after reptiles.Finlaggan itself is named after the ruins of Finlaggan Castle a historic site on Loch Finlaggan on Islay which was the residence of The Lords of the Isles.Finlaggan OR (Old Reserve)Color Very pale in color.Nose Concentrated smoke. Grill-blackened mushrooms. Charcoal. The peatiness is intense in a very campfire-smoke way. Underneath the smoke lies a layer of sugary malt sweetness – not complex but undeniably malty. The Islay character is clear but there is little maritime influence. A few drops of water intensify the smoke but also release a little lemon peel and green apple.Palate Medium body. Alcohol burn upfront betrays its youth. Evolves into rice vinegar sour candies silty water fresh green moss and a pervading bitter smokiness. A few drops of water goes a long way to tame the alcohol. The water also brings out a little bit of vague fruit.Finish Long and with an interesting flavor like sweet-and-sour or Margarita mix. Fades into simple slightly bitter smoke and wet ashes.Clearly a young heavily peated malt from Islay. The indistinct maritime flavors suggest that it might not have matured in seaside warehouses or perhaps used inland peat? The remaining flavors are muddy and lean towards the bitter. Despite these negative characteristics this is a powerful peaty dram of single malt for under $20. For that price and this range of interesting flavors it’s hard not to recommend. If you don’t like peat avoid this bottle. If you’ve developed a refined taste for well-aged peated malts avoid this bottle. However if you’re curious definitely locate a Trader Joe’s with an alcohol license near you and pick some up.My theory? I think it’s young Ardbeg. The lemony “Margarita Mix” flavors and lack of a dominant seaweediness or saltiness remind me of Corryvreckan although this is obviously a far cry from that superb dram. I just don’t get those warm unctuous savory Lagavulin notes. Many informed whisky drinkers are sure that it’s six year-old Lagavulin. Either way this is very good stuff for a very good price and I think the mystery adds something to the experience.
168,Forty Creek Barrel Select - You might remember my blind tasting of Té Bheag blended scotch in which a reader sent me a blind sample to review. Well thanks again to Scott N. for a second sample this time in a miniature bottle simply marked “Canadian” – at least I get a clue this time. 🙂As before I don’t normally taste things blind. For one reason anyone who pretends to know anything about wine beer spirits etc. knows to avoid blind tastings like the plague because they have a way of revealing exactly how full of crap we are. For example at a recent tasting group I attended 24 whisky enthusiasts had two chances to guess the origin of a mystery pour for an opportunity to win a bottle. It turned out to be Johnnie Walker Green Label (which is now back on shelves after a hiatus) and nobody even got close. At a similar event last year nobody was even able to guess that a blind pour was rum instead of whisky!This sample smelled blindingly sweet (so I could guess low-end Canadian blend) and the color was a very dark red-gold. After a taste my best guess was one of the Crown Royal special editions. Surprise! It was Forty Creek’s Barrel Select the entry-level product from the upstart Canadian distillery. As it’s positioned as a direct competitor to the entry-level Crown Royal the flavor profile makes sense. It definitely tastes like a “higher end” Crown for not much more money. It’s also cheap enough to mix with. Forty Creek ages their copper pot-still components (rye corn and barley) in separate barrels and then carefully blends them together for the final product an unusual approach. I’m also looking forward to tasting some of the celebrated higher-end products from the distillery. Or am I?Please remember that these notes were written while tasting blind which show clearly that I don’t really know what the heck I’m talking about.Nose Initially heavy new-make character (grassy vegetal reminds me of white dog) – that dissipates after a rest in the glass leaving a thick layer of caramel with buttercream frosting and a thin veneer of tannic oak. Vanilla pervades while the caramel is verging on burnt caramel with wisps of char.Palate Thick sweet syrupy. Did I mention sweet? Repeated caramel notes butterscotch candies dulce de leche etc. It all tastes heavily sweet but not in a fake/corn syrup way.Finish Medium-short in length. Initially vanilla dominates and then gives way to coconut extract and marzipan (almond). No bitterness.With Water A few drops of water release a little cinnamon (now it smells like a Cinna-Bon) and perhaps thins the body a touch.Overall Like many cheaper Canadian whiskies this is over-the-top sugary sweet. The effect is decadent rather than fake (a major plus) reminding me of a high-end bakery treats rather than cheap mass-produced candy. Aside from the various iterations of sugar there’s just a little bit of oakiness and not much complexity. A dessert – something that might be good poured over ice cream.I’m marking this as “Try Before Buy” because it’s a little too young and a little too sweet for my tastes. However if you regularly drink Crown Royal this is a MUST HAVE for you. Yes you I’m talking to you. Don’t try to hide in the back.
169,Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve - What better way to start out the new decade than tasting something that has sat in the back of my whisky cabinet an embarrassing 5 years? I have a habit of doing this on the blog; I hoard bottles and samples and then take way too long to get around to reviewing them. I would be ashamed if I had any kind of journalistic integrity or even any sense of responsibility to my readers. Thankfully I have neither so here we go.Forty Creek’s Confederation Oak Reserve was making noise in whisky circles a half-decade ago. “The rebirth of Canadian whisky” and similar phrases were bandied about. I regret now that I didn’t taste it at the time because maybe the heady air of mass shared public delusion might have improved the experience. Also before you start digging out your Dixie flags note that the “Confederation” in the title refers to the Confederation of Canada in 1867. Forty Creek ages their copper pot-still components (rye corn and barley) in separate barrels and then carefully blends them together for the final product an unusual approach. In this case after blending the whiskies are married – meaning aged – “up to 2 years” (a phrase I heartily dislike because one day qualifies as “up to 2 years”) in new Canadian oak barrels. The oak trees used are harvested from forests near the distillery in Grimsby Ontario and are estimated to be around 150 years old. That would make them – drumroll high-hat – about as old as Canada’s Confederacy. Ta-da! Confederation Oak.The resulting whisky is bottled without an age statement at the legal minimum of 40% ABV. I’m happy to see that newer bottle labels took care of one of my gripes about the original bottle design for Confederation Oak The giant number “40” on the front which naive consumers could be forgiven for reading as “40 years”. For an example see the bottle image above. A 40 year-old whisky for $55 would be something indeed. Newer labels omit the “40”.Confederation Oak Reserve does still appear on store shelves so this review isn’t totally useless although there’s no telling what might have changed – aside from the label – in the 5 years since my bottle was filled. I had reasonably nice things to say about the entry-level Barrel Select although that one is intended to compete with $20 Canadian blends on the bottom shelf.I picked up my 750ml bottle back in 2015 for a whopping $55 a bottle – quite a stretch for a Canadian mass-market release – and if for some reason it matters my bottle is #04325 from Lot 1867-D.Nose Distinctly Canadian whisky. Sweet – a ton of brown sugar honey and molasses accompanied by a twang of medicinal grain alcohol a cross between middling vodka and rubbing alcohol. After a rest in the glass some of the ‘rubbing alcohol’ has dissipated revealing sweet baked goods (“snickerdoodle” cookies) vanilla buttercream frosting and sweet corn.Palate Soft silky body. Very low tongue burn (apropos for 40%) with those same sweet baked goods up-front on the palate. These are accompanied by mild black licorice (anise) corn pudding butterscotch frosting mildly bitter oak and faint dusty charcoal.Finish Medium length. The mild oak becomes mildly tannic – mouth drying – and the bitterness continues but is still balanced by the remaining sweet notes (brown sugar mostly). Fades without evolving.With Water A few drops of water increase the nose tickle without improving the complexity. The palate feels thinner – indeed watery – although the finish is a little sweeter. Skip the water.Overall I’m not quite sure what all the fuss was about five years ago. This is categorically Canadian whisky by its soft mouth feel and dominant sweet notes but it suffers the same downsides that less-expensive Canadian blends suffer excessive ‘rubbing alcohol’ aromas flat one-dimensional palate notes and a vaguely bitter finish. I liked Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye about 100 times more than this (and it’s half the price) and although as an all-rye product instead of a blend it’s not a fair comparison I liked Lot 40 100% rye more than both of those.If you like your whiskies sweet and uncomplicated get the Crown Royal above. If you like to pay double for the same experience then this Forty Creek was MADE for you. Or I suppose if you feel you must taste a whisky partially aged in 150 year-old Canadian oak there’s no better chance. In that case though look for a glass of it at a bar rather than dropping $55 – $70 on a bottle.
170,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch Bourbon – 2015 - Every year around mid-September Four Roses releases the coveted Limited Editions A vintage-dated Single Barrel and Small Batch. However as of 2015 due to shortages of older stock only the Limited Edition Small Batch will be released. 2015 also marks another transition at Four Roses Legendary Master Distiller and American whiskey celebrity Jim Rutledge will be retiring this Fall. That makes the 2015 Limited Edition Small Batch the last limited release made under Jim’s direction. This fact combined with the already ferocious demand for aged bourbon will make 2015’s release especially hard to come by. Try not to get hurt in the stampede!If you do secure a bottle you’re in for a treat. A mixture of 4 different bourbons using 3 recipes (out of the 10 Four Roses recipes) at unusually high ages 16 year-old OBSK 11 year-old OBSV 15 year-old OESK and 14 year-old OESK. To compare the 2014 edition contained 13 year-old OBSV 12 year-old OESV 11 year-old OBSF and 9 year-old OBSK.Four Roses proudly uses only non-GMO corn which is surprisingly (and expensive!) in this age of mass commodity production of corn. Good on you Four Roses.Thanks to Laura Baddish of The Baddish Group who kindly sent me an advance tasting sample.Nose Potent! Bright sweet notes of candied orange peel contrast with deep notes of toasty cereal grains oatmeal cookies sticky oak resin and shellac. Something sweet as well – fresh homemade toffee.Palate Fiery. After setting the surface of my tongue ablaze it finally resolves into chocolate-covered cherries graham crackers (or gingerbread?) orange bitters and butterscotch syrup.Finish Long. After the fire subsides roasted nuts and silky oak tannins (not a hint of bitterness) coat the mouth. Fades with dried coconut shavings.With Water Several drops of water open up some honeysuckle orange flower water and makes the sugary notes more round and full. Not only does the water also make the bourbon more palatable on the tongue (taste-bud fires are now at a minimum) it reveals a wider array of oaky and brown sugar notes plus a delectable vanilla crème brûlée. Water is a MUST with this.Overall Everything you expect in a well-made bourbon but with each individual component turned up to 11. At the bottling strength of 54.25% it’s hard to get a grasp on what’s going on beyond all the alcohol burn so I highly recommend taming this with a little water to really appreciate the palate and get the most out of the aroma. If you can’t stand the idea of adding water at least let it open up in the glass for several minutes. This is the kind of bourbon that you pour sit back and enjoy slowly over the course of a quiet evening.I’ve marked this a “Must Try” not because I think you have much of a chance of laying your hands on a glass of this (let alone a bottle) nor that it’s necessarily worth the North-of-$100 price tag but because I urge you to someday find and taste a Four Roses limited edition to see how refined flavorful and robust a masterfully crafted well-aged bourbon can be.
171,Four Roses Single Barrel Bourbon - I keep getting recommendations for Four Roses bourbon. After now trying the Yellow Label Small Batch and now Single Barrel I can see what the fuss is about. Four Roses excels not at making “the best” bourbon but at making an affordable range of solid consistent (actually consistent) and widely-available bourbon. This is the kind of bourbon that you can settle down with start a life and stop window shopping for the next big bourbon craze. If you really only have room in your cabinet for one sipping bourbon you couldn’t go far wrong with something from Four Roses.I have yet to try either of the Limited Edition bourbons largely because they’re among the priciest of the current flock of premium American whiskies and I can’t bring myself to plonk down $80 to $100 for untasted bourbon… even if I could find a bottle on a shelf somewhere before it sells out. I do keep hearing that it’s excellent however.The Single Barrel Bourbon from Four Roses is Kentucky Straight Bourbon and an OBSV recipe which means 60% corn 35% rye and 5% malted barley. This is their “high rye” recipe. The ‘V’ letter indicates one of their five strains of yeast which is responsible for a lot of the fruity notes. Four Roses is amazingly upfront about the content of their whisky and I heartily encourage you to explore their website. The Single Barrel is bottled at an impressive 50% ABV – not quite cask strength but still able to cause a whopping sizzle on the taste buds. There is no age statement but the 2004 press release announced that it was “at least” 7 years old.Four Roses proudly uses only non-GMO corn which is surprisingly (and expensive!) in this age of mass commodity production of corn. Good on you Four Roses.Also – this is adorable – the 50ml glass miniature that I’m tasting has its own tiny little cork. Aww!Nose Hot! High rye spices crushed mint (oh wow I want a julep right now) wood char (which I can’t usually smell) black pepper. There’s a LOT going on in this nose but the high ABV makes it a challenge to contemplate.Palate Light brown sugar. Already I can taste barrel tannin slightly acerbic. Hot on the tongue but carries waves of cinnamon red hots brown sugar cookies freshly-grated ginger and white pepper.Finish Long. A reprise of the spices from the aroma along with some cherry lozenge. Fades on the cherry note.With Water Water if possible makes the nose more spicy with nuances of nutmeg and allspice. Finishes slightly sweeter. Water definitely helps with the intense burn.Overall A big bourbon with a lot to offer. High rye mashbill and the resulting “spice cabinet” really permeates the experience. If you like baking spices in your whisky you will LOVE this. Definitely try it with a slug of water if only to get it down around 46%.
172,Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon - Four Roses has a pretty solid following. Often on forums and in discussions with whiskey fans I hear offhand statements like “this is a little like Four Roses which is my favorite bourbon.” That’s a pretty strong recommendation for a bourbon that’s readily available and doesn’t have the trappings of mystique like Pappy Van Winkle or the respectability of craft producers like High West and Tuthilltown. My review of the “plastic jug” Yellow Label was actually pretty positive. Four Roses Small Batch comes from the distiller’s 75%-20% (corn-to-rye) recipe and is bottled at 45% ABV after approximately 8 years of maturation. The “small batch” refers to a limited selection of barrels that are “batched” or vatted together to achieve a specific flavor profile. This one comes in at around $30 a bottle which makes it comparable to (and somewhat cheaper than) other “small batch” bourbon releases. Don’t confuse this with the “Limited Edition” small batch which is far more expensive.Four Roses proudly uses only non-GMO corn which is surprisingly (and expensive!) in this age of mass commodity production of corn. Good on you Four Roses.Nose Spice. Lots and lots of black pepper. Black licorice. Mulling spices but mostly black pepper.Palate Full-bodied and corn heavy with lots of molasses. Suddenly it’s all sweetness and wood. Where are the spices?Finish Caramel Apple! Some milk chocolate. Much better finish than palate. Finally trails off with some cinnamon.With Water BIG Spice comes through on the nose and the water wakes up some cayenne. Thins the body somewhat and kills the finish. Try it once with water but in general this bourbon doesn’t need it.Overall A respectable rye-recipe bourbon with some big bold flavors. It’s not often that I’m able to identify bourbon notes other than cinnamon and spice (from the rye) corn syrup (from the corn) and charcoal (from the toasted barrels). Here I find black pepper on the nose and delights like caramel apple and milk chocolate on the finish. The only downside is the relatively one-note palate which is all corn syrup and barrel char. For that reason I’d order this at a bar but I wouldn’t make it my staple home bourbon. Still for under $40 this stands up well to the competition.
173,Four Roses Yellow Label Bourbon - Bourbon for me is a funny animal. Pappy tastes like Pappy rye tastes spicy and everything else ends up with the same tasting notes corn syrup cinnamon and wood. With scotch I find that the range of flavors is wide and each dram has a lot of deep or subtle notes that can be teased out and written about. Every bourbon I taste gives me the same three-note writeup. Clearly this is a failing of my own since “the whisky people” (as I call them) are universally championing the cause of American whiskey and everybody seems to love the stuff.It was with this trepidation that I approached a K&L tasting of Four Roses bourbon. Knowing that the Yellow Label is sold in plastic liter jugs didn’t help. I learned that distiller Jim Rutledge at Four Roses has implemented a system whereby the distillery uses 2 different mashbills (60% corn/35% rye and 75% corn/20% rye) and five different yeast strains yielding a possible 10 recipes. It is from these recipes that each of their labels and brands are made. I also learned that Yellow Label actually – surprise! – tastes good. In a blind tasting I would have associated this with some $30 bourbons I’ve had – not the top of the heap by any stretch but certainly drinkable straight. That’s not bad for bottom shelf.This particular label uses a recipe with 28-29% rye content which is much higher than competitive products. Four Roses proudly uses only non-GMO corn which is surprisingly (and expensive!) in this age of mass commodity production of corn. Good on you Four Roses.Nose Lots of corn. Warm & spicy with toasted spices like caraway and ground cinnamon. Yeasty – like baking bread.Palate Anise. A little bitter some acetone? Wood & more spices. Some nice red-hots.Finish Warming but now reveals itself as a little cheap through some rough young alcohol.Overall Not as bad as I thought for a bottom-shelfer. I would pick this over similarly-priced products.
174,Gentleman Jack Tennessee Whiskey - What is Gentleman Jack? Just about every American of age can spot the distinctive black-and-white bottle of Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey from across a bar. Tennessee Whiskey technically a subset of bourbon which is defined as straight bourbon whiskey produced in the state of Tennessee is advertised by the companies that make it as distinct from bourbon due to a charcoal “mellowing” process. Much as Irish whiskey in the mid-20th century sought to distinguish itself from Scotch by changing the spelling of ‘whiskey’ bottles of most Tennessee whiskey do not include the word ‘bourbon’.The Lincoln County Process (Tennessee whiskey was previously a product of Lincoln County Tennessee) involves the percolating of new-make spirit through a thick layer (up to 12 feet) of American sugar maple charcoal. This process essentially a natural charcoal filter removes some of the harsher alcohol flavors and some volatile esters from the spirit (some might argue it also removes some flavor). The whiskey is then matured in American white oak barrels in the same manner as bourbon.Despite all the marketing nonsense aimed at bourbon consumers who are seeking more luxury products Gentleman Jack is simply Jack Daniels whiskey which is filtered through the layer of charcoal twice. I’m not personally a fan of regular Jack Daniels whiskey as it provokes in me the dreaded “shudder” effect. Here’s what I thought of Gentleman JackNose Warm sweet notes of cherry pink peppercorn orange peel and charred fruitwood.Palate Medium body – like soft water – vague top notes with perhaps some anise black pepper and something vegetative like raw sugar cane.Finish Of medium length mostly creamed corn and root beer hard candies. Clove and cinnamon left on tongue.Overall This reminds me of plain old Knob Creek perhaps because of the warming cherry tones and muted sugars. I will admit freely that this tastes smoother and better than Jack Daniels’ regular offering. If you’re a Jack fan give this a try but there are plenty of better American whiskies available on the market at similar prices.
175,George Dickel (No. 12) Tennessee Whisky - The George Dickel brand is best known as the “other” Tennessee Whiskey. Without going into the whole thing here I’ll summarize by saying Tennessee Whiskey is straight bourbon whiskey (but don’t call it bourbon) that has been filtered through some quantity of sugar-maple charcoal. George Dickel owned by Diageo takes the extra step of chilling the whiskey before performing the filtering. This practice called ‘chill filtration’ is now generally avoided by modern scotch producers who have found that consumers prefer not to have flavor compounds filtered out of their high-end whiskies. Dickel claims the chill-filtration through charcoal “mellows” the whiskey removing harsh flavors. Maybe. Who knows. It certainly worked out in their rye.George Dickel’s lineup includes several Tennessee whiskies including a “No. 8” which is comparable to Jack Daniel’s “Old No. 7” in the black bottle a “No. 12” (this one) which includes older whisky in the blend and an extra 5% bottling strength a Bottled-in-Bond 13-year and a small batch “Barrel Select”. The Tennessee whiskies are all made at Dickel’s historic Cascade Hollow Distillery near Tullahoma Tennessee from a mash bill of 84% corn 8% rye and 8% malted barley. The “No. 12” (which has a large 12 on the label something that I consider to be confusing for people accustomed to seeing ages of maturation so prominently featured) is actually aged between 6 and 8 years and bottled at 45% ABV. It is chill-filtered through sugar maple charcoal like the rest of Dickel’s whiskies.Nose Oddly grassy with notes of fresh-mown grass as well as something like pickle juice or sauerkraut. I’m now so preoccupied with the thought of pickle-flavored whiskey that I can’t detect anything else. Luckily the pickle note dissipates with a rest in the glass leaving plain old green grass behind.Palate Soft medium-bodied… almost heavy. A strong tongue burn is followed by an assortment of hard candies cinnamon red hots hay bales lemon peel and floor wax.Finish Finally some oak with mild drying tannins and very little bitterness. Not particularly sweet and a bit one-dimensional. Fades without evolving.With Water Several drops of water seem to have no effect on the aroma or palate although it might make the finish a little sweeter. Water is optional here.Overall Uhh. Well it’s probably better than Jack Daniels (which admittedly I haven’t had in years) but the combination of flavors is a little off-putting. Despite the low price I can think of a number of regular old non-Tennessee whiskies that I’d rather drink Four Roses 1792 Buffalo Trace Evan Williams Old Bardstown and even Wild Turkey 101. In fact the George Dickel rye (made by MGP) is the same price and is far better in every way. Get that instead.
176,George Dickel Bottled In Bond Tennessee Whiskey - Apologies because the below prose was mostly copied from my recent Dickel No. 12 review but it’s all still relevant and I am at heart a lazy person. Usually I let a good couple of months go by between blatant self-plagiarizing but I just had to post this review immediately once I tasted it. It has been a long long while since I opened a new bottle and found something warranting the “Must Have” tag. I have been jaded and disillusioned by the modern whisky industry which I find to be full of noise with little substance. It was thus a welcome kick in the ass to discover that I could still be surprised by a bottle that retails for $35.The George Dickel brand is best known as the “other” Tennessee Whiskey. Without going into the whole thing here I’ll summarize by saying Tennessee Whiskey is straight bourbon whiskey (but don’t call it bourbon) that has been filtered through some quantity of sugar-maple charcoal.

Dickel claims the chill-filtration through charcoal “mellows” the whiskey removing harsh flavors. Maybe. Who knows.

The Tennessee whiskies are all made at Dickel’s historic Cascade Hollow Distillery near Tullahoma Tennessee from a mash bill of 84% corn 8% rye and 8% malted barley.This Bottled-in-Bond batch from the Fall 2005 distilling season was aged for 13 years and is bottled at the required 50% ABV. It is chill-filtered through sugar maple charcoal like the rest of Dickel’s whiskies.Nose Sweet fruity floral and flecked with oak. We’re off to a good start. The fruit is plentiful mixed berry jam kiwi rhubarb red delicious apple and fresh plums. There is also a popped corn aroma some light caramel and the smell that you get when you open a fresh bag of hardwood lump charcoal. This is delivered along with a strong nose tickle so don’t stick your nose too deep in the glass.Palate Thin body. The fruit – especially the jam – continues onto the palate. After a brief but intense tongue burn – it is 100 proof after all – there is soft corn sweet honeyed cornbread mild oaky tannins and more. Quite complex.Finish Long. The fruit – now with some balsamic-like density – continues through the finish and evolves into licorice drops red pepper jelly charcoal without bitterness and vague wafting smoke like a newly-lit campfire. This lasts for surprisingly long (for a corn whiskey). Excellent.With Water A few drops of water add candy corn and vanilla ice cream to the aroma and palate without taking anything away. The burn seems less intense but the finish is slightly more vegetal (grassy). Try both without and then with water.Overall Wow. This stuff is legit. 13 years of aging prominent fruit notes without undue bitterness that last from nose to finish all for $35? This has just become my new favorite under-$50 bourbon. As long as it retains its age statement it will sit alongside Eagle Rare 10 year as my house Tennessee Whiskey. I think the Eagle Rare is a little more polished with fewer eclectic notes and more focus but this new Dickel is bursting with complexity and I love some fruit character in my American whiskey. I’m sold. In fact I’m going to go get a few more bottles.
177,George Dickel Rye - The George Dickel brand is best known as the “other” Tennessee Whiskey. Without going into the whole thing here I’ll summarize by saying Tennessee Whiskey is straight bourbon whiskey (but don’t call it bourbon) that has been filtered through some quantity of sugar-maple charcoal. George Dickel owned by Diageo takes the extra step of chilling the whiskey before performing the filtering. This practice called ‘chill filtration’ is now generally avoided by modern scotch producers who have found that consumers prefer not to have flavor compounds filtered out of their high-end whiskies. Dickel claims the chill-filtration through charcoal “mellows” the whiskey removing harsh flavors. Maybe. Who knows.Here we have something different. This is not actually a bourbon (nor a Tennessee Whiskey like the Dickel No. 12 or the 13-year Bottled in Bond) but rather a MGP-distilled (that would be in Indiana) 95% rye whiskey that has been subjected to the above charcoal chill-filtration process. I am now obliged to point out the bald-faced hypocrisy of a label that trumpets the “…traditions and craftsmanship that make our Tennessee whisky world famous” when the contents of the bottle were in fact distilled in Indiana. Still this is par for the course in the modern American whiskey industry and nobody should be surprised. Speaking of MGP that 95% rye mash bill (the other 5% is malted barley for enzymes) can also be found in James E. Pepper 1775 rye Redemption rye Rebel Yell Small Batch rye Bulleit ryes Angel’s Envy rye Templeton rye and the discontinued Smooth Ambler rye among others.Still none of the above producers are chill-filtering that MGP rye through 13 feet of maple charcoal so we at least owe the bottle a proper amount of consideration. The bottle is 45% ABV and retails for a very respectable $20-ish.Nose A little hot and very spicy. Clove and cardamom pop first and then a bed of cinnamon oaky vanilla pine sap and apple cider vinegar. A rest in the glass turns the vinegar into fresh apple cider.Palate Medium-bodied. Again somewhat hot with a cinnamon-flecked burn that slowly mellows into marshmallow wood polish orange peel cherry syrup and apple compote.Finish Medium-long. Tart with a swath of lemon juice and cherry which gives way to slightly bitter charcoal that my label-influenced mind is telling me tastes like maple. Fades without further evolution.With Water Several drops of water bring out a grassy note and a bunch of anise (licorice) on both the aroma and the flavor. It doesn’t seem to affect the tongue burn. I don’t think this benefits from water but it won’t hurt it either.Overall There’s nothing particularly unusual about the notes in this rye but what’s exceptional is that the notes that count are the ones that pop most. The fresh fruit the tartness and the not-at-all-stale spices are always in the forefront. A good rest in the glass makes this rye smell exactly like mulled apple cider. Very very nice for a bottom-shelfer. This compares favorably with my rye standards Hochstadter’s and Rittenhouse 100. Those two probably have the edge in terms of overall quality for the price but this particular MGP rye is at least as tasty.Maybe they’re on to something with that charcoal chill-filtration. If so that means chill-filtration is GOOD and my whole life is a lie.
178,Glen Garioch Founder’s Reserve - I always have a little trepidation when trying a distillery’s whisky for the first time. I don’t know what to expect – will it be bland and uninteresting? Will it be unique and require me to mentally add a new category to my “types of whisky” catalog? Will I have to come up with new words to describe it? This is my first Glen Garioch (usually pronounced ‘Glen Gee-ree’ which is probably not quite right Scots-Gaelic-wise). The ‘Founder’s Reserve’ is the baseline malt for this distillery and is bottled at the unusual choice of 48% ABV without chill-filtration after maturation in ex-bourbon casks. There is no age statement but it’s probably around 8 years of age. It retails for $44 which I consider to be a respectable price in the current overheated whisky market.Nose Elegant and nuanced. While the aroma is of a classically American oak-matured malt without any of the trappings of cask finishing there is a lot of depth here. Vanilla in fine balance with lemon peel and a faint fruitiness like white raspberries. The required butterscotch/caramel notes are present and not at all cloying. The alcohol nose tickle comes across as tart rather than chemical. Very nice.Palate Medium-bodied with a initial hefty rush of tongue burn. The 48% ABV really packs a punch without much sugary sweetness to pad it. Some drying oak tannins and a pervasive nuttiness.Finish Medium length with some of that vanilla returning in the form of crispy wafer cookies and the citrus peel in the form of lemon curd. The finish flirts with the edge of bitterness but resolves instead as lightly wooded and slightly drying.With Water Several drops of water add an herbal note to the nose – white tea? The water does nothing to tame the torrent of alcohol on the palate perhaps even increasing its burn. This doesn’t really need water for flavor enhancement but you might want to consider adding more than a few drops if you want to reduce the burn via dilution.Overall I generally grow bored with malts aged only in ex-bourbon. However while the Founder’s Reserve doesn’t stray far from the mark in terms of character it has a grace and nuance that keep it interesting and a powerful right hook in that 48% ABV – it wakes you right up. This is priced right at $44. A good baseline dram with a little something extra – a rarity these days.
179,Glen Scotia (15 year) - Campbeltown the whiskymaking region on the Mull of Kintyre peninsula is now practically synonymous with the Springbank distillery. For a region that once boasted 30 distilleries to be reduced to three is a shame and is evidence of the ebbs and flows of fortune that the whisky industry is subject to. Really even well-stocked whisky shops these days carry only Springbank Longrow and Hazelburn (which are both also made at Springbank) so it might surprise some newbies to learn that Campbeltown is also home to the Glengyle distillery (Kilkerran) and the Glen Scotia distillery.Early in my whisky journey I remember tasting (but not reviewing) a Glen Scotia 10 or 12 year and being so thoroughly unimpressed that I didn’t even write any notes. Probably at the time I thought “this might be better with some age on it” and passed it by. So finding a sample of Glen Scotia 15 at Master of Malt (which no longer ships to the US curse them) I thought it high time to give this Campbeltown revenant some representation on the blog. Also I’ve rarely had a 15 year-old scotch that didn’t agree with me. What could go wrong?Glen Scotia makes a small amount of heavily-peated malt but most of its products are very lightly peated at around 15 ppm. This 15 year-old is aged in ex-bourbon casks and bottled at 46% ABV without chill filtration (but possibly with added coloring). The Glen Scotia product line was revamped and relaunched in 2015. Click here for a review of the NAS Double Cask expression.Nose Slightly meaty with a dose of beeswax fungal earth and very faint peat (not smoke). Some sulfur but not to the “rotten eggs” degree. There is a note of lemon peel but it is in the background. Not sweet.Palate Thin body. Beeswax again. After a mild tongue burn it becomes nutty (nougat and/or marzipan) and a little bitter (walnut skins). Like the aroma there is a distinct lack of sweetness.Finish Medium-short. Dry a little woody. More charcoal and bitter at that than I like. Fades with only a hint of sweetness in the form of caramel.With Water The addition of a few drops of water brings a little sweetness in the form of ripe banana and vanilla cake frosting. Water is a pleasant addition with this dram.Overall This is not something I would choose over any comparably-priced malt. It is too dry without having complexity to justify the lack of sweetness. There is nothing floral about it and precious little fruit. The 15 years in oak have lent a bit of mature woodiness but also appear to have added a bit too much bitterness and charcoal. The earthy mild peat on the nose is interesting but doesn’t warrant the purchase of a bottle especially not if you can get a good price on Springbank 10.
180,Glen Scotia Campbeltown Malts Festival 2019 - I was alerted to the presence of this particular unicorn by my whisky tasting group and bought it sight unseen. I figured (correctly it turns out) that it would make a nice Christmas dram.Glen Scotia makes a small amount of heavily-peated malt but most of its products are very lightly peated at around 15 ppm. I’ve reviewed the NAS Double Cask and the 15 year-old with middling results. Glen Scotia forms the Campbeltown triad – the last remaining vestiges of a robust whiskymaking region – along with Springbank and now Glengyle (Kilkerran).This limited edition malt was distilled in 2003 in one of Glen Scotia’s heavily-peated batches and bottled in 2019 to celebrate the annual Campbeltown Malts Festival. The 15 year-old malt was finished for 8 months in Guyana demerara rum casks (it was matured in refill ex-bourbon American oak) and bottled without added color or chill-filtration at a cask strength of 51.3% ABV which is fairly low – I wonder if the Campbeltown climate encourages a greater-than-average angels’ share. Original retail listed this above $100 a bottle but it can be found for $70 which is what I paid at K&L in Redwood City CA. They still have some bottles available.Nose Clean crisp peat like freshly-dug loam and green-wood campfire smoke. The peat is in roughly equal proportion to a distinct rum aroma – molasses burnt caramel and toasted walnuts. There’s also banana-nut bread (luckily the banana element is faint and not overly ripe like a lot of banana notes in whisky) light tobacco and meaty dried coconut. The peat is not strong – indeed after nosing for a few minutes it fades into the background which gives an overall impression of “smoked rum” rather than “rum-flavored peat”. After a rest in the glass Glen Scotia’s signature lemon peel note becomes more detectable.Palate Soft silky body. Moderate tongue burn which subsides quickly. Palate has a dose of licorice coconut-flecked rum earthy peat and a woody overtone. A sense of baked goods pervades – like chewy brown sugar bars or rum-raisin pudding. Very tasty.Finish Long. Meaty with tons of cashew nougat date and more. Fades slowly with a slight edge of woody bitterness and a suggestion of charcoal.With Water A few drops of water kick up a slight vegetal note – like rhum agricole – but otherwise doesn’t seem to change the aroma. The palate is thinner and the burn reduced. I would say only add water if you’d like to lower the proof.Overall I’ve had both excellent rum-finished single malts as well as atrocious ones. The bad ones invariably taste like the worst parts of rum overripe bananas and bitter astringency. The excellent ones translate the tropical fruit notes and complex sugar byproducts. In this case the Glen Scotia’s mild Campbeltown peat plays very nicely with the complex sugar notes (molasses burnt caramel etc.) melding earthy smoke with rich baked goods. It does seem to be missing those tropical fruit notes (aside from coconut). Still this is one of the most successful rum-finshed malts that I’ve tried and simultaneously one of the better finished peated malts. Usually I find peat clashes with the cask finish. Not here.I’m giving this a Must Try rating although it will shortly be sold out. This is because of the rarity of a successful rum-finished peated malt. If you like peat and are curious about how the rum will interact with it you’ll very likely enjoy this.There are still some bottles of this release available. I would not pay more than about $80 but I feel $70 is in the sweet spot for value here. I mean it’s a well-made cask-strength rum-finished limited single malt at 15 years of age. $70 is actually cheap in today’s market. I know what I’ll be toasting with at Christmas dinner this year – I bet it will go really well with ham… and even better with leftover ham sandwiches. Mmm. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
181,Glen Scotia Double Cask - OK let me preface this by saying that I have a viscerally negative reaction to seeing Glen Scotia single malt on a menu or in a tasting. I have disliked every Glen Scotia that I have tried and have begun to associate the otherwise-innocent distillery with the entire downfall of Campbeltown whisky. Luckily this blog forces me to have an open mind. There are more expressions to review so I continue tasting despite my prejudices and biases. Some readers have suggested that I temper my disdain for Glen Scotia by trying Double Cask a partially-sherried finished NAS malt in the same vein as The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 but without the age statement. I probably would have forgotten entirely about this suggestion but I fortuitously happened upon a sample in my haul of Master of Malt ‘drinks by the dram’ minis from last year. Apparently Past Me figured that I needed to review it.Glen Scotia one of the two remaining Campbeltown distilleries is known for a house character that involves mild peat (like the lesser-peated Springbanks) an oily mouthfeel and some variant of lemon peel notes. It’s hard to have a conversation about Glen Scotia without someone redirecting the topic to Springbank which everyone just sort of agrees is better in every way. See? I just did it. I bet Glen Scotia people hate that.Double Cask is a NAS vatting of Glen Scotia single malt aged in first-fill ex-bourbon casks and is finished for “up to a year” in Pedro Ximénez (PX) sherry casks. Let me stop a moment to ask… why on earth do marketers use phrases like “up to a year”? I mean… zero seconds is included under the umbrella of “up to a year”. Gah.Nose Tropical fruits up the wazoo. (What the heck is a wazoo? Oh.) Kiwi fresh green banana white tea raspberries white peach and a delicate floral note like honeysuckle or jasmine. A rest in the glass makes this even better with an undercurrent of caramel syrup and peanut butter to contrast the fruits.Palate Medium body not quite syrupy. Oaky up front with lots of vanilla and a hearty dose of cinnamon. A strident tongue burn (surprising for 46%) is accompanied by a few dried fruits (apricot date) a mouth-drying dollop of tannins and a peanut buttery maltiness that reminds me of some porters.Finish Short. An herbal quality something in between black tea and herb cough drops dominates the finish. There is no bitterness but also not much evolution. Subsequent sips have more oak and sugar in them which brings the finish back into balance.With Water A few drops of water add a little more of that caramel (and some vanilla) to the aroma. The flavor seems a little brighter with more nuttiness as does the finish. Try both without and then with a little water.Overall Holy frijoles this is miles better than the (older) 15 year-old expression which I almost-but-don’t-quite hate. The aroma is heavenly the liquid on the tongue is well-balanced and emphatic and the finish is complex. It’s bottled at the appropriate 46% ABV as well. Too bad there’s no age statement.Turns out that Glen Scotia really just needed some sherry to shine. (Update or some rum!)At $45 this is up there with the likes of The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 and GlenDronach 12 in my personal estimation and warrants a rare “Must Have” rating.
182,GlenAllachie (12 year) - Man GlenAllachie has absolutely burst onto the scene lately. Like many Scottish distilleries it was built in 1967 mainly to provide malt whisky for blending. It exchanged hands several times during the dark ages of the scotch industry’s “whisky loch” and spent many years mothballed. I hadn’t even heard about the distillery until 2020. In a story that’s eerily similar to Bruichladdich’s the neglected facility was bought in 2017 by a plucky group of private investors who have since turned the brand into an international powerhouse apparently purely through the power of marketing. The new owners released a new range of age-stated whiskies with new labels in 2018. This range is entirely 46% ABV (or higher) not chill-filtered and has no added coloring.GlenAllachie previously used mainly ex-bourbon barrels to age its blending stock but there were enough barrels laid down in sherry casks to provide some variety to the stocks that master distiller Billy Walker uses to create the range. There are also a number of cask finishes in the portfolio which makes me think the first thing the new owners did was re-rack a bunch of casks into port rum Pedro Ximenez sherry etc. to have more choices for bottling. The distillery does use some peated malt purportedly about 20% of their production is peated. None of the current retail releases include this malt though so we’ll have to wait a bit longer to see what peated GlenAllachie is like.Official information is a little scarce but online sources claim the 12 year is aged in a combination of virgin oak PX sherry casks and oloroso sherry casks. I couldn’t tell if those are full-term sherry or if they are finishes or what kind of virgin oak that is (American? European? Was a swallow involved?) or if there was ex-bourbon in the mix that they aren’t mentioning. So I reached out to my contacts (that is to say I begged the only industry contact I have for information) and learned that there is indeed 1st- and 2nd-fill ex-bourbon involved. The virgin oak is American white oak and those are re-racked (finished) not fully-matured. The vatting uses both fully-matured and re-racked sherry casks (both PX and oloroso). This clear up most of my questions obviously GlenAllachie didn’t have a bunch of full-term virgin oak casks sitting around when the new owners took over. The label information is scarce and vague because like a lot of official brand bottlings the master distiller uses a variety of casks to achieve a consistent house character. Still it burns me a little that the readily-available retail materials don’t mention ex-bourbon but do mention the virgin oak. That makes this much closer category-wise to The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 than something 100% sherry like GlenDronach 12.Like the rest of the lineup it is bottled at 46% ABV without added color or chill filtration.Nose Initially shy this requires a little rest in the glass to open up. When it does there’s a piercingly fruity fresh sweet red wine note. Hidden below that are notes of chewy caramel pear drops dark chocolate and buttery shortbread or maybe graham cracker. There’s more complexity below – as it rests in the glass it slowly reveals more. Give it time.Palate Pleasantly thick body almost syrupy. A strong dark chocolate fudge note kicks off the party followed by a mild tongue burn. After it clears there’s some slightly bitter charcoal buttery oak and just a smear of grape jam.Finish Medium-long. The chocolate remains and turns bittersweet like dry cocoa. Some of the other bitter elements creep back in but remain balanced. Fades without evolution.With Water A few drops of water increase the nose tickle necessitating another rest in the glass. Some of the jam comes forward and the bright red fruits are reawakened. The palate seems thinner but sweeter. If your dram becomes a little boring add some water to wake it up but definitely try it without water first.Overall I can’t remember ever having a malt that tastes so much like chocolate. I expected some sherry elements from the aroma but the fruit is decidedly in the background while the chocolate notes – bitter and sweet alike – take center stage. Certainly there are no off-notes making this a very accomplished dram. The price seems right as it’s an upgrade from your standard 12 year-old Speysider. I can’t decide if it quite reaches the heights of GlenDronach 12 (which is still a little cheaper) but it’s no doubt an evenly-matched fight and worth of your attention.
183,Glencadam (10 year) - Glencadam is one of those malts that you’ve never heard of but may well have tasted. Its unusual creaminess and light floral character make it valuable in blending. The majority of output from the distillery has traditionally been a component in Stewart’s Cream of the Barley blend and also appears in Ballantine’s and a few other products. Only recently after acquisition by Angus Dundee plc has the range of Glencadam single malts been expanded. Prior to 2003 only a 15-year official bottling was available. Now a 10 year makes this malt more accessible and a 21 and two cask-finished expressions (a portwood and an oloroso sherry-finished) round out the profile. The region of the southern Highlands (along the eastern coast) once flourished with malt distillation but after many closures in the 1970s and 1980s (such as Lochside and Glenesk) Glencadam remains.The distillery’s source water is piped 30 miles from Loch Lee and is reportedly “very” soft. Perhaps this soft water contributes to the creamy body and light floral shy nature of the whisky. Happily for whisky lovers Glencadam is bottled at 46% ABV with no chill filtration nor added coloring. The 10 year-old is exclusively aged in ex-bourbon barrels (probably refill judging by the pale color).Nose Play-dough or raw yeasty bread dough. Faint vanilla. Grassy. White tea. Even after some time to open up it’s very light and shy.Palate Excellent creamy body like a single-grain whisky. A bit sharp on the tongue burn for a 46%. Resolves with marshmallow raw pecans and fresh sweet whipping cream. Light in character.Finish Tasty with a soupy mix of vanilla bean creme brulee and vague nuttiness. Fades with an awesomely strong note of roasted chestnuts. Not at all bitter but on the short side.With Water A few drops of water opens a little orange-blossom honey on the nose and adds some kind of citrus to the palate. Seems otherwise not to affect the whisky. A few drops doesn’t hurt but I wouldn’t try to add more for fear of washing out the already subtle flavors.Overall An interesting one. It has almost no presence in the nose but shows really nice body on the tongue. It isn’t until the finish that the flavors really come to life. Seems odd to skip the smelling and tasting stages to get to the good stuff but there it is. I wouldn’t rush out and buy a bottle of this but it’s worth a shot if you see it on a bar menu but drink it first in the lineup – I doubt it would stand up well next to other more robust drams. I would guess that the extra five years in barrel would give the 15-year official bottling the assertiveness and complexity that is missing here.Note The 15 is available in the US but it may be difficult (or impossible?) to find the other expressions.
184,Glencadam (13 year) “The Re-Awakening” - I previously enjoyed the very subtle Glencadam 10-year a distillery official bottling that became available after the distillery was purchased and re-opened by Angus Dundee Distillers in 2003. Now the new ownership is celebrating the “re-awakening” of the distillery by releasing this 13 year-old limited edition run of 6000 bottles 3000 for the US market. This is comprised of whisky run from the stills in 2003 after the distillery sale following a brief 3-year period of non-operation. The whisky is aged in ex-bourbon casks and is bottled with “craft presentation” 46% ABV with no added coloring and no chill-filtration.The whisky is a very pale straw color.Nose Soft round notes of nougat and marshmallow marzipan and buttered scones (ok ok any buttered bakery item). Subtle and simple but with depth of aroma and no rough edges.Palate Full-bodied almost syrupy. Nougat upfront with a moderate to heavy tongue burn. Chewy with elements of burnt caramel nut butters and dried coconut. Pleasant lightly sweet and mild.Finish Medium length. Toasted brioche. Bittersweet chocolate fades to light oak toasted walnuts and vanilla taffy.With Water The addition of a few drops of water seems to mute the nose but amplifies a clear hazelnut flavor on the palate. Water optional here.Overall An accomplished polished and tasty expression of Glencadam showing the distillery’s strengths. Although they have depth the flavors and aromas here are subtle and well-integrated meaning they require careful contemplation and should not be approached with an expectation of boldness or brashness like one would with a peated or heavily-sherried malt. The ex-bourbon cask influence is clear but understated complementing but not dominating the soft grain and nutty-sweet malt. Its only real flaw is a hotter-than-expected tongue burn a nitpick.The suggested retail price is $65 which isn’t bad for a “limited edition” new release these days. Still we’re talking about a 13 year-old ex-bourbon single malt from a lesser-known distillery which is something I would expect to see in the $40 or maybe $50 range. Despite that I thoroughly enjoyed my sample and would consider purchasing a bottle if I needed to fill an ex-bourbon single malt niche in my cabinet. If I saw it for sale under $50 I would snatch it up. If you can’t find it the official distillery 15-year bottling is available for ehhemm… even more money.
185,Glencadam (15 year) - I previously reviewed the 10-year which I found middling and the 13-year which I liked despite the price.Glencadam has been rising in international awareness since its rejuvenation by new owner Angus Dundee in 2003. The 15-year was named Whisky of the Year by Ralfy in 2017 which subjected an already very-limited supply to the ravages of the Internet-enabled whisky-loving populace. Prices spiked in the US above $100 and everyone promptly sold out. It’s worth noting that because the distillery was mothballed for a few years prior to its 2003 reopening there just aren’t any barrels of 15-year sitting around yet which explains the supply crunch. Expect to see more bottles on shelves when the reopening juice hits the 15-year mark sometime in 2019. Hopefully this will coincide with a return to previous prices.If you cannot wait some UK retailers still have it at the very-reasonable price of (without VAT) $65 per 700ml bottle.Glencadam’s 15 year-old expression like most of its releases is aged exclusively in ex-bourbon casks to retain the distillery character. The whisky is not chill-filtered and has no added coloring and is bottled (now) at 46% ABV.Nose Perfumed and very floral. Rosewater lilac orange blossom honeysuckle. Next a wave of green banana lime salt-water taffy and kiwi. Exceedingly delicate and all of the individual notes are ephemeral and fleeting. Underneath the perfume notes is a very thin foundation very pale malt mineral water and banana leaves.Palate Medium body not quite syrupy. A moderate tongue burn is followed by densely sweet honey fondant and buttercream frosting. Rosewater again with pistachio and nougat. Despite all the sugary notes it is not cloying.Finish Medium-short. Still sweet with a reprise of some of the floral notes from the palate (nice to see those come full-circle). Fades slowly with pear pastilles bubblegum and no bitterness at all.With Water A few drops of water bring an odd ferny vegetal note to the aroma which chases away all of the flowers which don’t really come back even with a rest in the glass. The palate seems thinner and actually less sweet with an added tart note of lime. Water is not really needed here at 46% I think it’s proofed correctly.Overall A delicate dram with a host of mostly floral notes to explore. The palate far from being delicate is like smooshing your face into a wedding cake. There are no off-notes although everything seems tied together with spun sugar without a whole lot of substance underneath. It’s a tasty if unsatisfying meal of a dram although I hesitate to recommend any 15 year-old single malt that rises to the triple digits in price. If you can find it for $60 I think that’s about where it should reside. I suggest waiting until late 2019 when the supply returns to normal.
186,Glendalough 7 Year Single Malt Irish Whiskey - The Glendalough (which means valley with two lakes) distillery opened in 2011 with an eye to making traditional Irish spirits in a craft style. Located in County Wicklow Ireland the distillery makes an array of spirits including gin and traditional Irish Poitín (moonshine). They also sell a column-distilled grain whiskey (called Double Barrel) and a pair of pot-distilled single malts. The malts are currently available at 7 and 13 years of age with different finishes. Of course since the distillery is relatively new these are sourced whiskies from Cooley until the distillery’s pot-distilled whiskies reach bottling age. This 7 year-old single malt is aged for 6-7 years in ex-bourbon American oak and then finished in Irish porter casks from 5 Lamps Brewery in Dublin. The malt is bottled at 46% ABV without chill filtration.Beer-finished whiskey is not a new idea but it’s certainly not common. If this trend catches on prepare yourself for wine-finished cognac cider-finished calvados and molasses barrel-finished rum. Look at that… I made a joke!Nose Fruit-forward and bright. Piercing tropical fruits (primarily kiwi) and white peach. Green tea something floral (jasmine or honeysuckle maybe) green apple and a very light malty sweetness. Very appealing.Palate Medium-bodied. Huge amount of coconut up front both dried and fresh with an edge of milk chocolate. Black pepper light malt and graham cracker appear after a brief and mild tongue burn.Finish Short. A little tannic. Walnut meats oak and a fading hint of brown sugar or molasses.With Water A few drops of water sweetens up the aroma but replaces fresh fruit notes with processed candy ones. It also adds a touch of nougat or caramel. The palate actually feels a little hotter and there are no extra flavors. I would skip the water here it’s not needed and it messes with a delicate balance.Overall A very tasty malt and has none of the off-flavors associated with most young malts. It has the brightness and tartness of youth but without any paint thinner or glue notes. Those fruit notes remind me strongly of the better Teeling whiskies (as they should they’re likely both from Cooley) but at a much easier price point than those due to the young age. The porter finish is definitely in the background and downright seamless. Well done. If this was cheaper I’d call it a Must Try. For what it’s worth after I wrote this review I ordered a full bottle online which is a rarity for me.
187,GlenDronach (12 year) “Original” - GlenDronach is a classically sherried whisky. The meaty sturdy spirit distilled near the Dronach Burn in Speyside is naturally suited to long aging in ex-sherry casks. Most of the products on the shelf are bottled from the stocks of maturing whisky distilled by the previous owners. Now that the Benriach Distilling Company owns it (since 2008) we can expect to begin seeing offerings from this distillery that both enforce the “sherry monster” reputation as well as explorations into new avenues of expression. For example a 21-year and soon a 15-year bottling finished in tawny port casks. Looking forward to trying those!The 12 year-old “Original” product re-launched in 2009 is entirely aged in ex-sherry casks some Pedro Ximinez and some Oloroso. It is non-chill-filtered no coloring added and bottled at 43% ABV. The more I drink good whisky the more I appreciate seeing those declarations on labels.Nose Meaty sherried nose with lots of dark red plum chewing tobacco and a savory quality – like glazed short ribs. Lots going on under the surface – thankfully not too sweet nor too fruity. Just right in fact. After developing in the glass there’s a little Maraschino cherry and maybe some wood varnish.Palate Medium-bodied and mellow. Initially there is a rush of cherry and a rye-like spiciness which subside into barbecue sauce dried plums coconut butter and dark chocolate shavings.Finish Not long but tasty. The lingering effect of the wood tannin dries the mouth while a burnt sugar taste like cola persists but isn’t bitter. After awhile the malt finally shines through with a marshmallowy powdered-sugar-covered cereal flavor. Good stuff.A few drops of water seem not to affect the nose palate or finish. Odd that. I suggest leaving out the water although it might sweeten things a tad if that’s how you prefer it.Overall For $45 this is an exceptionally good sherried malt. Worlds better (I think) than The Macallan 12 at a similar price point. It has a continuous balanced savoriness that works perfectly with the sweet fruit elements inherent in sherry maturation – like a good spicy/sweet glaze on barbecued pork. Yum. If you have a spot in your daily dram rotation for an inexpensive sherried malt get this one.
188,GlenDronach (14 year) Sauternes Finish - Occasionally I get to treat myself. While ordering a batch of miniatures from Master of Malt for the drudgery of writing these blog posts (just kidding) I splurged and also ordered a bottle of the 14 year-old Sauternes-finished GlenDronach from their line of non-sherry barrel finishes. I’m a sucker for a Sauternes finish and GlenDronach is fast becoming one of my top five distilleries so this European-only release (a 700ml bottle) was a no-brainer.This release was aged for an un-announced amount of time (I’m guessing between 12 and 13 years) in a “European oak” cask according to the tin. This was then followed by a second maturation in a Sauternes cask until the age of 14. It is bottled at 46% ABV without coloring or chill-filtration (music to my ears). I am uncertain of the provenance of the “European” oak casks used in the initial aging. It must be a batch of totally spent refill ex-sherry casks as I do not get any of the spicy notes associated with French Oak nor any sherry influence at all. Tasting blind I would have guessed ex-bourbon because of the vanilla.Nose Sticky-sweet with plump golden raisins and crystallized honey and a mild sour winey note. Peach syrup and dried apricots over vanilla-banana pudding. Cake frosting. Flawless nose – deep and inviting but very (very) sweet.Palate Medium-bodied – slightly chewy which is the only hint this is GlenDronach at its core. Pear drops golden raisins apricot Turkish Delight. Sweet. Almost – but not quite – cloyingly so.Finish Medium-short. First the mouth is enrobed in a candy-apple coating. This is stripped away by a flash of acidic freshly-squeezed white grape juice which lingers while a hint of bitter sappy oak creeps in. It fades away with green grape skins. With Water Water opens up a few cereal notes but dulls some of the complexity in the nose. The water has a nice congealing effect on the palate – lessening the syrup and heightening the golden raisins and fresh grapes. Ditto on the finish. Definitely try this with water – but try it without first.Overall The experience is very similar to a syrup I made once by re-hydrating golden raisins in white port. Yum. This is dessert whisky and no bones about it. While the GlenDronach house style (meaty/oily) is missing here – likely because the house style is closely associated with the sherry character of the flagship expressions – this is still one robust flavor-filled escapade of a whisky. Sweet to the point of cloying but excellently balanced by a grapey acidity and fruity complexity. Truly a pleasure especially for a lover of dessert wines. I am not disappointed in my purchase from across the pond.
189,GlenDronach (15 year) Revival - It’s actually been awhile since I tasted something new that made me think “Oh God yes! That’s why I love scotch.” It should be no surprise to me or anyone that a GlenDronach would do the honors. GlenDronach’s 15 year-old “Revival” (named for the revitalization of the distillery after current owner The BenRiach Distillery Company acquired it in 2008) is aged for the full 15 years in Oloroso sherry casks. But being GlenDronach it acquires more than just a “fruit bomb” or “fruit punch” sherry character from this treatment It becomes concentrated and resiny and savory as well as fruity. That’s what I loved about the distillery’s 12 year “Original” and here somehow the extra 3 years (and the use of only Oloroso not PX sherry) really makes a big difference. As usual with GlenDronach – and another reason to love them – the whisky is bottled at 46% ABV is not chill-filtered and has no added coloring agents. The color is beautiful too – a dark rusty amber bronze.Nose Sawdust and wood sap. Then sticky molasses port wine reduction and fig jam. The fruit here is dark dense and resinous and the malt serves only as a platform for the intensely concentrated sherry notes. Accompanying the fruit notes is an unctuous meaty greasy component that is the hallmark of GlenDronach’s house style – something like a cross between Teriyaki beef jerky sun-dried tomatoes and axle grease. But in a good way. A long rest in the glass reveals – as it often does with single-malt an aromatic vanilla note.Palate Thin body but oh how fruity. Assorted jams raisins prunes and fig all served up on a platter of well-aged malt. The savory/greasy character shows through quickly and keeps the Teriyaki theme going.Finish At last the fruit freshens up and becomes cherry lozenge young red wine grape soda and a background of ripe fig. A mild sense of Red Vines (“red” licorice) is followed by a slight woodiness – no bitterness! – and a lingering meatiness. Beef jerky again.Interesting diversion There’s no real consensus on the flavor of Red Vines which were originally raspberry flavored but were re-formulated in 1953 and dropped the raspberry descriptor. Interestingly a blog post comparing the merits of Twizzlers versus Red Vines has about 3 times more comments than my most-active review. Who’s over-thinking things now?With Water A few drops of water reveals some vanilla extract and a mild floral character which is somewhat at odds with the sherry notes. Odd I would have expected it to awaken fresh fruit aromas. The water does emphasize those fresh fruits on the tongue though particularly the cherry. It does the same on the finish. Cherry again. I wouldn’t bother with the water here as it masks some of those sticky resin notes.Overall Like the 12 year this is fruity and savory at the same time. However where the 12 year has many fresh fruit flavors in three more years the 15 has quickly become more concentrated and resinous. There is an umami component that is more apparent than in the 12 year like soy sauce without the salt and it pairs beautifully with the dried fruit and sticky prune character. Chinese plum sauce might be a good way to sum up the flavor profile. To me this shows what sherry aging is capable of doing to a malt and goes way beyond simply being ‘sweet’. Like The Macallan 18 the flavors here are surprising and deep and somehow just taste old. My only complaint is that the malt plays a distant supporting role and is nearly undetectable underneath all that sherry. More integration would have made this even greater.If you like sherry-aged whisky and especially if you aren’t looking for the simpler “fruit punch” effect this is well worth exploration although I recommend trying the 12 year first to get a good feel for what the distillery can do. GlenDronach 15 runs north of $76 – sometimes over $100 – and thus qualifies as a “special occasion” malt but I think the flavor profile matches the price.
190,GlenDronach (18 year) Allardice - I had a peculiar experience a number of years ago related to this whisky. I had splurged and ordered a bottle online to pick up at K&L Wines in Redwood City CA. When I went to pick up my (embarrassingly large) order I saw David Driscoll working and pestered him with some questions while pretending to be a nonchalant customer just swinging by. He hauled my order out of the back room on a freakin’ dolly (see prior embarrassment) and noticed the “Allardice” 18 on my order sheet. Knowing something about my tastes and being excellent at his job he immediately said “you probably aren’t going to like this for the price” and processed a return for me. I think I picked up the GlenDronach 15 Revival instead which is about half the price and which I enjoyed. For anyone who has ever slagged David about his salesmanship and marketing in the past I want you to think about that for a moment. I kept wondering about that bottle though. What about the 18 did he think I wouldn’t like? At the time I considered 18-year expressions to be straight-up upgrades over their 12-15 year siblings with an extra price premium on top. Such is the case for Macallan 18 Glenlivet 18 Glenmorangie 18 and so on.The GlenDronach 18-year is named after the 1826 founder of the distillery James Allardes. It is aged for 18 years exclusively in Spanish oloroso sherry casks and bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring.Finally a half decade later I got around to tasting a sample of that GlenDronach 18 and I now know what David was talking about. This is nothing like the GlenDronach 12 or 15 year bottlings. I’d even hesitate to call it an upgrade even with a whopping $150 price tag.Nose Heavily resinous with a dense balsamic vinegar note and oily compost-y earthy sherry. Definitely GlenDronach (not at all like say Macallan) with more savory raisiny character and less sweet fruit. Loads of sticky dry fruit fruitcake date and an almost black truffle-like fungal aspect. Intense.Palate Thin body. Prune up front with more sherry resin tobacco (shisha) and raw apple cider vinegar. Dry really without much of the sugar one would associate with sherry bombs. Raisiny in the extreme.Finish Deep dark fungal depths of resinous sherry. There’s a lot in there to plumb. Fades with a little mint and berry and some mouth-drying barrel tannin. No bitterness.With Water A few drops of water add a ton of vanilla and a port wine-like sweetness. It also evens-out the palate providing a little more fresh fruit to offset the prunes. Water is an excellent idea here.Overall Huh. This has more deep dark concentrated dry fruit than I’ve ever experienced in a single malt. I’m not sure that’s actually a good thing. It’s quite dry without any of the sugar one would expect in a “fruity” sherried malt. That sherry also covers up any malt characteristics. I wouldn’t call it particularly well-balanced but it is well-made and provides the kind of unctuous quality one expects in an 18-year. A few drops of water also makes up for this malt’s inefficiencies. Still for around $150 I expect a little more.What David did for me so many years ago I’m going to do for you Recommend that you try this somewhere before buying it. For what it’s worth the 21 year is much much better (and much more expensive)…
191,GlenDronach (21 year) Parliament - I have been saving this tiny little sample bottle. What better time than the week before Christmas – before everything gets crazy? GlenDronach is among my favorite distilleries and may make my favorite sherried malt (for the price). The 18 was a mixed bag for me but it is not every day that I get to taste a malt with over 20 years of maturation let alone an official bottling.GlenDronach’s 21 year-old bottling from the official distillery lineup is aged in a combination of PX (Pedro Ximenez) and oloroso sherry casks. (Note that is “aged” not “finished” – this whisky sat for a full 21 years in barrels previously containing sherry.) Hilariously enough in the current political climate this whisky is not in fact named after the British Parliament but rather for the “parliament” of rooks that nest in the trees overlooking the distillery. It is bottled at 48% ABV and without chill filtration or added coloring.Normally I do not review whiskies over $150… in fact I have actually turned away offers of samples for whiskies over that range because I don’t feel right recommending expensive whisky. Like… of course it’s good but I can’t ever say in good conscience that anything that expensive is worth the outrageous sums asked.This though. This isn’t for you dear reader. This is for me.Nose Chocolate-covered cherries melting over double fudge chocolate cake. Decadent. Dense. Port wine reduction drizzled over ripe strawberries nestled into butterscotch pudding. This smells like I imagined the Everlasting Gobstobber tasted when I was a kid. I could smell this forever.Palate Full syrupy body. Restrained tongue burn considering its ABV. Rivers of molten dark chocolate greet the tongue studded with plump figs and dried apricots. Oaky in a controlled precise way perfectly supporting the layers of fruit and sweet. In a word perfect.Finish Medium-long. How did they cram all of this dark chocolate flavor in here? It continues through the finish now with bursting pomegranate arils liquid caramel and fudge. Begins to fade with mint chocolate chips and fresh whole cloves.With Water I almost couldn’t bring myself to do it but after adding 6 drops of water to the (probably) 10ml left in my glass I can smell elevated levels of tart cherry without a lessening of the other notes. The palate might be a little silkier in texture but strangely less coherent. The finish picks up a note of tobacco and fresh undyed leather. This really doesn’t need the intervention of water but you can play with some if you feel the desire.Overall If you couldn’t tell from the over-the-top language in the above notes this is an incredible whisky. One of the best literally that I have ever had. It strikes all of the bells for me Sweet and fruity sherry without being overly resinous or sulfurous. Decadently full flavor without excessive alcohol burn. Mountains of chocolate to degrees I’ve never experienced in a whisky. It starts confidently strides across the palate without faltering and finishes with elegance retaining its integrity. A whole full round complete whisky.Before anyone asks yes this is much better than Macallan 18.I’m going to put a tongue-in-cheek “Must Have” mark on this because honestly if someone said to me “I can afford it. Will I like it?” The answer is a resounding unmitigated YES. How can I mark that any lower? However I cannot honestly say that it’s worth $200 if you don’t have $200 to blow on good whisky. Buy a GlenDronach 12 instead and imagine the chocolate and you’ll be just fine.
192,GlenDronach (8 year) The Hielan’ - Regular readers will know that I’m a GlenDronach fanboy. For proof just look at me fawning over the 21 year-old Parliament a whisky I will never be wealthy enough to buy by the bottle. Luckily GlenDronach 12 year is still good and still affordable. Once in awhile though a fanboy likes to branch out and experience those B-sides and concert bootlegs to experience his or her favorite from a wider range of perspectives. Expand the horizon if you will experience things more fully. Unfortunately there’s something about hearing grainy unmastered versions of your favorite songs where the artist clearly sounds out of breath and the drummer is probably hungover. For me anyway it kills the illusion of mastery. Now that I’ve wrung every bit of value out of that tortured metaphor we’ll continue to the whisky.GlenDronach The Hielan’ is an 8 year-old ‘Dronach that only seems to retail in the UK. The whisky comes from a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks which makes me think it’s an attempt to compete with a number of “double cask” expressions proliferating on the market such as The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year. It seems odd to me to compete with a popular $40 whisky by releasing a $40 whisky that is 4 years younger but nobody asked me. At least it has an age statement.Nose Spirity with buttered rum cake green apple and very faint chocolate. A brief rest in the glass reveals a layer of sulfurous banana (the overripe variety).Palate Thin body. Aggressive tongue burn. Hazelnuts black licorice and some assorted dried fruits.Finish On the short side. Finally some real fruit with sherry-derived raisins dates and dried apple. Fades quickly without much evolution.With Water The addition of a few drops of water brings nothing new to the party either to the aroma or the tongue. I could take or leave water with this one.Overall Frankly there is a reason that most good single malt is aged in excess of a decade just like most good music is made with care time and money in the studio. It matters. This is not markedly better than blended scotches or NAS malts that are priced lower and the only value to the admirer of GlenDronach is to highlight how vital those extra 4 years of sherry maturation are to this distillery’s output. The aroma is too spirity and the fruit notes are sparse. The tongue burn is too hot although the flavors are nice. The finish is too short. The addition of some ex-bourbon barrels to the vat robs the expression of GlenDronach’s house character. It’s not a bad dram certainly but it’s not even remotely close to the quality of GlenDronach 12-year which is only a few bucks more. No contest.
193,GlenDronach 1994 K&L Exclusive - I really like GlenDronach. It has since my review of GlenDronach 12-year become hands-down my favorite all-sherry Speysider. I haven’t yet tried a Macallan that I like better than its respective (equivalently-priced) GlenDronach. I recently had the pleasure of tasting a single-cask GlenDronach from 1994 bottled exclusively for K&L Wines & Spirits whom I’ve championed many times before. They certainly know their cask selection.This stuff at around 16 years old is very pricey. K&L usually has fantastic prices but it’s hard to put a comparison on something like this that you can’t get anywhere else especially when it’s from a single barrel. That said I do balk at paying in excess of $110 for a scotch at 16 years even if it is damn tasty.The standard 12 year is aged in a combination of sherry casks. This one is from a Pedro Ximinez cask which some consider to be superior. Non-chill-filtered no coloring added and bottled at a cask strength of 56% ABV. This is a bit less dramatically fiery than the low-60%s you find on some younger cask-strength bottlings but the balance here is so fine that you don’t even notice that it’s 112 proof.Nose Meaty as all GlenDronachs are. My first thought is Marsala – oxidized red wine notes abound with an undertone of sumptuous vanilla creme. There is a top note that seems a little off – perhaps verging on sulphur. It does not throw off the experience though and might have been my imagination. Regardless there is extreme depth in the nose here with lots of dark dried red fruit. Complex doesn’t describe the half of it.Palate Concentrated and intense. Some nice bright red fruit merges with the dark sticky dried fruit to give a perfect balance to the almost salty (jerky-like) meatiness of the spirit. Like the GlenDronach 12 but with a lot more power and a lot more depth.Finish Very long for an unpeated malt. Longer I think than the 12 year. Some ginger creeps in and echoes of cranberry and fig.A few drops of water open up the nose yielding a cascade of dried cherries and a few hints of banana that weren’t present before. It also seems to eliminate that sulphur note I detected although that could also have just been from a few extra minutes in the glass. The water also adds a little sweetness on the palate perhaps at the expense of some of that mysterious complexity.Overall At $116 for 750ml I can’t say I recommend that everyone run out and buy this. However if you’re looking for a splurge and love complex meaty sherried Speysiders this one is hard to beat. For the money I’d even suggest that it is more satisfying than The Macallan 18 which is far more expensive.
194,Glenfarclas (12 year) - I always like to support independent distilleries that produce reliable quality malt year after year. Glenfarclas is among that dwindling group. However I also like to spend under $45 for my entry-level scotches. While the price of the 17 (review here) can be justified by its maturity and by comparison with the price tags of some competitor 18 year malts the 12 is (in my opinion) not quite good enough to command a $50 price point. A little extra wood character (maybe at 14 or 15 years) or a deeper sherry influence via the use of some first-fill casks (or a sweeter sherry) might elevate it to compete with other malts in the midlevel category. As it is though Glenfarclas is a malt that benefits from long aging (as evidenced by their deep stocks of 30 40 and even 50 year-old juice) and comes off slightly thin and insubstantial without that time in barrel.I would say that this is a malt you should grab up if you see it on sale in the $40-$45 range but otherwise should only fill the void if you’re in need of mildly sherried Speysiders without much heft.Glenfarclas markets itself as a Highland malt eschewing the coveted Speyside origin designation. However most texts categorize it with its brethren in the valley of the Spey due to its location.Nose Lemony and light orange notes. Nice malt balance. Deep but not very complex. Very mild sherry influence. A rest in glass reveals deeper sweetness and a slight nuttiness or nougat.Palate More citrus in a light crisp refreshing way. A bit thin.Finish Nice if somewhat short. Raspberry coulis and the barest shavings of fresh oak wood. Ends elegantly without bitterness.Overall Good for a 12 year but not a whole lot of sherry character. Would be great value at $40 but it suffers from a case of overpricing of entry level malt Not substantially better than other sherried 12 year-olds but priced at the psychologically detrimental $50 mark. Look for this one on sale or splurge on the older malts in the line.
195,Glenfarclas (15 year) - I like Glenfarclas. It’s an independent distillery still family-owned despite massive conglomeration in the rest of the scotch industry and pretty much just continues doing what it’s always done make solid dependable whisky at an acceptable price. Other than the vintage-dated Family Casks and the value-priced NAS 105 Glenfarclas doesn’t release flashy bottlings every year with high pricetags and no age statements. It doesn’t name whisky after trips to space or antarctic digs. It’s also the last distillery in Scotland to use exclusively direct-fired stills. There’s value in doing things the old way and in not following trends like whiskymaking sheep. There you go that’s your tagline The folks at Glenfarclas are not just whiskymaking sheep.I’m a fan of the Glenfarclas 17 a well-priced competitor to other sherried malt in the 18 year range although I thought the 12 year was priced a little high. Alas the 15 is apparently (please correct me if I’m wrong) not sold in the US because Goldilocks (were she a malt drinker) would have settled on this one. It’s just right.Nose Pungent grapey resin alongside prunes dried red apples and other jammy dried fruits. A tart top-note like red wine vinegar but not as acidic comes and goes while the overall impression slides towards jam and those bright red candied apples at the fair. Deeper in there is an oily citrus note like orange bitters. A rest in the glass reveals some vanilla.Palate Medium body with a very tame tongue burn. Again the flavors center around dried fruits jams and apple. Near the end there’s also a black licorice element.Finish Of medium length. Blackberry jam drying red wine tannins (like the dregs at the bottom of a big fruit-forward red). Fades quickly without much residue.With Water A few drops of water actually seem to collapse the aroma muting all of the fruit and adding nothing. If you add water make sure to give it a lengthy rest before sampling. The palate becomes maltier with more of a graham cracker note but (again) with less fruit. Just skip the water here.Overall A mid-line sherried malt without the “big fruit” hallmarks of a true sherry monster but with plenty of berry wine and resin to produce the desired effect. The fruits are subdued but do contain that aged balsamic resinous quality and are balanced by slight malty sweetness. This is the kind of drink you reach for when you want to lean back and relax on a chilly winter evening but not necessarily think too hard about what’s in your glass. As it’s not sold in the US my American readers might consider this one the next time a friend or family member is traveling to Europe. You know as a souvenir.
196,Glenfarclas (17 year) - I had the pleasure of meeting George Grant of the Glenfarclas family at a K&L Tasting on Tuesday. Very friendly chap even when I asked him if he was related to the Grants of Glenfiddich (William Grant & Sons company). Yes he said if you go back some 200 years he’s related to them… but he mentioned that the William Grant & Sons company has been controlled by the Gordon family after William Grant left the company to his son-in-law Charles Gordon in 1923.Glenfarclas is one of the few independent family-owned distilleries left in Scotland. Oh to be the heir of a family with some tens of thousands of barrels of quietly aging sherry-matured scotch to its name! Let’s hope they keep their heads above water and the dollar signs out of their eyes lest we see another independent bite the dust.Big stills (the biggest in Speyside) which are direct-fired (not heated with steam) contribute to the interesting duality of Glenfarclas whisky it is at once weighty and light – deep but crisp – and although it is aged almost exclusively in first-fill ex-sherry barrels it does not become syrupy or heavy with fruit. I had a sip of the 40 year-old a few weeks ago and while it tasted old it did not taste thick over-sherried or unpleasantly woody. Of course one must pay for high-quality whisky produced with an independent spirit. The 17 year-old is $90.Nose Toffee. Marshmallow. Smooth – very elegant and refined. Bit of orange peel oil.Palate More orange. Medium sherry character. Delivers on the promises made by the nose. Pleasant and easy to sip.Finish Oh yeah. Supple. Orange peel with a lightly herbal sherry character that is more reminiscent of crisp white cherries than heavy dried prunes. No bitterness at all and while the finish is only of medium length it resounds to the end with crisp citrusy sherry and lightly caramelly malt.Overall Yum. Very enjoyable. Of course it’s $90 so… not exactly great value but if you compare it to some of the $100+ 18 year-olds on the market it stands up well.
197,Glenfarclas 105 Cask Strength - Glenfarclas has been known in whisky circles as a way to get old-fashioned independently-distilled sherry-forward single malt at insider prices. I remember at the beginning of my whisky adventure the NAS-when-NAS-was-cool 105 was on the lips of many a contemporary blogger and professional reviewer for its cask-strength bottling proof its sherry bomb trendiness and its reasonable price. Those days are over. I can’t find a bottle of 105 for cheaper than $80 in the US.The ‘105’ in the name refers to the proof which in the British proof system is 60% ABV. Around here we use the US proof system which means the 105 is actually 120. Got it? It’s worth noting that being exactly 60% ABV and also “cask strength” is a bit of a trick – Glenfarclas actually chooses barrels and batches them together so that their combined proof is exactly 60% so that they don’t need to add any water to hit the target number (which would render the result not ‘cask strength’). Glenfarclas uses only sherry casks to mature whisky which previously held oloroso or fino sherry and are either 500 liters (butts) or 250 liters (hogsheads). While there is no age statement the word on the Internet is that the 105 is at least 8 years old. You all know how much I love paying $80 for 8 year-old whisky.Nose Sherry bomb. Dry with most of the fruit notes of the “dried fruit” variety. Dried red currants dried orange peel. Are dried raspberries a thing? If so those too. Other than that a hint of candle wax and surprisingly little nose tickle for such a high ABV.Palate Thin body. Fruit punch gummy candies (Gummi Bears) make an initial impression which is followed by a brief but painful wave of Help-Help-My-Tongue-Is-On-Fire (that’s a medical term). This clears quickly leaving more dried fruits raspberry jam orange peel and those fake gummy bits in that awful shelf-stable vintage Christmas fruitcake. (That’s a professional whisky-taster term. I’m pretty sure I read it in a magazine.)Finish Long. The dried fruits reign. A little bit of vegetal “bramble” appears and fades with the rest. Not bitter but not particularly sweet either.With Water A few drops of water give this some of the sweetness that it’s yearning for and freshens some of the fruit. It lessens the tongue burn very slightly and adds a little vanilla frosting to the finish. Water is decidedly not a bad idea with this whisky.Overall I’m sorry but I don’t like this. I’m generally a sucker for sherry bombs and I’m not shy of cask strength whiskies but I find this very one-dimensional. Back in the day when this was $50 a bottle it made a lot of sense – you got a high-proof sherry-flecked ‘farclas for reasonable money and you didn’t need it to justify itself via quality because it was cheap and big and powerful. Now though at $80 – $90 this thing is competing with the 18 year-olds lagging the price curve not to mention the incredible Corryvreckan and the still-cheaper-but-not-for-long Aberlour A’Bunadh. Against those odds the 105 falls apart. If you find a bottle on closeout for under $60 it’s not a bad dram and if you find yourself stuck with a bottle it would be very useful as a component in house blending. Add oomph and sherry to any house blend. Otherwise I can’t recommend it.
198,Glenfiddich (12 year) - These notes are for the Glenfiddich entry-level 12-year-old distillery bottling with its distinctive triangular green glass bottle.Nose Dry crisp and earthy without any smoke. A hint of fresh-squeezed lime and green grass.Palate Thin watery body. An initial warming wave of caramel popcorn and hot oatmeal with brown sugar. Not picking up any fruit at all. Just a mellow baked sweetness with elements of stale cereal. A very trimmed-down one-sided malt. No oak no peat no sherry. Just easy drinking and easy to pair.Finish Short but with a lingering caramely sweetness.Adding a few drops of water kills whatever nose there was replacing it with maybe a faint floral air – maybe rose? However it brightens up the palate giving some citrusy notes and making it taste a little less stale. I definitely recommend the water with this one at least a few drops. For a bottle in the $25 range it’s unfortunately only a step above the cheapest blends with perhaps a bit more drink-ability than standards like Johnnie Walker or Chivas Regal. It is best suited as a stepping-stone to better malts as The Glenlivet 12 is slightly cheaper and has more complexity and thus deserves the “inexpensive Speysider” spot in your daily rotation.
199,Glenfiddich (14 year) Rich Oak - Ahh… those sweet sweet words “We’re flying back through the U.K. You want us to pick anything up for you?” Every whisky lover drools in anticipation of that exact moment. U.K. pricing! Bottles not available in the U.S.! Duty-free!And then the blank panic sets in. What bottles do I know about that I can’t get here? It used to be Green Spot but now that’s all over the place. Ditto for Yellow Spot and Writers’ Tears. For every independently-bottled cask only released in the U.K. there’s another released in the U.S. now. Quick do a Google search! Usually the Glenfiddich 14 year-old “Rich Oak” release pops up. That sounds safe right?The 14-year Rich Oak uses an experimental finishing technique that appears to have been deemed enough of a success to launch it in 2010 although it still has not ventured Stateside (I hear it’s starting to become available in some LCBO outlets). Standard ex-bourbon aged Glenfiddich is re-casked after 14 years into a mixture of new Spanish oak and new American oak for a brief finishing period of “up to” 12 weeks. This is apparently the first time any single-malt scotch has been finished in new Spanish oak. Alas the final product is bottled at the baseline 40% ABV and priced approximately the same as the tasty but ubiquitous 15 year-old Solera Reserve give or take five bucks.For the record the only whiskies I can think of that are worth picking up while abroad are Springbank products (Springbank Hazelburn Longrow) which are fantastically-better priced outside of the U.S. Similarly anything from Cadenhead’s independent bottling label is probably worth packing away in your checked bags.Nose Nutty with a ton of brown sugar and gingerbread. Beneath that is clear Speyside honeyed and floral. Deep in the glass green apple.Palate Malty marshmallow. Mixed nuts roasted pecans or hazelnuts and some drying oaky tannins. Nice but not amazing.Finish Medium length. Nutty again and on the dry side. Papery walnut skins dry oak.With Water A scant few drops of water brings out more apple and adds green (unripe) banana aromas. The palate is awash with banana now and the finish is grassier. Skip water here especially considering the low ABV.Overall Reminds me a lot of Glenrothes Vintage Reserve – good oaky solid but not changing any minds. I would call it slightly better than Glenfiddich 12 but not so much that I’d be willing to shell out much more cash. At least the Rich Oak delivers on the promise – it tastes like Glenfiddich 12 with 2 more years on it and a heavier oak presence. I’m calling this “Recommended” but with the caveat that the Glenfiddich 15 Solera is significantly better. If the prices are similar – definitely go for the Solera instead even if it means cancelling your plans to fly to Europe to get it.
200,Glenfiddich (15 year) Solera Reserve - I have a story about Glenfiddich 15. I was planning a trip with my long-time friend Mike (he was my best man and I was his) to Las Vegas and I wanted to bring a bottle of something semi-special to share and also to offset the price of drinks at the local bars. I knew that if you’re sitting at a machine or table in Vegas and are offered a free drink it’s not going to be single malt. In fact it’s going to be Dewar’s on the rocks. So given those criteria – something I can pour several glasses of each day without feeling the wallet pinch but something special enough to be the only whisky I consume for four days without much hesitation I went for a bottle of Glenfiddich 15.The 15 is interesting. It’s widely-distributed very cost-effective for a 15 year-old malt and has something that no other (or almost no other) scotch on the market has malt from a modified sherry-style Solera system. It’s miles ahead in quality from Glenfiddich 12 (which is just passably drinkable) but is still usually under $50. It’s got a little sherry flavor a solid ex-bourbon oaky malty base and top-notch craftsmanship.I’m not going to be able to explain the Solera system effectively nor Glenfiddich’s modified version so I’ll summarize it like this They take 15 year-old Glenfiddich from ex-sherry casks ex-bourbon casks and also ex-bourbon hybrids (ex-bourbon casks that were transferred to new oak barrels for 4-6 months). They then mix these into a giant “solera” vat that still contains whisky from previous batches which have been mellowing together in the vat. Since the whisky in the vat is not contained in relatively small oak barrels anymore it does not continue to “age” in the traditional way. The solera vat is never emptied more than halfway which means there are theoretically molecules of whisky in each bottle of Glenfiddich 15 that were first put into the vat in 1998. As batches are drawn from the vat they are married for a few months in a smaller cask and then bottled at 40% ABV.I didn’t bring any Glenfiddich back from Vegas. 😉Review sample taken from a bottle purchased in Autumn 2015.Nose Mild sherry notes golden raisins slightly sulfury bananas dried apricots. Also lemon peel buttercream frosting marzipan. Reminds me a bit of Macallan Gold and also Dalwhinnie 15. It’s not a sherry bomb for sure.Palate Thin body. Golden raisins again plus loads of vanilla coconut water (very weak) nougat and blanched almonds. Very pleasant.Finish Medium-short. Malty with sugar cookies shortbread and faint dried fruits. Never bitter. Fades with some nuttiness (almond butter?).With Water At 40% it can’t take much water but a few drops wakes up a fresh green banana note on the nose and makes the palate a tad sweeter. Optional.Overall A very pleasant albeit middle-of-the-road dram. Miles ahead of Glenfiddich 12 in terms of craftsmanship and general drinkability. It won’t win any individuality awards for flavor or rate in anyone’s top-10 list but it satisfies thoroughly for the price and warrants a consideration for the “basic” little-of-everything spot in your daily dram rotation. It’s also special enough (and has a good story) for gifting and as I discovered in Vegas is drinkable enough to polish a bottle off with friends.
201,Glenfiddich (18 year) - Now as my loyal readers will surely remember I posted a rather uncomplimentary review of Glenfiddich 12 awhile ago and got flamed for it. Let the record show that I was not (and am not now) dismissing the entire distillery of Glenfiddich. This 18 year-old is quite good as you can see from my review below. I stand by my Glenfiddich 12 review – I think it’s simply not as good as The Glenlivet 12 (which is more or less the same price) and doesn’t hold a candle to many of the malts available for $5 or $10 more. The 18 however especially at the fantastic price of $44 that I found recently at Costco in Folsom CA is quite good and I would definitely get another bottle at this price.I’m a big believer in thrift and I think that a whisky tastes better if it was obtained for a better-than-average price. In the same way I have a lot of respect for whisky brands that buck the trend and offer high-quality products for reasonable amounts of money. The now-common industry practice of slapping a clever name on a single-barrel of 11 year old product or a vatting of warehouse leftovers and selling it for $100+ just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and lowers my respect for that company. Imagine my surprise then when I found Glenfiddich 18 for $44 at my local Costco. No matter how you slice it it’s expensive to age any amount of single malt for 18 years so go Glenfiddich! This one has been aged in a combination of Oloroso sherry casks and bourbon casks. The malt was then vatted and married in small batches in oak tuns. My tasting notes follow.Nose A grainy nose tickle with a punch of alcohol behind it. This resolves (especially with a little time resting in the glass) into honeycomb and dried apricot. Cold baklava and cherry syrup with a hint of orange sherbet. A little green grass or herbal tinge – surprising after 18 years in the cask! The wood is not pronounced although there is a telltale whiff of sherry. A dash of water wakes up this slumbering beauty and the fiery nose intensifies. Along with it come firm red stone fruits sour green plums and raspberry jam.Body Medium and mouth-filling but not particularly full or oily.Palate A nutty fieryness upfront. Hazelnuts and pecans. A thin layer of jammy fruits and red currants. Malty cereal and orange-blossom honey. The dash of water releases some younger fruit notes like the aforementioned raspberry jam and green plum. In fact with the hazelnuts and cereal there is a suggestion of nut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. Awesome!Finish Medium-length and warming. More nuttiness in the throat – the hazelnuts particularly. The added water yields a longer back-of-the-tongue finish with a ghost of strawberry hard candies.The delectable hazelnut and honey flavors are many-layered and are supported by an elegant smooth-but-fiery sweet malty character. The sherry is definitely in the background. I wouldn’t call this well-balanced but as the dominant nuttiness is so tasty I definitely recommend it especially if you can find a deal.
202,Glenfiddich Experimental Series – IPA Cask Finish - I have nothing against experimentation in the scotch whisky market. In fact I applaud it on principle. Stodgy adherence to “the way things have always been done” can stifle the creation of newer better products while also preserving the best of the past. Really the industry needs a bit of both. Keep the old traditions when they make better whisky but keep experimenting in case you find an improvement or an alternative. Lately there seems to be a trend with whisky companies bottling and selling their experimental casks sometimes in the middle of the ongoing experiment. The largest such effort I’ve seen has been the Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection. If you ever wanted to know the difference in taste between the bottom middle and top of a tree go ahead and Google up some Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection. Sometimes this type of public experimentation leads to products that should have never seen the shelf or bald-faced marketing drivel. Sometimes it leads to tasty stuff.Here we have something new. Whisky is (sort of) distilled beer right? And most (almost all) beer contains hops to some degree. So why not age whisky in casks that previously held heavily-hopped India Pale Ale style beer? Actually this is not totally new but it’s a valiant idea. A collaboration between Speyside brewer Seb Jones and Glenfiddich’s malt master Brian Kinsman a specially-brewed IPA ale using Challenger hops was aged for 4 weeks in used Glenfiddich American Oak barrels which were then emptied and used to finish Glenfiddich single malt for 12 weeks. The result was bottled without an age statement at 43% ABV and retails for well a lot.My sample was from Lot 17 04 7983 whatever that means.Nose Maybe I’m going nuts but this just smells like Glenfiddich to me. A bit of oak some sunny nutty malt a little orange peel and deep in the glass a hint of banana and walnut.Palate Mild slightly syrupy body. Banana again. A tad hot for 43% ABV. Are there hops? Now I’m “power of suggestion”-ing myself. Yes that was an awkward way to phrase that and I’m OK with it. There is definitely a hint of herbaceous hoppy flavor with an accompanying twinge of grassy bitterness. Hops! Experiment a success! Ship it!Finish Short. Minty with a cooling (instead of drying) effect. Fades quickly.With Water A few drops of water release a lemony note that takes over the aroma for a bit. The hops might be more noticeable on the palate now but that could also just be because I know what to look for. Finish is vaguely sweeter.Overall OK well I don’t dislike it. I also don’t think it particularly tastes or smells like an IPA. In fact tasted blind the words “IPA” and “hops” would have never entered my mind. I doubt I would have even detected the unusual menthol effect on the finish or the herby quality on the tongue. That said it’s a tasty Glenfiddich that I certainly like more than the 12 year and even maybe the 15 year (some of the flavors remind me of the 18 year).If nothing else you should not be put off from trying this expression if you aren’t into IPA or heavily-hopped beer. At more than $60 however I balk at the idea of paying out of pocket for Glenfiddich’s own experimental whisky program. Crowdfunded R&D is trendy or whatever but that doesn’t mean I appreciate being on the “crowd” side of it.Finally MAN that’s a pretty bottle…
203,Glenfiddich Malt Master’s Edition - I am somewhat divided on Glenfiddich malts. Despite being one of the few ‘household names’ in the U.S. in the single malt category I have trouble reconciling its excellent older malts with its frankly disappointing mass-market 12 year-old. The Solera-cask 15 is excellent. The partially-sherry-aged 18-year is a good malt at a great price. The new Glenfiddich Malt Master’s Edition appears at first glance to be a good malt at a bad price.I can picture the boardroom discussion. Boardmember A “Malts are booming why aren’t we cashing in on price increases?” Boardmember B “Because we’re known in the market for value. You can’t alienate customers by raising prices for no reason.” Boardmember A “Why not? Everyone else is.” Boardmember C “I’ve got it! Let’s release a non-age-statement vatting with a fancy name and slap an $80 pricetag on it!” Everyone “Genius!”This is a “double wood” much like sister distillery Balvenie’s eponymous classic. It is aged for the majority of its life in ex-bourbon and then given a secondary maturation (not just a finish) in sherry casks. The only difference between the two malts? Balvenie DoubleWood is around $40. This is $80. Why? DoubleWood is 12 years old. Malt Master’s Edition is 6-8 years in ex-bourbon followed by 4-6 years in ex-sherry. That puts it somewhere between 10 and 14 years old. So… 12 on average. According to the press release this is the first Glenfiddich malt to be transferred entirely from bourbon barrels to a prolonged maturation in sherry barrels as opposed to the 18-year for example where barrels of each type are blended together in large batches to get the target flavor profile. This seems like a weak basis for an $80 price tag to me although it could be argued that the barrels selected for this malt are of higher quality and thus more valuable than the “run of the mill” barrels that get dumped into the mass-market varieties. Unfortunately that’s a consideration that can’t be quantified – we just have to take Glenfiddich’s word that this whisky is worth $80. Let’s find out.Nose Clear components of pear and crisp apple. Cider. Slightly winey with red grape skins and a mild sour note. Golden raisins and vanilla. This really strikes a chord with me – pear and apple notes are among my favorites. So far better than DoubleWood.Palate Nice caramel apple notes. Round and sweet. Medium-bodied. Granola and golden raisins. Somewhat disappointing – there’s not a lot going on here. It tastes like a slightly younger slightly blander version of the 18-year.Finish Sticky toffee pudding. Malty and mildly oaky on the tail end not overly bitter. Walnut on the fade-out. Maybe I missed something but this isn’t a strong finish for me.With Water Opens up some banana notes and various florals – honeysuckle? Palate is washed out and bland. I don’t suggest water with this.Overall Very nice. The nose is a surprise with mouth-watering fruit notes that stand out clearly. It gets somewhat too sweet in the finish where the subtle notes are washed away by the sticky caramelly sugar. Reminds me of some Glenrothes without as much in-your-face sherry. Delicate and accomplished and clearly better than the similar-but-cheaper Balvenie DoubleWood 12.I have to concede that this is better than DoubleWood 12. However it doesn’t warrant the same price tag that is carried by amazing malts like Ardbeg Corryvreckan or Talisker 18 (yeah I know those are peated but the point stands). If I were pricing it blind I would have said $55 tops. Although as we’ve all seen recently in the market… $80 is the new $50.
204,Glenglassaugh 26 year - I got the chance to try re-opened distillery Glenglassaugh’s new products at K&L’s first Wednesday tasting at the Redwood City location as well as the 26 year-old bottling from casks filled before the distillery closed in 1986. It was interesting to see the vast difference that 26 years in an oak barrel makes effectively turning vodka into the fine malt whisky that we know and love.The 26 year-old Glenglassaugh was bottled at 46% ABV in late 2010 26 years after being casked around 1984. The distillery was mothballed 2 years later in 1986. There is evident sherry influence although I don’t know what percentage of time it spent in sherry casks.Nose Plum pungent florals. Resolves into a lot of banana. Would benefit from some airing-out time in the glass. (Alas I didn’t give it much).Palate Spices (clove?) vanilla custard and piping-hot bananas foster. Smooth and light. Prunes.Finish Woody with round tannins and fading wood spices (cinnamon). Light. Short finish surprisingly.Overall Smooth and well-rounded with light sherry influence. Unfortunately it has a lot of that banana flavor that I keep finding and dislike. For a 26 year-old Scotch I wasn’t very impressed. Maybe it’s just me and my banana hangup. Note that the $250 price tag reflects the rarity and soon-to-be-extinct nature of this particular whisky. That makes it collectible I suppose but unless you have a chance to try it (and like it a lot more than I did) I don’t recommend that you buy any.
205,"Glenglassaugh Clearac and Fledgling XB - I got the chance to try re-opened distillery Glenglassaugh’s new products at K&L’s first Wednesday tasting at the Redwood City location as well as the 26 year-old bottling from casks filled before the distillery closed in 1986. This was my first taste of a new-make spirit which is the clear alcohol that flows from the stills when malt whisky is made. Had this sat in oak barrels in Scotland for three years it could have been labeled as single-malt Scotch whisky. Instead it has to be categorized as a lowly “spirit drink” or “new-make spirit.” Young spirits like this give a fascinating glimpse into the process of maturation. By comparing a whisky fresh from the stills to one that has aged for several years it becomes abundantly clear how many flavor compounds are derived from the wood. New-make spirits also give a hint of where the distillery is headed and show promise that may (or may not) come to delicious fruition in a decade or so.First the Clearac new-make spirit bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV). This was a 1/4 oz pour so I didn’t have an opportunity to try adding some water.Nose Fragile fruit with a wave of vodka-like industrial glue. Some nice fresh raspberry mint leaves rose water. Floral.
Palate High burn at 100 proof but the raspberry continues with a round sweet white rum character.
Finish Short with more vodka flavor and a ghost of green apple.
Overall A lot of vodka style but with interesting fresh fruity notes and nice florals. Some honeysuckle? Very light despite the high burn. A pleasant new make rather like an artisan vodka. Frankly if it weren’t so expensive I’d rather put this in a martini!Next the Fledgling XB. Also bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV) after maturation for just one year in ex-bourbon casks (hence the ‘XB’ moniker).Nose Super light caramel or butterscotch with the faintest suggestion of wood chips. Still some of the vodka graininess but less so than the new-make.
Palate Moderate burn with some vanilla and warming sweet baked goods.
Finish Nice and of medium length – more bakery notes specifically sugar cookies. Nice.
Overall Like the Clearac there is a lot of vodka-like grain alcohol flavor (like glue) but the fruits are replaced by sugar cookies. Again light in style.The company also sells a similar peated new-make and a new-make aged for 6 months in red wine barrels. All are small 200ml bottles.Note I would have rated these higher but for $26 for a 200ml bottle you can do much better. If you have an opportunity to taste them however it’s an education in new-make Scotch which is rare outside of distillery visits."
206,Glengoyne (10 year) - Both Glengoyne 12-year and 10-year appear to be on the US market at the same time which is a little odd. Usually distilleries stick to one of the classic “flagship” ages. The 12 retails for $10-$15 more than the 10 and my review of the 12 year shows that I appreciated that one as budget sherry bomb. This 10 year-old (which is the only one of the two I can find near me) is the same bottling strength (43%) also has no added coloring and also uses both ex-bourbon and sherry casks (like The Balvenie DoubleWood and about a zillion other malts these days). Both are apparently not chill-filtered (see comments). As far as I can tell the 2 years of maturation and the $10-$15 of price are the only differences.Glengoyne technically classed as a Highland whisky toes the Highland line some 20 miles north of Glasgow. In fact its warehouses sit on the south side of the road in the Lowlands! There likely aren’t many whiskies that can claim to be distilled in the Highlands and aged in the Lowlands. Glengoyne is a small facility with limited production which may contribute to its consistently high-quality malt.The distillery’s marketing – including right on the bottle labels – is very adamant that the whisky has absolutely no peat character at all either from the process water or from the barley which is unusual at zero ppm (even traditionally unpeated Highlanders like Glenlivet have around 2 ppm). The distillery has a right to market its insistence on showcasing the barley as it is one of two remaining producers that use Golden Promise barley. The other is The Macallan. Golden Promise is considered to be of higher quality but much more expensive to grow than high-yield commercial strains. Glengoyne uses a mix of first-fill sherry refill sherry and ex-bourbon casks although its whisky is immediately recognizable as a sherried Highland-style whisky.Nose Sherry! Fresh fruit green apple and fresh snappy pear in spades. Kefir lime leaves and faintly sweet malt. The sherry is dominant here. Mild nose tickle.Palate Thin body. Mild to moderate tongue burn. Tropical fruits (kiwi fresh coconut) mildly herbal (anise cardamom) and just a little bit of bitterness. Not as tart as the aroma implied.Finish Medium-short. Some slightly-bitter barrel char. Vague without much of the fruit but with some of the herbs. Fades without evolving.With Water The addition of a few drops of water muddy the tropical fruits and add only a little sweetness in the form of bland white sugar. The palate is thinner but the finish has some sparkle and a little of the missing tartness. I’d probably skip the water at 43% ABV but you could see if it does anything for you.Overall The aroma promises more than the palate can deliver but it’s still a pleasant dram with nice fruit flavors. The sherry notes which dominate are definitely of the “fresh tropical fruit” variety and not of the “dried and jammy fruit” variety. There are no off-notes and the whisky’s balance is well-struck. I snagged my bottle on closeout for $27 making it a steal but I’d be just about as happy with this at $40. Much above that and the value falls away. If you have access to both the 10 and the 12 I think that the 12 is better and worth an extra $10-$15 but I wouldn’t pay more than $50 for it.
207,Glengoyne (12 year) - Glengoyne technically classed as a Highland whisky toes the Highland line some 20 miles north of Glasgow. In fact its warehouses sit on the south side of the road in the Lowlands! There likely aren’t many whiskies that can claim to be distilled in the Highlands and aged in the Lowlands. Glengoyne is a small facility with limited production which may contribute to its consistently high-quality malt. I must confess I knew nothing about the distillery until I tried this sample and was immediately impressed by both the quality and refinement in such a relatively unknown 12 year-old scotch.Glengoyne’s marketing is very adamant that the whisky has absolutely no peat character at all either from the process water or from the barley which is unusual at zero ppm (even traditionally unpeated Highlanders like Glenlivet have around 2 ppm). The distillery has a right to market its insistence on showcasing the barley as it is one of two remaining producers that use Golden Promise barley. The other is The Macallan. Golden Promise is considered to be of higher quality but much more expensive to grow than high-yield commercial strains. The distillery uses a mix of first-fill sherry refill sherry and ex-bourbon casks although its whisky is immediately recognizable as a sherried Highland-style whisky. The 12-year now bottled at 43% ABV also uses some first-fill Hogshead ex-bourbon barrels – a first for Glengoyne. All Glengoyne has natural color but this bottling (and all other Glengoyne except the cask-strength version) is chill-filtered.Update If you can’t find the 12 here’s my review for the 10-year.Nose Hot. Faint elements of sherry – mildly nutty and fruity. Shy – I can’t determine much from the nose. After a rest in the glass there’s a bit of caramel.Palate Soft and silky. Light fruits and nut butters initially very well integrated. Like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in distilled form – very unlike anything else I’ve tried although it reminds me a bit of Glenrothes.Finish The sherry is more dominant on the finish with distinct notes of berry jam and fruit juice. Fades with hazelnuts and no bitterness.With Water Water fails to wake up the nose and does nothing interesting for the palate. I’d skip the water.Overall This malt has a lot going for it. Despite the recalcitrant nose there is a delectable balance of nutty and fruity notes on the palate that is unrivaled by sherried malts in this price range. The balance here is impeccable and the finish is flawless – no overly-wooded character flaws. While I still prefer GlenDronach for all-in sherry this malt contends with Balvenie DoubleWood 12 for the “mid-priced partially sherried malt” slot in my cabinet.Note This new bottling (added alongside the existing 12 year-old cask strength bottling) may be difficult to find in the US. The 17 is apparently even better and reasonably priced between $50 and $60.
208,Glengoyne Cask Strength (Batch 4) - I can’t get enough of heavily sherried single malt scotches colloquially known as “sherry bombs”. I was in favor of Glengoyne’s 12 year-old bottling although it didn’t quite qualify in the “bomb” category so I was interested to see how the producer’s NAS Cask Strength release compares to similar heavy-hitters like Aberlour A’Bunadh and Glenfarclas 105. As usual with big corporate spirits websites Glengoyne’s is gorgeous but provides exactly no useful information about the making of this dram. That ever-flowing font of questionably-sourced information The Internet reveals that this release replaces an earlier 12 year-old cask strength edition which is a sad but oft-repeated refrain in today’s insane whisky market. One can thus deduce that the average age of this bottling hovers somewhere between 9 and 12. Some equally unsubstantiated information suggests that this batch was aged exclusively in first- and second-fill sherry casks.Glengoyne’s whisky is distilled from Golden Promise barley a low-yield heritage strain of barley used rarely in today’s big-volume whisky industry (The Macallan is also known for using the strain). Glengoyne is also notable for the speed of its distillation (purportedly the “slowest” in Scotland) its total lack of peat even in the process water and its location very near or perhaps on top of the invisible line dividing the Highlands and the Lowlands of Scotland. The Cask Strength batches are bottled without added coloring and without chill-filtration. I tasted a sample from Batch #4.For reviews of the non-cask-strength editions see Glengoyne 10 and Glengoyne 12.For an interesting meta-analysis of batch variability see selfbuilt’s Whisky Analysis of this Glengoyne.Nose Sherry bomb. Unlike Glenfarclas 105 this sherry is more resinous and jammy with blackberry blackcurrant and fig notes reminiscent of the house style of GlenDronach. There is also a deep caramel note.Palate Thin body. The sherry translates directly to the tongue with the same berry notes. After an intense fiery tongue burn notes of dark chocolate fig and browned pie crust dominate.Finish Medium-long. Here the fruit notes are more dried specifically dried cherries. The chocolate remains which is a nice combination and both remain long enough to convey a chocolate-covered cherry coincidence. A little bitterness invades as the rest fades.With Water A few drops of water add a tinge of vanilla to the nose and seem to improve the body. The dark chocolate notes become a little closer to milk chocolate for what that’s worth. I recommend a little water with this especially at a whopping 58.8% ABV.Overall A pleasant but fiery dram worthy of both the names Glengoyne and Cask Strength. Like Aberlour A’Bunadh this delivers both sherry and alcohol in a one-two punch. Between the two I prefer the Aberlour’s fresher fruits. Still when A’Bunadh reaches the $100-ish mark later this year you might still be able to find Glengoyne’s cask strength batches in the $60 to $80 range which would make it the new king of value when it comes to cask-strength sherry bombs. This is especially true when compared to the other “value” choice in cask-strength sherry bombs Glenfarclas 105 which I think shrivels in comparison to this. With those chocolate notes I could see this alternating with A’Bunadh for the cask-strength sherried spot in anyone’s cabinet.
209,Glenkinchie (12 year) - I think of Glenkinchie one of the few remaining Lowland single malts as “the lemon malt” although its actual nickname is “The Edinburgh Malt” for its location some 15 miles from the capital of Scotland. Glenkinchie was relatively obscure (used mostly in blends) before it became one of the jewels in Diageo’s Classic Malts crown representing the Lowlands. The standard 10 year-old expression was recently replaced by this 12 year-old. The only other official bottling is a Distiller’s Edition finished in Amontillado sherry casks.Nose Slightly smoky (earthy peat but mild). Dirty honey malty grains but not particularly sweet. If I really dig into the glass some lemon oil.Palate Thin body. Grain-forward with complex sooty smoke. Lemon hard candies.Finish Lemon (Pledge?). Slightly bitter; charcoal.With Water A few drops of water release a lot of bright tangy lemon on the nose and palate. I recommend a few drops of water with this one.Overall Nothing outright bad but all of the tasty-sounding lemons and honey and smoky malt all come across as sooty bitter or stale. Water does help with a boost in the tart lemon/lemonade character which provides better balance and more dynamism. Still this isn’t something that everyone will be happy with after a blind purchase. If this were competing at entry-level tier of $30 to $40 it would be a solid choice. Instead at regularly more than $50 it’s hard to recommend.
210,Glenmorangie (18 year) - I spend so much time with Glenmorangie’s wine finishes (like their transcendent Nectar D’Or 12 year) that I forget the whisky has a “standard” baseline represented by its 12- and 18-year-old expressions. The first is matured only in ex-bourbon barrels including the barrels sourced by the company in the forests of Missouri especially for their barrel program. This is a great example of Glenmorangie’s commitment to quality (wow I sound like my employer’s Marketing department) and their willingness to innovate. They actually go to the Ozark Mountains of Missouri hand-pick slow-growth American white oak trees air season them (rather than artificially quick-drying) for two years and then lend them to bourbon producers to use in their own maturation. To me that says something about the company’s dedication to doing it right. It’s also a sound strategy for ensuring the quality of their barrels considering many Cambeltown distilleries lost their reputations by using fish barrels during American Prohibition! Way to learn from the past Glenmorangie.The flagship 18-year is a marriage of 70% ex-bourbon matured malt and 30% oloroso sherry-finished (for 3 years). It is not advertised as being non-chill-filtered which probably means it has been filtered. Ditto for the addition of coloring. Nose Lemony with light notes of green pear lemon-lime soda and golden raisins. Subtle… too subtle?Palate Banana taffy lemon drop and nougat. Interesting flavor profile while remaining light and airy. Some woodiness intrudes.Finish Oaky with some bitter char notes. Medium-long. Turns nutty with clear walnut skins.Overall Very nice but super light and not particularly concentrated despite the 18 years of aging. It’s mildly complex with some interesting fruit notes that I didn’t expect. While not disappointing this isn’t going to knock anyone’s socks off and I can see why even Glenmorangie doesn’t try to price this above $99. Perhaps Glenmo malt really serves better as a canvas for wine finishes.
211,Glenmorangie Artein - Glenmorangie has become the king of wine finishes. With their wildly popular Nectar d’Or (Sauternes wine finish) and their continued commitment to limited-edition releases and out-of-the-box experimentation. Their latest the Artein is finished in casks of Sassicaia a red Italian wine – one of the “Super Tuscans”. A vatting of two-thirds 15 year-old Glenmorangie with one-third 21 year-old both matured in American white oak ex-bourbon casks Artein then spends an additional “period of time” (probably less than a year) in the wine casks. Frankly I’d never heard of Sassicaia or “Super Tuscans” until researching this post. Clearly I’m not much of a wine guy.The ‘Artein’ moniker (Scots Gaelic for ‘stone’) refers to both the rocky soil in which the Sassicaia vines grow and the mineral influence of the natural Scottish spring water used to make the whisky. The story is a bit of a stretch but it makes for some gripping marketing material. 😉The interesting thing that I’ve noticed about wine – specifically red wine – finishes (I’ve only had a handful) they typically don’t absorb the kinds of flavors one associates with red wines – deep berries dark red fruits licorice and spices. Instead these whiskies tend to become somewhat astringent – sour raspberries and an overwhelming aspect of grappa – the Italian spirit created by distilling a mash of pressed grape skins and seeds. The grappa – an unforgettable barrage on the palate that mostly tastes like sour grape skins – dominates here as wellNose Cranberry in droves up front then grape skins and grappa cover everything like a wet blanket.Palate Silky and robust. Red apple fresh tart cranberries lots of bright fresh fruits and fruit candies (fruit chews).Finish Malty at last with dried blueberries. Not bitter! Medium long.With Water A splash of water dulls the nose and adds some citrus. Rounds out the palate but seems unnecessary to me.Overall Very nice but nothing really special – just a wine finish Glenmo and an education in the domineering effect that red wine casks have on maturing scotch. I might pay $60 not $80.
212,Glenmorangie Bacalta - Glenmorangie will be forever in my mind a “blank slate” malt which takes to barrel finishes like Velcro. Glenmo to me has no house style and changes itself chameleon-like with each new release. The 8th “Private Edition” (what exactly is private about these?) Bacalta for instance is aged in standard ex-bourbon casks and then finished in Malmsey Madeira wine casks. Apparently “Bacalta” is Scots Gaelic for “Baked” and these casks were at one point “baked under the sun” or some nonsense. Personally I think that means someone forgot the shipment from Madeira had arrived in the parking lot and left the barrels there for a few weeks before someone brought them inside but maybe I’m a skeptic.Whatever your feelings for NAS whiskies ridiculous names with stories to go with them or $110 annual releases this damn stuff is tasty. I’m a sucker for round malty whisky finished in sweet fortified wine casks and Bacalta delivers on that front at least.The Internet the wisdom and reliability of which Shall Not Be Questioned has revealed that Bacalta (like most Glenmorangie Private Edition releases) began as 10 year-old “Original” Glenmorangie and was aged for 2 years in the madeira casks. We can be reasonably assured that the whisky is thus 12 years of age. Without an age statement on the bottle however that could all be a giant lie. Caveat emptor and all that.Oh and hey LVMH don’t think I haven’t noticed that these annual “money pit” special editions have been stealthily increasing in price every year. That said I guess one shouldn’t be looking at products from Louis Vuitton for value.Nose Raw honey light jammy resin (think marmalade) and sultanas (golden raisins) greet the nose. Deeply sweet this is unarguably a dessert whisky and bears (so far) a striking resemblance to Glenmorangie’s Nectar D’Or. There may be more depth here however with an interplay of bubble gum tutti-fruiti glazed scones and apricot jam. Yum.Palate Thin body. A mild initial tongue burn gives way to more honey sweetness. Golden raisins again lemon bundt cake cake frosting candied ginger and orange creamsicle.Finish Medium-long and warming. Raw honey pervades and fades with more apricot marzipan and absolutely no bitterness. Decadent.With Water A few drops of water seem to have no effect except maybe to make the liquid’s texture on the tongue more silky or syrupy (odd). Water is fully not necessary with this and I prefer it at the bottled strength.Overall A fantastic dram for those that like sweet things in their whisky. The madeira effect is less of wine and more of deeply sugary treats. All of the tastes and smells that come to mind are dripping with crystalized sugar and deep concentrated fruits. Unlike a heavily sherried whisky where those fruits are dark and jammy and resinous these are fresh and sweet and vibrant. Objectively Bacalta tastes like an amped-up Nectar D’Or with fewer tart fruits and more honey and stewed stone fruits. Absolutely lovely but spendy. This is probably only worth $110 to you if you’re comfortable in general with dropping more than $100 on a bottle of whisky. If not stick to Nectar D’Or and enjoy the 50% discount.
213,"Glenmorangie Companta - Glenmorangie keeps cranking out the special editions. This one I bought as a special treat for myself since I rarely spend $99 on a single bottle. Companta has the distinction of being the first whisky I’ve tried to successfully marry single-malt scotch with red wine casks. Every previous attempt I’ve tasted including Glenmorangie’s own Artein have been abject astringent failures for me.Companta is a convoluted vatting of standard 9 year-old ex-bourbon Glenmorangie that is finished for 5 years in red Grand Cru Burgundy wine casks from Clos de Tart (from Pinot Noir grapes) with a similar 10 year-old Glenmorangie finished for 8 years in “a lusciously sweet fortified wine from Cotes du Rhone” called Rasteau made from Grenache grapes. The vatting contains 60% of the first and 40% of the second. Now that’s a whisky spec I can get behind!The resulting marriage is bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration just like I like it.Nose First a waft of dense red grape juice and a raisin-y syrup note that is very similar to sherried Glenmorangie. From there it diverges quickly into nutty nougat milk chocolate fresh (really fresh!) juicy red grapes. Well-layered and of impeccable quality.Palate Thin to medium bodied. Tart red wine dark chocolate-covered cherries roasted mixed nuts. The tart notes are in no way astringent or tannic. The impression overall is of bright fresh red grapes nuts and chocolate. Delicious especially as a dessert.Finish Medium-long. Echoes of the original aromas nuts chocolate fruit and some taffy. As it fades the chocolate note becomes more like bittersweet chocolate or cocoa nib.With Water At 46% it certainly doesn’t need intervention with water. A few drops do a little to heighten the fresh fruit but at the expense of the chocolate. Mildly sweeter – caramel – on the palate but with a bit more tongue burn. Really I’d skip the water it doesn’t need it.Overall A truly impressive dram. Glenmorangie malt has always been a canvas for barrel-induced flavor but I haven’t always totally appreciated the paint. In this case Glenmorangie’s Dr. Bill Lumsden pulls off two feats in one an eminently enjoyable rich desserty chocolatey confection AND the first single-malt I’ve ever enjoyed that contains liquid aged in any kind of unfortified red wine cask. The red wine here rather than being its typical astringent seedy grappa-like self is decadent and blends flawlessly with the nutty and chocolatey notes. Instead of sour wine plus whisky this is an integrated whole – fresh grapes dipped in dark chocolate-hazelnut fondue. Yum.
Is it worth $100? It was for me but as a splurge. If you love sherried malt wine-finished malt or Glenmorangie in general and have $100 to spend on whisky this will not disappoint. If you were on the fence grab a bottle before it’s gone."
214,Glenmorangie Finealta - Ahh Glenmorangie. I can honestly say I’ve never tasted a Glenmorangie that I disliked. Perhaps there have been a few that I didn’t think were worth the money but they have all delivered superior flavor consistency and exquisite craftsmanship. Glenmorangie always tastes… clean; Polished – all imperfections worn away to a crisp flawless shine. This is in comparison to Springbank for example which is (intentionally) full of burrs and switchbacks and rough edges and has a more… rustic charm.Finealta another of a series of “Private Edition” special releases from the distillery is way past news. First arriving for general release in January of 2011 Finealta is still variously available in 2013 while the “limited edition” liquid lasts. I never claimed to be on top of whisky news so when I was gifted a bottle of Finealta for Christmas (Thanks Lou!) I resolved to write a review regardless of the delay. Think of this as “The Scotch Noob Cold Case” and play along!In an effort (or so the marketing nonsense would have us believe) to re-create the recipe of a Glenmorangie single-malt that was delivered in 1903 to the Savoy Hotel in London England Dr. Bill Lumsden combined a few casks from their ‘curiosities’ warehouse. Imagine this guy’s job wander through a warehouse of experimental Glenmorangie malt sampling as you go to find the perfect marriage of disparate styles. Imagine the whiskies in that warehouse!The 1903 malt would have been peated and likely aged in ex-sherry casks thus the re-created whisky is “lightly” peated and aged in a combination of American white oak (ex-bourbon) and ex-Oloroso sherry casks. It is bottled without added color and without chill-filtration at 46% ABV which is music to my ears. Or eyes. Or nose? Whatever. It’s a good sign. The whole thing is modestly priced at $70 – $80 which is really not bad these days for a “special edition” with this level of quality.Nose Dried apricots and cherries. A very mild fruity smoke – like applewood chips just beginning to smolder or peaches charring on the barbeque. The Oloroso sherry is most apparent in the aroma. After a rest in the glass there is some bubblegum and vanilla taffy.Palate Oh hey yeah it IS peated! Charcoal briquets and dry garden soil. The sherry is evident here too – cherry lozenges and trail mix dried fruit. The tongue burn is just right – 46% ABV I love you.Finish Medium-long. A touch of dark chocolate another wave of cherry a suggestion of tobacco (the aftertaste of a cigar on one’s lips) and a faint lingering echo of charcoal.With Water A few drops of water give the nose a minor sour note – cider vinegar? – and livens up the palate. It’s worth a try with some water but don’t drown it.Overall I’m not sure if this evokes the era of the Savoy Hotel or the Age of Enlightenment or whatever the website says but it’s a fine straightforward dram with a lot of refined flavor. The fruit is in delicate balance with the admittedly mild peat character and the wood does not overpower. All is in alignment – Glenmorangie continues to know what they’re doing – all is well with the world.
215,Glenmorangie Lasanta (12 year) (46% ABV Presentation) - Somehow I keep bypassing Glenmorangie products… perhaps because there are so damn many. The Lasanta at 12 years of age is in the same “Extra Matured” Series as Quinta Ruban and Nectar d’Or. This one after the same initial 10 years in ex-bourbon spent 2 years in Oloroso sherry casks. This makes it “sherry finished” as opposed to “sherry matured” which means it isn’t really apt to compare it to Macallan or GlenDronach or other whiskies aged fully (or predominantly) in ex-sherry. Of course the whole idea of the “Extra Matured” Series is to showcase Glenmorangie whisky as a canvas for other flavors and Lasanta delivers. It also helps that Glenmorangie products have remained (almost) immune to the run-up in whisky prices endemic through the industry. The fact that you can still get 12 year-old sherry-finished Glenmorangie for under $45 is both remarkable AND a reason to buy it… especially if your favorite sherried Speysider has priced itself out of your reach.Lasanta is bottled at 46% ABV and is not chill-filtered. Note that in late 2014 Lasanta was lowered from 46% ABV to 43% ABV. This review is from one of the older (46% ABV) bottles.Nose Evident sherry – dried fruits and dusty caramel. As this is finished in sherry not matured in it the effect is milder and the fruit less robust than Macallan or GlenDronach.Palate Alternating sweet and tart fruit. Good integration between fruit jam and the layers of caramel and soft cereals. Good amount of flavor for a $45 single malt.Finish Medium-long. A little on the hot side but with some nice concentrated dried mixed fruit. Ends slightly bitter with a touch of nuttiness.With Water Reveals a burst of raspberry coulis but the alcohol vapor gets a little hot. Slightly sweeter – brown sugar – on the palate and more fruit on the finish. Definitely give some water a shot.Overall This is a respectable sherry-tinged malt that is very definitely worth $45 of your money. It’s regularly available consistent in quality and can be absentmindedly enjoyed or analyzed in turn. For a desert island I prefer its pricier sibling the Nectar d’Or but the two are in no way similar – you could easily find room on your shelf for both.Note I’ve marked this as ‘Must Try’ because it’s a quintessential part of any whisky lover’s journey as is Quinta Ruban. It may not find a permanent spot on your shelf (especially if you’ve ‘graduated’ to pricier malts) but it’s a case study in the effects of sherry finishing and the adaptability of Glenmorangie’s malt.
216,"Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or (12 year) - I tasted a glass of the Glenmorangie Nectar d’Or at C.B. Hannegan’s last week. Here are my notesColor Liquid goldNose Riesling grapes honey floral lilac and clover blossom.Palate Body like liquid gold. Attack is heavy with clover honey in both flavor and firmness of texture. It tastes like a glass of dessert wine on fire. When developing some spiciness cinnamon or nutmeg and vanilla. Surprisingly one-dimensional on first taste with the Sauternes flavor overwhelming the cereal sweetness. However for shear desserty pleasure this one is hard to beat. Subsequent tastes reveal more complexity – surely there is a lot left to discover.Finish is medium long with more cereal notes but little else. A lingering ghost of spice – vanilla chai. Also some toffee?Addition of a few drops of water did not to my mind improve this dram. I prefer it in its pure sugary glory.
"
217,Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban (12 year) - Update This edition has been replaced by a 14 year-old version reviewed here.These days with scotch prices rising like lost balloons above an amusement park one must look harder than ever to find reasonable deals to keep the scotch bug fed. Lately I’ve been surprised to see Glenmorangie bucking the industry trend and keeping their prices more or less stable. This especially from “luxury” brand LVMH endears them to me more than ever. A quick review of Internet prices shows that Glenmorangie costs the same as it did when I started blogging two and half years ago The 10 year-old “Original” below $35 the 12 year-old Quinta Ruban and Lasanta at $46 the Sauternes-finished 12-year Nectar d’Or at $65 (Sauternes casks are expensive) and the 18 year-old at $90 (WAY low for a quality 18 year-old malt especially now).While I’ve always been a proponent of the Sauternes-finished Nectar d’Or I’ve only had a passing familiarity with the “other two” wine finishes from Glenmorangie Both at 12 years of age Quinta Ruban is finished in port casks and Lasanta in not-particularly-novel sherry casks. Neither is going to win any awards for best-in-category but at $46 they present value that’s pretty much unequaled in the wine-finished single-malt group. Consider other port finishes on the market Balvenie’s 21 year-old port finish is $200 Springbank’s 14 year-old port finish upwards of $90 and even GlenDronach’s 15 year-old tawny port finish is $70 as is BenRiach’s equivalent tawny finish and neither is available in the US.Quinta Ruban is like the Lasanta and Nectar d’Or aged for 10 years in American white-oak (read ex-bourbon) casks. (They probably use the same whisky that goes into the 10-year “Original” which is aged in a combination of first- and second-fill ex-bourbon barrels). This is followed by a 2-year dip in port pipes imported from the “quintas” or port-producing wine estates of Portugal. A port pipe is a lengthened barrel with tapered ends used to mature port. Quinta Ruban is bottled at the perfect strength (46% ABV) and is not chill-filtered. This or the Lasanta is pretty much a must for any value-conscious malt drinker’s cabinet.Nose The port finish comes through as a bouquet of fruit aromas. While not specifically smelling like port the malt has elements of fresh grapes raisins cherries and so on. The fruit character is fresher and more tart than the sticky dried-fruit profile of sherry aging. Some vanilla oak underlies – but does not compete with – the fruit. Well-balanced refreshing and thankfully not cloying.Palate Medium bodied with initial aspects of caramel or nougat. A tad on the burny side. The fruit is fainter but more reminiscent of ruby port.Finish Medium-long. Caramel again and marshmallow. The fruit returns only as a faint candy coating as the whole fades into mild barrel char.With Water Water awakens some indistinct tart fruit on the nose but also something like sulphur. Perhaps it’s the chlorine in the water where I’m tasting (I’m on vacation!) but I don’t enjoy the addition of water here.Overall Port finishing is not common but is always a welcome pairing for a single malt especially one as well-suited to cask manipulation as Glenmorangie. Unlike other port finishes Quinta Ruban is priced to be accessible. While it cannot compete with say a Springbank port-finish for complexity at $46 it is a satisfying dram with pleasing flavors and especially aromas. You can do a lot worse with $46.Note I’ve upgraded this to a “Must Try” – really if you haven’t had Quinta Ruban and especially if you’re frustrated by price increases this is your next bottle.
218,Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban (14 year) - Quinta Ruban has been one of my favorite budget single malts since I first reviewed the 12 year-old version (which has been replaced by this 14-year) back in 2013. Looking back I was complaining about price increases back then too! 7 years later the Quinta Ruban has also fallen victim to the across-the-board price increases in the modern whisky market and I found a bottle at my local soulless liquor megamart for $57. That’s not too bad really considering 7 years of blockbuster whisky demand and an extra two years of maturation and 3% ABV. It used to cost $46 ish and actually can still be found for that price if you dig around online.Quinta Ruban is standard Glenmorangie malt that is aged around 12 years in ex-bourbon casks and then finished in ruby port wine casks for 2 further years for a total age statement of 14 years. The old 12-year expression spent 10 years in ex-bourbon. The whisky is bottled without chill-filtration at 46% ABV. No mention is made of coloring so I’m guessing the color is corrected with spirit caramel.Nose The first note is strangely barnyard-y like a musty cellar or animal barn. This doesn’t fade but is quickly overtaken by a round juicy sweet ruby port note that is somewhere in between candy apple and berry preserves. The two opposing notes combine into balsamic or rancio and balance out. The port note does seem to drown out the malt which stays resolutely in the background. Note The barnyard note fades as the bottle rests – my second glass a few weeks later was much better-balanced and with less of an off-note.Palate Medium bodied almost syrupy. A robust tongue burn brings notes of cinnamon and jalapeno jelly and then recedes to show sweet dried berries grape jam and a dusting of cocoa powder. Tasty.Finish Medium-short. The rancio note returns along with slightly bitter walnut and charcoal notes. The finish is must less sweet than the palate but retains the same essence. This fades quickly though leaving just a vague dusty grape-skin note.With Water A few drops of water initially mute the aroma. After a rest in the glass there’s a marked increase in alcohol bite and a lot less sweetness. Texture is unaffected but the palate is muddier and confused. Skip the water here.Overall At first this is a little more disappointing than I remember from when it was 12 years old. The port notes are nice but are accompanied by an uncomfortable musty character that I can’t quite shake. The Glenmorangie malt – always a bit of a wallflower – is totally subsumed by the port. On the upside the palate is well-rounded and satisfying with good depth of flavor. Luckily the disappointment fades as the bottle rests perhaps through oxidation or perhaps it’s shaking some bottle shock. Whatever the reason if you have an issue with your first glass – give it another try a week later or maybe even decant it to encourage the oxidation a little. Once my bottle and I came to an understanding I amended my review up to a “Recommended”.
219,Glenmorangie Signet - As much as I complain about the difficulty of obtaining tasting samples for a wide variety of Scotches few experiences can compare with spotting a bottle of something truly special while patronizing an unfamiliar bar or restaurant. While in Massachusetts recently I happened to notice a bottle of Glenmorangie Signet sequestered among the almost-forgotten-about denizens of the highest shelf. Almost too dark to see I recognized the logo on the label from blog posts of richer-than-me (or luckier?) whisky tasters. This stuff runs $200 a bottle so I tentatively asked the bartender for the price of a pour. He had to look it up $25. Normally I would scoff and walk out the door but the Signet called to me. My friends were preparing to leave so I cast a last longing glance at the nearly-full bottle of ambrosia and reluctantly left.The next day I had an opportunity to pop back in to the same bar after a lengthy day of work-related meetings. I had been thinking about that Signet all afternoon. Bottled without chill-filtering at 46% ABV this is a vatting of older Glenmorangie about 80% of it between the ages of 30 and 35. A proportion (15-20%) of the barley is a roasted ‘chocolate’ barley malt. The ‘chocolate’ term describes a process of roasting that produces a chocolate-like color and nutty flavors – it is often used in heavy dark beers like porter and stout; the chocolate malt whisky in the vatting is about 10 years old. The barrels are American white-oak previously containing bourbon although some small percentage of the vatting had aged in new oak barrels which Glenmorangie itself sources in Missouri’s Ozarks.Nose Bourbon-y vanilla and oak. Hint of lemon peel a little minty background. After opening up there are delectable notes of light roast coffee beans marshmallow and hazelnut butter.Palate Upfront there is a wave of milk chocolate butter and caramel. This evolves into a full mouth-coating vanilla in time round full-bodied and very well-integrated. The oak notes – the nutty ones – are big bold and melt perfectly with those chocolate-y malted cereal and caramel flavors. Hazelnut butter rounds out the palate. Super smooth and elegant. Amazing.Finish Long with mouth-drying oaky tannins. At the end a ghost of fresh berries.A few drops of water bring more chocolate on the nose. On the palate the water gives a tendril of raspberry without diminishing the rest.Overall This is undeniably an excellent dram. There are no flaws and the lack of any bitterness (despite all the oak) to the finish is impressive as is the sequence of nutty caramel coffee and chocolate flavors all detectable independently. The $200 price tag is a bit high especially considering the quality of Glenmorangie’s less-expensive offerings. If you want a big luscious special-occasion highlander and can handle the splurge you will not be disappointed. If not keep an eye out for a dram at a high-end bar. It’s an experience.
220,Glenmorangie The Duthac - Another day another Glenmo with an inscrutable name. Normally I do not have the opportunity to purchase Duty Free whisky a curse that comes with the blessing of not spending untold thousands of dollars on “exclusives” that by all accounts are not worth the effort. Today though I have a 45ml sample from Flaviar with (one of) the Glenmorangie’s Duty Free exclusives The Duthac. Let’s see if this one would be worth the international flight.The Duthac is named after the medieval St. Duthac and intended to honor the annual pilgrimage of King James IV to his shrine near the distillery in Tain. This contrived story is probably intended to justify the marketing phrase “A whisky fit for a king.” A king flying coach I suppose. The whisky is a no-age-statement (NAS) bottling of Glenmorangie partially finished in PX (Pedro Ximénez) sherry casks and part in charred virgin oak. The vatting is bottled at 43% ABV and sold in 1 liter bottles in Duty Free (aka “travel retail”) shops.Nose Light sweet and honeyed. Toasted nuts honeycomb and caramel dominate the aroma without much in the way of fruits or florals. A slight resinous tinge of raisin is the only hint of sherry that I get and a little bit of ripe banana which might be from the virgin oak.Palate Mildly syrupy body. Medium tongue burn (appropriate for 43% ABV). The overall impression is sweet with more obvious elements of sherry maturation golden raisin fig and date. A slight nutty background provides some contrast.Finish Medium length. Nutty malt without much dimension. No fruit and no evolution through the finish. Plain.With Water A few drops of water add an extra layer of banana to the aroma (no thanks) and thin the palate. The finish is a little more complex with a high note of lime peel or tart berries. Still I’d avoid the water with this one.Overall This seems like a slightly older Lasanta with some of the rough edges sawn off but nothing of value added. For the price I’d rather buy something that isn’t narrowly beating a $40 whisky. Especially if it means I can stay away from the airport.
221,Glenmorangie The Original (10 year) - Despite reviewing just … about … every … recent … Glenmorangie … bottling (and mostly loved them all) I’ve somehow managed to miss the most basic one. To rectify that I’ve turned my admittedly biased palate to Glenmorangie’s baseline expression the 10 year “Original” which retails for around $36 near me up from $29 only a year ago.The Original is aged for 10 years in only ex-bourbon casks both first- and second-fill and includes some of the “Designer” oak that was sourced by Glenmorangie wood management in the Ozark mountains of Missouri explicitly for the purpose of turning into barrels sloshing some bourbon in and then getting to the real business of aging Glenmorangie. Although this is not stated outright it’s likely that this is the same whisky aged further that ends up in Glenmorangie’s cask-finished expressions. We thus get to experience it here naked minus cask embellishment.Nose The initial impression similar to malts from The Balvenie is a slightly citrusy honey with tones of light caramel. Some nondescript floral character and piercingly young fruit (green pears tart grapes etc.). Deeper examination yields a slightly unpleasant antiseptic note which it should be remembered seems to vanish in slightly older (or aggressively cask-finished) Glenmorangie malts.Palate Medium bodied. A solid butterscotch foundation with some slightly bitter barrel tannins and more antiseptic. Nothing is built on that foundation however.Finish Of medium length with an unfortunate echo of both the rubbing alcohol and the bitter oak notes leading the way. A slathering of vanilla frosting and a ghost of bitter herbs.With Water Water as usual amps the floral notes in the nose revealing rosewater. It brings a hint of orange peel to the palate and rounds off a few of the rougher edges. I urge the use of water with this one – it patches up a lot of the holes.Overall Despite my adoration for older Glenmorangies I have a hard time loving The Original. While its price must be considered – it’s hard to find decent competition for a $35 single malt – this particular bottle hits two of my three least favorite whisky characteristics bitterness and “rough” rubbing alcohol (luckily it doesn’t have any of that ‘rotten banana’ aroma that I despise). The nose is noteworthy – showing a lot of promise with honey florals and a hint of that Glenmorangie elegance but it gets shaky on the tongue and then all falls apart on the finish. Luckily a dash of water improves the malt to the point that I’m interested in a second glass.If you’re considering a purchase I would say this falls short of both The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 (an extra $10) and Glenmorangie’s own cask finishes (an extra $12 to $20). It might be however a slight improvement over the cheaper Glenlivet 12 and Glenfiddich 12 especially if you’re not sensitive to bitter notes in whisky. My rating might seem harsh but I just can’t recommend a whisky I disliked this much. Don’t let that dissuade you though… go find a glass somewhere and see if I’m wrong.
222,Glenmorangie Tùsail - Tùsail like previous annual Private Editions from Glenmorangie (Companta Finealta Artein and Ealanta) explores some aspect of whiskymaking by highlighting a particular ingredient or process. Tùsail was made from a batch of floor-malted (by hand) Marris Otter winter barley distilled and aged for an unspecified length of time in ex-bourbon casks. It was bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration and retailed for $99 (it’s probably all sold out by now).Marris Otter a nearly-forgotten strain of hardy winter barley prized by brewers in England was saved from the oblivion of failing to compete with high-yield agricultural strains by a pair of British seed merchants. Dr. Bill Lumsden Glenmorangie’s director of distilling acquired a batch and set about seeing what kind of whisky it would make. There are no records of Marris Otter being used by whisky distilleries in the past although it’s certainly possible that Lumsden wasn’t the first.Nose Clove-studded baked apples. Graham cracker and dried ginger. Oatmeal cookie dough.Palate Pumpkin pie. Cinnamon and sugar. Root beer. The flavors are all very autumnal and remind me of falling leaves and comforting homemade Fall baked goods. Beyond that there is something industrial tasting like the oil/glue notes found in Springbank and Redbreast.Finish Medium-short. Slightly nutty with hazelnuts and echoes of the cinnamon and clove spice notes. Fades with dusty hay and dried coconut.With Water A few drops of water bring out more fruit notes – apple cider poached pears and wildflower honey and add more spice and brighter alcohol on the palate. I recommend a very little water with this one.Overall A very well-made but ultimately uninteresting dram. The Autumn flavors and aromas are nice but seem like just variations on the standard “barley” grain flavors that trigger some kind of taste or smell memory from my youth. The attempt to showcase the Marris Otter barley by stripping away other flavors (using only ex-bourbon casks and particularly light ones at that) has produced an introspective examination of the barley strain’s personality that like an educational show on TV doesn’t elicit much excitement. It’s a nice whisky and very pleasant to drink but plenty of cheaper malts can claim the same.I can’t recommend this for the full retail $99 but if you’re curious about a rare (maybe unique) barley’s effect on the whiskymaking process or prefer subtle grain-driven drams without much cask influence then this one is right up your alley.
223,Glenturret (10 year) - The Glenturret distillery is probably best known as the site of the Famous Grouse Experience a tourist attraction and visitor center for blended scotch The Famous Grouse. Both the brand and the distillery are owned by Highland Distillers (The Edrington Group) which also owns The Macallan and Highland Park. The vast majority of the Glenturret distillery’s single malt output goes into various Grouse blends although it has also been bottled as a single malt for some time. The brand seems to be going through a sort of re-imagining as the previous age-stated malts are missing from shelves replaced instead by NAS bottlings of sherry- peat- and triple wood focused expressions. A new 10 year-old is said to be launching soon.This review is of the slightly older 10 year-old (ex-bourbon casks) from a sample bottled in 2014 before it was temporarily discontinued. The 10 year-old in turn replaced the previous 12 year-old edition.If you’re wondering why I’m spending blog space on a discontinued mediocre single-malt including little in the way of details and writing very little preamble… that’s because I’m writing this while getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner which I (mainly) cook. That means I don’t have time for you people. Sorry. If you’re wondering what I will be drinking post-turkey the answer is Powers John Lane. Review upcoming!Nose Highland with nose-crinkling oils and a sooty earthy fungal note (mild peat perhaps from the water). Apricot pits woody caramels and lemon curd.Palate Syrupy body. Sweet with some honey and butterscotch up front. Minimal tongue burn. Cereal grains show through tasting like puffed-barley breakfast cereal. Mild oak. Little fruit.Finish Medium length. Fruit more noticeable here like apricot jam. A hint of soot and some drying oaky tannins. Fades without bitterness.With Water A very few drops of water seems to heavily mute the aroma replacing it with a very faint nuttiness. The palate is also muted while the finish pops with acidic lemon and more fruit. I wouldn’t bother with water here although the change to the finish is notable.Overall A very tasty whisky with no glaring flaws. As is often the case with single malts aged for middling amounts of time in only ex-bourbon casks the flavors are consistent and only mildly interesting. I hesitate to say “forgettable”. The mild peat notes are interesting but really just end up dirtying the fruits and cereals. I’m holding out for the re-launch of the 10 year in hopes that it will represent better wood management or cask selection or perhaps a combination of barrel types.
224,Gooderham & Worts Four Grain Canadian Whisky - Oh it’s Father’s Day today which makes me a bad blogger. Everyone else with their head in the proverbial game is posting Top 10 lists of Gifts for Dad and promoting Father’s Day sales and giveaways and subscriptions. I find the “Influencer” rat race very tiresome and that makes me doubly happy to not consider myself amongst their ilk. I just post reviews and try to keep to a schedule. Once in awhile I post some rambling thoughts. I don’t even know how many Twitter followers I have. What’s Instagram?On to this week’s review which unfortunately brings me a certain degree of sadness. I was hyped by the release of Lot 40 Canadian Rye back in the day which to me heralded a new age of quality Canadian whisky finally being exported to the States. I was therefore waiting with bated breath for the distiller of Lot 40 Corby Spirits to re-release another classic Canadian whisky Gooderham & Worts. Then the day finally came and… it’s just not very good. Pair this disappointment with my uhm… less-than-stellar review of sibling Pike Creek (Port Finish) and there’s only one conclusion to make Canadian whisky revolution cancelled. Return the fireworks and fire the band.The original G&H was a large Toronto distiller established in 1832. By 1926 it was the largest producer of Canadian whisky and the then-owner bought the second largest Canadian distillery which was Hiram Walker. The G&H facility functioned as a Hiram Walker plant until it was closed for good in 1990. The eponymous brand was re-released by current Hiram Walker owner Pernod Ricard in 2015 and is now distilled by Corby Spirits (which is mostly owned by Pernod Ricard) in Windsor Ontario. In traditional Canadian style the four grains that go into G&H (rye wheat barley and corn) are distilled separately on column stills (and some also on pot stills) and aged separately in a combination of virgin oak (the vast majority) and ex-bourbon cooperage until they are blended together to form the final product which is bottled at 44.4% ABV. Age? No information available on that. It has to be at least 3 years old to be called Canadian Whisky.My bottle says Blend No. A.A1129 on it. It retails for around $35 which is only about 5 bucks less than Lot 40 which is seriously better in every single way.Nose Spicy but in a cloyingly sweet way (like cinnamon and cardamom in syrup). Corn syrup… maple syrup… all the syrups. The grain profiles seem to be buried under four to five layers of treacly heavy sweetness although some notes of sweet corn green apple and lemon peel peek through like shipwrecked sailors drowning in an ocean of corn syrup.Palate Medium bodied with a very low gentle tongue burn. Again the first impression is one of spice while all of the following flavors are syrup and candy and sweetness. A bit of dried cinnamon and clove and a hint of acetone near the end alas.Finish Short. The acetone appears quickly and is paired with a slightly bitter or astringent charcoal note. The sweetness seems to have ended but there also doesn’t appear to be much underneath it. Fades quickly.With Water Several drops of water initially wash out the aroma and increase the nose tickle. After a rest in the glass there might be an extra green pear note. The palate seems unchanged. Water optional but I don’t think it helps.Overall I’m pretty disappointed. I expected something closer to Lot 40 or maybe Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye which are simple but effective and well-rounded drinks. This dram is all elbows an awkward combination of too-sweet and too-simple with lonely hints of incomplete spice and grain flavors. This already-messy formula is then marred by acetone (paint thinner) notes at the end of the palate and in the finish which is far too short.As it’s thoroughly outshone by both its slightly-more-expensive sibling Lot 40 and its cheaper competition Crown Royal Northern Harvest I cannot recommend this. Look for either of those instead.
225,Gordon & MacPhail: Mortlach (15 year) - I first tried this independently bottled Mortlach at Whiskies of the World Expo last year and made a note about how much I enjoyed it. I sought out a bottle and found one at Caskers.com for $80. That’s more than I’d usually spend on an unknown quantity but having tried it at the show I knew it was worth the scratch. How’s that for a case study in how tastings lead to sales whisky industry?Mortlach is an unusual distillery. Like Springbank it has a unique and convoluted distillation process that involves “partial triple distillation” or “2.7 times distillation” which I won’t even try to describe here. Mortlach has six stills of vastly different types and sizes and has been around since 1823 (and a major component in the Johnnie Walker blends since 1923). Owned by Diageo it has not had much of a presence in the single-malt scene aside from one-offs from independents (like this one) or special releases from Diageo. Until last year that is when Diageo announced new packaging and a corresponding new brand strategy for Mortlach single malt aiming at the premium market. The entry-level “Rare Old” expression with no age statement is more than $100 (!!!) a bottle when you can find it in the US. Yikes.That’s bad news for me because I love Mortlach’s house character. When aged in sherry as it often is it becomes a mysterious amalgamation of sweet and savory. Think pineapple on pizza brown sugar in jerky or barbecue glaze on ribs. It’s considered “beefy” and has given heft and texture to blends for almost two centuries but stands on its own as a luscious and satisfying dram. This Gordon & MacPhail bottling at 15 years of age is from a refill sherry cask and bottled at 43% ABV.Nose Meaty dried figs sweet fresh hay and something savory like a soy sauce glaze on short ribs. Elegant and robust although none of the aromas are overdone. Unmistakably sherried but not a “sherry bomb”. A slight smoky vegetal note arises after a rest in the glass – smouldering wet leaves – although the effect is not strong enough to call it peat.Palate Heavy bodied – almost oily. Like the aroma the flavor balances sweet and savory with jam and cooked fruit flavors marrying with toasted oats and buttery oak. The effect on the tongue is heavy slightly sweet and complex.Finish Medium-long and warming. Stewed plums coffee cake and wet hay. Not bitter.With Water A few drops of water seem to bring out a weird vegetable aroma – almost like celery. Weird. Certainly experiment with a little water once you reach the bottom of your glass but otherwise there’s no need for water here.Overall A stately refined example of sherried Mortlach. Something about this distillery speaks of the Scotland of yore. Having never experienced the Scotland of yore I can only assume it’s the combination of excellent sherry casks with the meaty oily rough-around-the-edges malt of Mortlach that gives me the impression. Mortlach is a necessary education for any lover of scotch and the 15 year-old available currently from Gordon & MacPhail is a fine tutelage especially considering that the alternative is the official bottling at $110!
226,Grant’s 12 year-old Blended Scotch - Some of you may have missed the overlooked news last April that Master of Malt (I will not dignify them with a link) sold out – in all meanings of that phrase – to multinational conglomerate AB InBev. If you don’t recognize that company name it’s the parent company of Anheuser-Busch. That’s right. Budweiser. I mostly ignored the news myself as corporate takeovers are the norm in the alcohol business. Then I learned recently from a reader that Master of Malt has ceased shipments to the United States. No more whisky advent calendars no more 30ml Drinks by the Dram samples (which this website essentially runs on like gas) and no more Boutique-y Whisky Company independent bottles for US customers. Why would they do such a thing you ask? Their official blog on the topic is full of apologies and vagaries but reading between the lines the answer is clear AB InBev is a major US distributor of alcohol and spirits distributors cannot also be spirits retailers in the US due to the antiquated post-Prohibition liquor laws known as the “Three-Tier System”. Suffice it to say that unless AB InBev spins off and sells the Master of Malt retail site or forms a partnership with another retailer to handle US purchases they won’t be renewing shipments to the US any time soon.Master of Malt is dead to me long live The Whisky Exchange (often abbreviated TWE). Luckily for me and this site TWE full-on copied Master of Malt and now offers a range of 30ml samples. Phew!In the meantime I have about a gallon’s worth of Master of Malt samples to go through. Sometimes they don’t even make sense. Like this one Grant’s 12 year-old blended scotch (not to be confused with Glen Grant 12 year-old single malt) is discontinued and has been for awhile. Grant’s Family Reserve (NAS) is now the flagship blend from William Grant & Sons and the fourth best-selling blended scotch in the world. Following the industry-wide pattern Grant’s did away with those troublesome age statements in favor of (no doubt) being able to dump younger whisky into the vat. That’s a bit of an exaggeration as Grant’s still sells 8-year 18-year and 25-year blends.Grant’s whiskies contain grain from the Girvan distillery as well as malt from William Grant & Sons -owned distilleries Glenfiddich Balvenie Kininvie and Aisla Bay as well as bulk malt from the wider market (apparently up to 25 of them). The blend is bottled at 40% ABV. Since you’re not likely to find a bottle of this anywhere and it likely bears little resemblance to the Signature or Family Reserve blends I’m not sure why you’re even still reading this…Nose Orange peel honeyed malt. Sweet and bready like sugar cookie dough. Simple and doesn’t change in the glass.Palate Syrupy body. Sweet and simple but with some weight. Honey up front with a continuation of the cookie-dough theme. Slightly bitter citrus peels follow and a tinge of barrel char.Finish Short. Yeasty with a reprise of the palate notes plus a little cinnamon. Fades quickly without evolving.With Water A few drops of water open up a dusty spice cabinet with spent clove and dried-up ginger. The palate is however a little more complex and with a bit more spice. This doesn’t really need the water but isn’t hurt by it.Overall Unchallenging but enjoyable. A good “I don’t want to think about it too hard” kind of dram without any rough edges or unexpected twists. Sweeter than most other mid-aged blends but with less fruit. The Girvan grain component keeps its head down and does not contribute any off flavors or betray any youthful alcohol notes. Of course this is discontinued I would buy more if it weren’t. Similar in a lot of ways to Bank Note 5 year but with more finesse and more sweetness. Your best bet to find a replacement is to actually look at Monkey Shoulder which has the same Grant’s-owned malt components without the grain.
227,Great King Street “Artist’s Blend” - John Glaser the whiskymaking wizard behind Compass Box and creator of some of the finest blends and blended malts in the modern age of scotch has set himself a mission To bring good blended scotch whisky back to the masses. To that end Compass Box has launched a new brand – Great King Street after the street on which Compass Box is headquartered – and its first release is called “Artist’s Blend.”The blend contains just over 50% Lowland grain whisky aged in first-fill American oak barrels. The rest (just under half) is malt around 7% from Speyside and the rest from two northern Highland distilleries. It’s aged in a combination of 10% first-fill sherry butts 27.7% oak barrels fitted with new charred French oak ends (heads) and the rest in first-fill American (ex-bourbon) barrels. I love to see this kind of information made available by the whiskymaker – it shows that the whisky has nothing to hide and acknowledges that people might be curious about the content of their whisky. Oh and it’s $40.John referred to Artist’s Blend as “blended scotch for whisky geeks” at this year’s WhiskyFest although it also has much wider appeal. By starting with excellent well-aged Lowland grain whisky artfully blending it with a higher-than-normal proportion of malt and then bottling it at 43% ABV with no chill filtration or caramel coloring John has proven (to this blogger at least) that blends don’t have to play second-fiddle to single malts. As the website states “Due to the preponderance of poorly made inexpensive Blended Scotch Whiskies on the market many people assume any bottle of Scotch bearing the term ‘blended’ is somehow inferior.”I will admit to having that same bias myself. At the start of my whisky journey I quickly discovered that single malts were flavorful potent and exciting. The blends I tried in comparison were watery dull and cheap-tasting. Kudos to John for turning me around this juice is awesome and it makes me very optimistic about the future of blends. I hope he sells a ton of the stuff. My notes belowAppearance Super pale – the color of hay.Nose The grain is evident but there’s a fresh citrusy apricot note that wows. Dry hay elderflower (really!) and there might be a hint of dry mossy peat but only a hint. Some vanilla bean or vanilla ice cream. Custard. Soft subtle malt partially overshadowed by the sharper grain notes but it works. Buttercream frosting. Mmm.Palate Wow! Very creamy body. Creamsicle up front with waves of vanilla pudding or tapioca soft grain without undue alcohol burn apricot preserves marzipan… just wow. Confections unending and all tied together with that nice bright citrusy grain. Just great.Finish Medium length a little more bitterness than I usually like but it echoes with vanilla frosting and marzipan. On the very tail end green apple skins.Overall This is fantastic stuff for $40 a bottle. The grain lifts the blend up rather than thinning it out or watering it down. There is a clear delineation between the prominent notes; nothing is muddied or vague. The subtle perfumy nose and creamy flavorful palate make this an eye-opener.A few drops of water brings some green grass to the nose and makes the grain sharper. On the palate it adds some smoke revealing some meaty peat and charcoal. More wood tannins on the finish. I wouldn’t bother with the water just let it open up in the glass for 10 minutes instead. You could of course use this for cocktails – but I like it straight up. It’s that good.
228,Great King Street: Glasgow Blend - Anyone who reads this blog frequently will already be familiar with my love for Artist’s Blend from Great King Street (aka Compass Box). Imagine then my scrambling to request a sample when the new permanent addition to the Great King Street lineup was announced. Where Artist’s Blend is nuanced and light Glasgow Blend is intended to be robust and flavorful as befits the reputed taste of the residents of Glasgow Scotland. The flavor profile is built around both sherry and peat making it truly the polar opposite of its sister blend. This is an homage to blended scotch styles of the 19th century when nearly all malt whisky was peated (peat being the primary heat source for floor maltings at the time) and most of the available used cooperage was from sherry butts.The Glasgow Blend is formulated with (the specs are freely available online – I love Compass Box!) 33% Lowland grain whisky from the Cameronbridge distillery 20% single malt from a “south-shore Islay distllery” and the rest Clynelish a sherried malt from the Benrinnes distillery and a small proportion of other malts from Speyside and the Highlands. The Islay distillery is apparently Laphroaig according to a few Internet sources. Oh and some of that malt (probably some Clynelish) carries John Glaser’s signature new French oak finishing. Now that’s a spec sheet.The whisky is bottled at 43% ABV is not chill-filtered nor colored and retails for $45. 375ml half-bottles are also available. Thanks to Debbie and Chris at The Collective PR for the sample!Nose A whiff of peat greets the nose first – there’s no shying away from the peat in this blend. The peat is a little smoky and airily herbal but I can’t place it as Laphroaig Lagavulin or Ardbeg. Underlying the peat are wisps of fruit in the form of crushed berries and unripe figs. While it has more presence than Artist’s Blend I wouldn’t call the aroma robust. A rest in the glass brings out the vanilla buttercream that fans of Artist’s Blend will be looking for.Palate Deep earthy notes of tobacco and fruitwood smoke. A pleasantly creamy body without tongue burn and more wisps of fruit. Subtle but artful. The fruit is present but weaves into the peat effortlessly. Well played Mr. Glaser.Finish Medium length. The peat earthiness continues growing a little more smoky and allowing the fruit to drop away. As it fades there are hints of oak tannins and then the whole becomes mineral and dry.With Water A few drops of water tame the smoke and bring out a few soft cereal notes on the tongue. They also seem to chase away the fruit from the sherry. I don’t see the need for water with this one.Overall John Glaser continues to do what scotch blending companies have been advertising that they do for decades. He takes a components that are worth drinking on their own and crafts something with them that is truly impressive for under $50 a bottle. If you’ve ever tasted blended scotch and thought it needed more flavor or wished for some real peat presence in Johnnie Walker Black Label or sherry character and more drinkability in Black Bottle this is your blend. I believe I still prefer Artist’s Blend for its universal appeal and softer notes but the Glasglow Blend would definitely do a better job of heating up a highball. I’m particularly impressed with the interplay of sherry notes (which are fleeting) with peat notes (which are understated but dominant) without the two ever conflicting. I’ve had $80 peated malts finished in sherry casks that didn’t integrate half as well.
229,Green Spot Château Léoville-Barton Irish Whiskey - Midleton makers of Green Spot Yellow Spot Redbreast Jameson and basically most Irish whisky on the market has fully embraced the recent trend in releasing limited edition whiskies with matching limited edition price tags. Gone are the days when producers would take an entry-level whisky (say Glenmorangie 10) and finish it in a wine or fortified wine cask (say Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban) and release it for a few extra bucks. Now they take that whisky and dunk it in a wine cask and release a limited number of bottles for oh say $100.Okay I’m being a little unfair. This stuff is clearly of a higher caliber than the finished Glenmorangies and Green Spot isn’t cheap to start with. Nor presumably are empty grand cru Bordeaux barrels from Château Léoville-Barton (for reference wine from Léoville-Barton runs $30+ per bottle). Midleton has taken the classic Green Spot and aged it for an additional 1 to 2 years in the French oak Bordeaux casks before bottling at 46% ABV.Now I’ve had a rough history with whiskies finished in fresh red wine casks (as opposed to fortified wines like sherry madeira or port). To me they generally yield an acerbic tannic and sour note to the whisky. I was relieved to read positive reviews of this one however and decided to spring for a bottle as a treat to myself. I’m a big fan of the giving of treats to oneself.Nose A duality of bright fresh bursting red berries and intense cooked stonefruit jam. Light and airy but with a strong foundation of malt and pot-still barley notes (like oatmeal cookies). Sweet coconut cream. Delectable.Palate Soft and creamy. A bit of tongue burn. Soft grains malt toffee and blonde fudge with a drizzle of blackberry coulis.Finish Sweet and dessert-y more coconut cream (filling) raspberry jam and vanilla bean ice cream.With Water A few drops of water reveal some sherry notes – fig and fruitcake – as well as an almost Sauternes-like honeyed grape aroma. Water does not go amiss here but don’t be heavy-handed lest you drown out some of the more delicate flavors.Overall Unlike Redbreast Green Spot focuses on the lighter and sweeter aspects of pot-still whiskey. With the influence of French oak and French Bordeaux it becomes both ethereal and potently fruity like an expensive dessert at a high-end restaurant. I’m also very impressed by the total lack of those “red wine finish” notes that I’ve abhorred in other fresh wine-finished whiskies. Perhaps the already partially-sherried nature of Green Spot eased the transition to red wine.This is something special to finish off a special dinner and is actually worth its exorbitant price tag. That’s something I don’t say often.
230,Green Spot Irish Whiskey - Green Spot is one of the few surviving “bonded” Irish whiskeys – made by the ubiquitous Irish Distillers Limited (originally at the Jameson Bow Street Distillery and now at the larger facility in Midleton where all IDL whiskeys are made) – but sold by the wine merchants Mitchell & Son of Dublin Ireland. Originating sometime after Mitchell & Son began selling whiskey in 1887 ‘Green Spot’ refers to the family tradition of marking barrels of maturing whisky with a daub of paint to indicate their age – originally the shop sold Green Yellow Red and Blue Spot whiskeys most aged in the shop’s excess fortified wine barrels.Today only the green one remains of the line (although a 12 year-old Yellow Spot aged in three types of casks has recently returned to the European market). Green Spot is a single pot still Irish whiskey meaning a combination of malted and unmalted barley is distilled together (triple-distlled in this case) in a copper pot still like Redbreast which is also produced at the Midleton distillery by IDL. Unlike most Irish Whiskeys single pot still whiskies do not contain any column-still grain whiskey making this style analogous to (but not the same as) single-malt. Green Spot is then aged in 75% American oak ex-bourbon barrels and 25% in sherry casks for 8-9 years although it bears no age statement. It is likely caramel colored chill-filtered and bottled at 40% ABV.It was re-packaged circa 2011 when IDL acquired the license to distribute Green Spot outside of Ireland (although IDL has not yet announced plans to ship to the United States there are rumblings). Despite IDL’s claims that only the packaging has changed and not the whiskey consensus online is that the newer one is lighter in style and could be younger than the “old” bottling. Without a sample of old Green Spot to compare I cannot comment. Below are notes from my tasting of the “new” repackaged Green Spot from a 700ml bottle that I bought online via UK retailer Master of Malt.Nose Clearly sherried. Orange peel and candied ginger. Tangy and somewhat herbal. Green pear and cotton candy. Honey-lemon throat lozenges. After a rest in the glass there is a fibrous fruitiness like the skin of a red delicious apple. Even further in is a faint whiff of the nutty coconut I associate with bourbon-matured pot still whiskey.Palate Unctuous body – mouth coating. Minimal burn. Spicy ginger apple cider and nondescript grain.Finish Medium length the honey and lemon lozenge remains behind as the spicy notes fade. No trace of bitterness. Simple and refreshing.With Water A splash of water reveals bright fresh green banana on the nose really washes out the palate and adds a little peanut butter note to the finish. I wouldn’t recommend the water for how it affects the body. At 40% ABV it hardly needs further dilution.Overall While it has the same mouth-filling unctuousness as Redbreast the sherry notes seem to cover up the nutty/oily notes I associate with single pot still whiskey. There seems to be a lot of depth here but it’s hidden by a layer of simplicity. One must really search for the complexity. Still it is tasty and unique nobody else makes a sherry-matured Irish single pot still.With Redbreast’s popularity and the distinct lack of competition in the market for single pot still Irish whiskey I imagine that IDL is looking very hard at ramping production and distribution of Green Spot and that they intend to address the US market at some point. With its lighter style (closer in fact to the very popular Jameson) and the surge of interest in single pot still I think this would be a killer product in the US right now.Note I don’t usually do this but I feel that Green Spot warrants a second look. I feel there is more to discover so I will be updating these tasting notes and possibly my conclusion sometime this week – watch this space.
231,Greenore (8 year) Single-Grain Irish Whiskey - After all of the industry shake-ups in the last few years in Ireland it’s hard to tell who owns who and what they make now. Cooley Distillery founded by John Teeling in 1987 making it the only independent distillery in Ireland. Then in December 2011 the company was sold to Beam Inc. which was later bought by Suntory. Then when the old Kilbeggan Distillery began renovations Cooley’s name was changed to the Kilbeggan Distilling Company although the distillery facility itself kept the Cooley name. So that means that Beam-Suntory’s Kilbeggan Distilling Company produces Greenore (and other previous Cooley brands) at its Cooley Distillery location. Got it? Great!Greenore made waves when it was first released and single-handedly made a name for single-grain whiskey in a market dominated by blends and single malts. Made from a mashbill of 95% corn and 5% malted barley (for enzymes) Greenore is sold in a range of ages with the 8-year being the most widely available. The whiskey is aged in ex-bourbon casks and bottled at 40% ABV. My sample came from my Flaviar Welcome Pack (although current Welcome Packs no longer include it). The sample was collected from a bottle in December 2014.Nose Heavy grain notes – hay white glue industrial solvent (paint thinner). Some faint notes of vanilla and sugar cookies. After a lengthy rest in the glass the weird notes are partially covered up by sweeter ones… now it’s sweet glue sweet paint thinner etc.Palate Syrupy body. Mild caramel heavy dried coconut and coconut water more industrial glues.Finish Short. Faintly sweet with a lot more vanilla and some honeyed notes. No bitterness or really any oak tannins to speak of.With Water A few drops of water have no noticeable effect. I would skip the water especially at the anemic bottling strength of 40% ABV.Overall It’s hard to get past that paint thinner on the nose but once you do the experience is like a milder subtler simpler Redbreast 12 especially with those strong coconut flavors. Still I wouldn’t recommend this as an introduction to any type of spirits (even single grains). Order a glass at a bar if you want some education in why grain whisky needs more time in the barrel than malt does.
232,Hancock’s President’s Reserve - The label on this squat bottle of bourbon looks like it was created before anyone in the market started caring about the contents of their bottles. It informs me that the liquid is from a single barrel without giving a bottle number barrel identifier date year or even batch number. It also reveals that it is bottled at the very random 44.45% ABV and that it was distilled by Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort Kentucky. Aaaaaand… that’s it. Straight Bourbon? Guess not. There isn’t even a whimsical story about Hancock’s secret recipe blah blah which is I suppose a bit of a blessing.To the Internet! Hancock’s is made using Buffalo Trace’s Mashbill #2 which is high-ish-rye (12% or so rye undisclosed) and which is best known as the mashbill for Blanton’s. Hancock’s President’s Reserve is named after Hancock Lee who cofounded Leesburg Kentucky and who has no apparent historical tie to bourbon at all. Oddly Buffalo Trace doesn’t acknowledge the existence of this product on their website despite it regularly going out of stock at the few places that carry it. I was lucky to pick up a bottle for $45 before it sold out here and I’ve seen it advertised for around $50. If you see it significantly higher than that – avoid it… the store is gouging because of its relative rarity.Of course as this is a single-barrel bourbon without any distinguishing marks on it your next bottle could easily come from a different barrel altogether and be altogether different. Where there’s risk there’s reward! (Sometimes.)Nose Meltingly sumptuous fruit notes of mango sorbet kiwi and Red Delicious apples. Floral notes of honeysuckle and damnit-I-don’t-know-flowers-but-they’re-in-there. Clover honey fresh hay and a hint of marzipan. The aroma keeps evolving as I nose it. Now coconut cream pie now plum wine now pineapple juice. Wow.Palate Thin body. Mai Tai (high-end fruit punch I guess?) fresh banana and black tea precede a mild to moderate tongue burn. Which – I expected more! – doesn’t seem to evolve much on the tongue.Finish Long. Lemon verbena tobacco leaf slightly bitter barrel char pencil shavings (oh God I sound like a wine snob) and corn pudding. The finish doesn’t evolve much but it does definitely linger.With Water Several drops of water wake up some extra fruit notes of tropical persuasion. I dunno… passion fruit? The palate is a little livelier the finish fruitier. I’d definitely recommend trying this with some water after a few sips neat.Overall Excellent. I didn’t know what it was at the time I tasted but damn is it tasty. The aroma – especially – goes on for days and makes this some of the tightest-packed fruit-forward bourbon I’ve ever smelled. For $45 this is an experience that is not worth passing over. If you can find it and you already like bourbon get it. It’s really not like anything else I’ve had even from Buffalo Trace. If you can’t find it don’t fret – another batch will be along eventually… just don’t pay $120 for it online. It’s not worth that.
233,Hankey Bannister Original Blended Scotch - There’s something I like about a little miniature bottle of a cheap blended scotch. It has so much promise. Might this be the next old-school gem from the days when blended scotch was what everyone drank? Has this one stood the test of time and resisted the stultifying effects of a whisky market gone insane? Maybe I’ll find a new favorite value bottle that I can mix or sip with impunity.…and then I open it and I find more or less the same thing. Too much grain. too little flavor. Sigh.Hankey Bannister is produced by Inver House Distillers owners of Balblair Old Pulteney Speyburn Balmenach and anCnoc. The blend not surprisingly contains malt from all of these distilleries although other details are scarce. The line includes some weighty products with age statements of 12 21 25 and 40 years but I only have a miniature of the Original non-age-statement blend. Also while the name sounds like a silly British play on words it’s in fact a conjugation of the names of the brand’s founders Beaumont Hankey and Hugh Bannister.Nose Light grain lemon peel and a heavy dose of grain neutral spirit (vodka).Palate Nice creamy mouthfeel. A Glenkinchie-like lemon pervades the flavor and isn’t much balanced by anything including the continuing vodka notes.Finish Short. A slight marshmallow sweetness lemon candy and vodka. Finishes with – you guessed it – vodka.With Water A few drops of water heighten the citrus notes – adding grapefruit notably – but do little on the tongue or finish. Water neither hurts nor helps.Overall Some part of me thought that a little-known (in the States) homestyle blend might carry with it a cure for the common blend perhaps carrying the Old World love of blended scotch into the modern age. Alas this is brown vodka in the worst sense with entirely too much “light whisky” – practically grain neutral spirit or vodka – without nearly enough flavorful malt to fill it out. The only things it has going for it aside from the silly British name is a bumped ABV and some pleasant lemon notes.For once I can’t blame the plastic miniature bottle (this one is glass).
234,Hart Brothers Laphroaig 18 year - One of the reasons I sometimes avoid “tastings” – especially for wine – that I see advertised online or posted in restaurants… is that I don’t know what to expect. Are they going to charge me an arm and a leg? Is there a catch cutoff or are they going to try to sell me something? Is some bimbo at the hostess stand going to stare dumbfounded at me when I ask where to sit for the tasting? (That’s happened to me before.) For good whisky poured at cost though I thought I’d take the risk and drive up to Redwood City during rush hour on Tuesday.Here’s how it works. Martin’s West is a ‘gastropub’ (gourmet bar food and upscale beverages) in Redwood City CA. Tuesday nights at 6 pm the bartenders or waiters will (when asked) pour a 1 oz dram of the night’s bottle – supplied by David Driscoll from K&L Wines and Spirits down the street. They use Glencairn glasses. The charge will be the cost of the bottle divided by the number of pours (around 25). So for the $130 Hart Bros. Laphroaig 18 pours were $5. You can order as many pours as you like until they run out (but don’t be greedy!) David will hang out near the bar and answer questions if you have them. While you’re there Martin’s West has a very respectable whisky selection (pours of Pappy Van Winkle 15 bourbon for $16? Not bad.) and the food looks delectable. I will be going back to try out the food.I’m told K&L also runs a similar event at 530 PM on Thursday nights out of their San Francisco location at another local bar – Gitane.To stay up to date on these tastings (and find out in advance what he’ll be pouring) and read David’s very interesting views on the Spirits world check out his blog.Here are my notes from the Laphroaig 18 bottled by Hart Brothers a Scottish independent bottler and blender. It is 46% ABV and not chill-filtered. Distilled 1990.Nose Hello! It’s Laphroaig. Iodine seaspray and a big wave of smoky peaty goodness. Behind it lurks some light florals – elderflower? and green tea. Maybe a little touch of honey and green bananas. Mostly the salty peat though.Palate A little rough up front but resolving into trademark Laphroaig flavors of seaweed campfire and bright acidic peat.Finish Long and elegant and not as bitter as some peat monsters. Evolves out of the peat bog and into a little nuttiness -peanut? on the tail end.Overall Very similar to the distillery-bottled 18 in my opinion which is considerably cheaper. I don’t think I’d pay the $139 for this (compared to some other beauties in that price range). That said for $5 a pour at a walk-in tasting it was well worth the drive! Interesting that while this is more subtle and elegant than the distillery 10-year it’s not really much more complex nor does it show any increased wood influence. It’s just Laphroaig with some of the sharp edges sanded down.
235,Hazelburn (12 year) - Hazelburn is one of three brands produced by the Springbank distillery in Campbeltown on the southwestern coast of Scotland’s mainland. Once a major center of whisky production Campbeltown today only boasts three surviving distilleries. Springbank’s primary product (Springbank label) is two-and-a-half-ish-times distilled and mildly peated. Its Longrow malt is double-distilled and fully peated (it’s often compared to similar Islay malts). Hazelburn however is triple-distilled and unpeated. This makes it very similar to Lowlander Auchentoshan and a few Irish triple-distilled single malts and single pot still whiskies. The triple distillation yields a fruitier lighter-weight malt by stripping away some of the heavier alcohols.Hazelburn like the rest of Springbank’s lineup is not chill-filtered and has no added coloring. It is bottled at 46% ABV. Unfortunately Hazelburn 12 retails for $90 or so in the US (!!) apparently due to unusual markups from importers or distributors (see the comments below). If you’re interested in Hazelburn I suggest ordering from the UK as part of a large order (to spread the shipping cost across multiple bottles) and pay closer to $55 if you can find it in stock.Yes I lifted much of this prose from my Hazelburn 8-year review. Sue me it’s the holidays and I’m short on time.Nose White pepper honey and mild floral funkiness that almost smells like peat. The funky note is just potent enough to add complexity in the form of a floral spike and a citrus twist to an otherwise baseline malt profile honey caramel plain oak. A rest in the glass allows a pear note to develop.Palate Medium syrupy body. Delectable – a striking balance between green apple / lemon-lime tartness and oaky brown-sugar flecked sweet malt. The whole is underlain by a murky dusty complexity. A whisky to contemplate.Finish Medium-long. First piney floral notes give way to lemon zest and then not-quite-bitter oaky tannin. Not as lingering as a peated malt but also fades without bitterness.With Water A few drops of water amp up the vanilla notes adding a sweet “cream soda” element to both the aroma and palate. I suggest trying without water first and then witness the change that occurs with a few drops.Overall Whereas Hazelburn 8-year betrays its youth with grassy and acerbic notes and a lightness caused more by lack of development than the vaunted triple distillation (Redbreast is triple-distilled remember) Hazelburn 12 seems to have come into its own. It has funky oily notes that lovers of Springbank will know well but paired with honey and vanilla and pear instead of peat. A pleasant floral-forward malt with a deep complexity. No part of the whisky overwhelms and although Hazelburn is unpeated I would be unsurprised to find that some of the process water runs through peat bogs. That or Springbank’s hands-on whiskymaking process is responsible for some of those fungal/oily notes. If you’re not quite a peat fan but want something more from your 12 year-old single malt than the usual Speysiders can offer give Hazelburn a shot. The price in the US alone downgrades this from a “Must Try” to a “Recommended” but if you are able to get a bottle from the UK $55 is a very reasonable price.Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly. The distillery uses traditional worm tubs a cast-iron mash tun and employs mechanical ‘rummagers’ (to prevent a buildup of burnt deposits) in the copper stills which are heated with a combination of steam and direct oil fire. Springbank uses three stills to create a 2.8-time (not triple) distillation. Now hold on because this math is tricky The first “wash” distillation produces so-called “low wines” which are around 20% alcohol. A second distillation produces an intermediate distillate which is in the neighborhood of 35% alcohol. A third still is charged with a solution of 80% of this double-distillate and 20% of the “low wines” and a third distillation is performed. Thus in the final spirit around 80% of the volume has been triple-distilled while around 20% of the volume has been double-distilled. Hence 2.8x distillation. Phew! For a fantastic and in-depth guided tour of Springbank distillery be sure to check out Ralfy’s visit (scroll down).Springbank also makes Longrow (a peated malt) and (new in 2006) Hazelburn (unpeated truly triple-distilled). These along with the distillery’s flagship Springbank bottlings are all non-chill-filtered have no caramel coloring and are reduced to bottling strength on-site with the same water used to produce the whisky. The water like all Campbeltown whiskies comes from the Crosshill Loch in the hills above the town and is supplemented by a private well from a borehole drilled deep into the rock beneath the town. Note that the Springbank “CV” bottling which is at a similar price-point is purportedly a vatting of 6 8 and 12 year-old malts (unverified) from different barrel finishes.
236,Hazelburn (8 year) - Hazelburn is one of three brands produced by the Springbank distillery in Campbeltown on the southwestern coast of Scotland’s mainland. Once a major center of whisky production Campbeltown today only boasts three surviving distilleries. Springbank’s primary product (Springbank label) is two-and-a-half-times distilled and mildly peated. Its Longrow malt is double-distilled and fully peated (it’s often compared to similar Islay malts). Hazelburn however is triple-distilled and unpeated. This makes it very similar to Lowlander Auchentoshan and a few Irish triple-distilled single malts and single pot-still whiskies. The triple distillation yields a fruitier lighter-weight and (in this case at least) lighter-flavored malt. The basic 8-year is priced quite high for its age and for me occupies a no man’s land between affordability and cult appeal. If light whisky is your thing you owe it to yourself to splurge on one of the expressions of Hazelburn (they make a Sauternes-finished version that I have my eye on). If you like robust and fully-flavored malts steer clear.Hazelburn like the rest of Springbank’s lineup is not chill-filtered and has no added coloring. Note that Springbank’s higher-than-usual prices in the US are apparently due to importers or distributors and can be found for much more reasonable prices in the UK. If you’re interested in anything from Springbank I suggest trying to order it from the UK (make a large order to spread the shipping cost across multiple bottles).Nose White peach and vanilla. Very mild and soft elements of sugar cookie and white raspberry and a ghost of spearmint. Elegant and floral but not very complex.Palate Mildly creamy body with some high acidic notes of green fruits and dry white wine. Progresses into white chocolate and macadamia nuts.Finish A hint of Springbank style with a nutty oiliness that only emerges on the finish. Hazelnut skins vanilla bean and rice pudding. On the tail end a little bitterness.With Water A spare few drops of water bring out a little green apple skin in the nose but also up the octane of the alcohol vapors. Water adds a suggestion of … peat?! to the palate although it fades quickly. I would leave out the water.Overall Very light and unassuming. A bit like Auchentoshan but with nuttier flavors like hazelnut and white chocolate. Worth the price of a full bottle? Only if you’re crazy for the lighter style of triple-distilled whisky.Update 12/18/2017 Turns out 4 more years in oak makes a big difference for Hazelburn…Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly. The distillery uses traditional worm tubs a cast-iron mash tun and employs mechanical ‘rummagers’ (to prevent a buildup of burnt deposits) in the copper stills which are heated with a combination of steam and direct oil fire.

237,Henry McKenna Bourbon - I’ve actually reviewed Henry McKenna whiskey before – specifically a 10 year-old single-barrel release from K&L from way back in 2013 which I enjoyed. 10 year-old bourbon isn’t nearly as easy to find these days alas and those McKenna 10-year single barrel bottlings are now fetching $80 to $100 after one of the single barrels was named Best in Show at the 2019 SFWSC. Yeowch. So I thought I’d try the basic Henry McKenna Straight Bourbon to see if it lived up to its single barrel sibling. Of course there is no Henry McKenna distillery – the brand is owned by Heaven Hill distillers which distills and bottles a large number of brands including Elijah Craig Larceny and Evan Williams.In fact Henry McKenna is made from the same mashbill (75% corn 13% rye 12% barley) as Elijah Craig and Evan Williams. Bottles can be found for $15 or less and even 1-liter bottles are available in some markets for about the same. That’s some inexpensive whiskey even though it’s definitely younger and lower ABV (40%) than its cousin brands. The bottle doesn’t have an age statement and it’s Straight Bourbon which means it’s 4 years or older.Nose Fruit punch and/or tutti-frutti. Bubblegum. Some nose tickle but no paint thinner or rubbing alcohol notes. Light and one-dimensional.Palate Thin body. The fruit punch note returns on the palate along with some marshmallow bubble gum cotton candy and corn syrup.Finish Medium-short. Slight barrel char and a hint of menthol. Not bitter. Fades without evolving.With Water A few drops of water amplify the ‘fake’ fruit notes a bit which bodes well for mixability. The liquid is even thinner on the tongue but the finish has more vibrancy and more fruit. Water isn’t a bad idea with this one but certainly isn’t needed.Overall That fruit-punch note shows up in low-end bourbons including Jim Beam Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rebel Yell and McAfee’s Benchmark. Aside The interesting thing about that list is that they’re all made at different distilleries except for (probably) Rebel Yell which is a wheated mash bill. In other words “cheap fruit punch” is not a characteristic of a single distillery or mash bill but instead seems to affect whiskies in the lowest price range.Despite the common “light whiskey” profile in this price range this one holds together just fine. Don’t expect heavy bourbon flavors (oak spice) or any kind of power. This is just straightforward mixing bourbon without any major downsides except for its forgettable character. You could do way worse for $15 but I really suggest paying an extra $10 and getting something with more flavor. If $20 is your ceiling this isn’t a bad option.I marked it “Recommended” because it’s worth the money. If it were $30 a bottle it would be a solid “Avoid” so… there’s that.
238,Henry McKenna K&L Single Barrel (10 year) - This is a bit of an unfortunate review today. I often jump at the chance to get value whisky from K&L (as my regular readers know my favorite whisky retailer) when they get in single barrels and closeouts and so forth. This isn’t very useful for you all since this is a single barrel expression of Henry McKenna that is gone and isn’t coming back. There’s no point in me recommending it (or not) because you aren’t going to be able to buy it. However I paid $30 for it and damned if I’m not getting a blog post out of it. My hope is that if you see another single barrel of Henry McKenna on a shelf somewhere you might be inclined to pick it up (or not) based on my review. There that’s my rationalization and I’m sticking to it.A word about K&L. I think it’s very important to develop a relationship with your primary source for whisky. For many of you that may not be possible if that source is BevMo Costco another big-box retailer state-run liquor store or online retailer. Even then it might be worth getting to know their spirits buyer (by asking intelligent questions or making informed but humble suggestions) in person or via email. When you find someone in the industry whose tastes you can trust then it will be a lot easier to drop big bucks on a bottle you’ve never tasted based on their recommendation. That’s how I feel about David at K&L. If he thinks I’ll like it experience has shown that I probably will. I bought this ugly little bottle based on such a recommendation and because it was only $27. Value AND a recommendation from a trusted source? Sign me up!Henry McKenna Single Barrel is a Bottled-in-Bond 100-proof bourbon from Heaven Hill distillers. This same mashbill (corn with a small percentage – perhaps 10% – of rye and some malted barley) is used to create Elijah Craig and Evan Williams. I’m not usually fond of high-corn bourbon but here 10 years in an exceptional barrel turned an ordinary mid-level bourbon into something special. For reference this is Barrel #982 chosen by K&L Wine Merchants Distilled 10/8/2002. There is also a baseline expression of the Henry McKenna brand on shelves for not much money.By the way I meant it when I said it was an ugly bottle. It looks vaguely like a gradeschooler glued random bits of classroom materials onto the bottle. It’s got gobs of solidified glue dripping down from a useless bit of wound copper wire with a very unofficial-looking stamped copper tag proclaiming “Bottled in Bond” a slab of actual green felt and a flip-open booklet that serves double duty as the front label yet often hangs drunkenly open. Judge a book not by its cover…Nose Pecan pie heavy spices (cinnamon clove) and a hearty dose of cherry liqueur. After a rest in the glass there’s a yeasty bread note and apparent oak.Palate Sweet corn up front with a distinct woodiness – not unpleasant. Some initial burn but not too harsh for 100 proof. Cherry cola cough syrup and marzipan. A hint of bitter herbs.Finish Long. Sweet notes including the oak linger. At the tail end a suggestion of mint and charcoal. Slightly more bitterness than I like in the finish.With Water Water adds some perfume to the nose – the cherry becomes cherry blossoms – and the oak becomes sappier and sweeter. The palate also benefits from the water becoming a little better integrated and a bit more tart. Here’s a great example of a mediocre whiskey that blossoms into elegance with just the addition of H2O. I highly recommend dosing this with a few drops of water.Overall Cost $27 but drinks like a $45 bourbon. A hefty 100 proof gives weight and the rye-inflected standard bourbon notes are all accounted for and in the proper proportions. I could wish for a little more silkiness in the body and a bit more caramel and less charcoal in the wood notes but all around a decent workhorse whiskey. A few drops of water elevate it to a $55 bourbon. Did I mention it was $27?Note The rating below applies to Henry McKenna Single Barrel bottlings in general since this one is no longer available.
239,Hibiki (12 year) Japanese Whisky - I have not had the best of luck with Japanese whisky up to this point. I had read that the Japanese love of artistry obsessive technical prowess and passion for the Scottish style of whisky made for a confluence of whiskymaking excellence. However something about Yamazaki (Japan’s premiere single malt) and I don’t mix. Luckily I found what I was looking for in Hibiki 12. Ironically this is a blended whisky. Japan has a vibrant history of whisky blending. Much like in Scotland early market successes were inexpensive blended whiskies in a light style. Social drinking in Japan these days focuses on whisky highballs – cooling drinks made with blends or lighter malts mixed with ice and soda water – because Japan’s very hot and very humid climate demand a lighter style of whisky devoid of heavier (or peated) flavors.Hibiki 12 is a widely-acclaimed blend of 12 year-old (or greater) Japanese whisky from global giant Suntory. It includes malts from Yamazaki and Hakushu and grain from Chita distillery along with whiskies from several other Japanese distilleries. The components are aged in a variety of casks including ex-bourbon ex-sherry and casks that once held Umeshu a plum liqueur (making Hibiki 12 unique as this bottling is the only Suntory product with malt aged in Umeshu casks). The vatting of these whiskies is then filtered through bamboo charcoal and bottled at 43% ABV.Nose Orange peel and some very aromatic florals (cherry blossom?). The grain component is soft and yeasty and an altogether foreign aroma pervades – this is when I race to my computer to learn this whisky is partially matured in plum liqueur casks. That explains it – now I can’t get plum sauce out of my nostrils. At any rate it’s all very well-balanced and artful.Palate Not as creamy as expected but the grain is soft and there is a pillowy texture to it. Light malt light wood (marshmallow) and a teasing bright acidic young fruitiness. The little bit of oak present here is nothing more than a frame for holding the canvas of grain on which these flavors are painted. Woah apparently Japanese whisky makes me wax poetic. Did I already talk about cherry blossoms?Finish There’s the plum again and the grain whisky yields to some really nice steamed bun and buttered scone flavors. The finish is quite short leaving behind only a minerally taste – like good spring water. Very clean and crisp.With Water A few drops of water makes the nose somewhat more cereally. However it really makes the fruit notes dance on the tongue – lots of fresh acidity and green fruits appear. This dram is definitely well-served by a small (SMALL) addition of water.Overall For me this dances circles around every Yamazaki single malt I’ve had even the 18. Where Yamazaki seems to be all about heat and banana (its effect on me is very similar to that of younger Amrut whiskies) this is elegant and poised with high-contrast flavors rising out of a mild subtle background of impeccable grain. The plum liqueur cask’s effect is profound yet not at all overpowering and makes the dram refreshingly unique. For what it’s worth I liked this one so much that I stopped in the middle of writing this post to go order a bottle. I believe that’s the first time I’ve ever done such a thing. That makes it a “Must Have” since apparently I “must have” it enough to order it on the spot. While this whisky is particularly good in cocktails highballs or just with soda water and/or ice. I think it’s 100% good enough to sip and savor straight up. That said the first thing I’ll be doing with my bottle of Hibiki 12 is mixing up a Japanese whisky highball!If you’ve been holding back from trying Japanese whisky I suggest starting with this one instead of Yamazaki. It’s not cheap (I paid $65 for a very attractive 750ml bottle) but don’t let the fact that it’s a blend deter you from paying for it.
240,High West Double Rye! (New Recipe) - I have been remiss on this blog in my (total lack of) coverage of High West’s excellent whiskies. I think some part of my brain decided that the celebrated Utah blender/bottler (and now distiller) got plenty of attention from other blogs and media outlets and thus didn’t need any from me. That’s a lame justification and I plan to review more High West whiskies in the future starting today with High West’s Double Rye! Yes the exclamation point is indeed part of the whiskey’s name. I’m not quite sure how you’re supposed to pronounce it. Are you expected to yell it? Or perhaps emphasize the ‘Rye!’ part such that people wonder if you have a condition. “Here you go a nice glass of Double RYE!” I’m a hit at parties.Double Rye! is a blend of straight ryes. This means the bottle itself cannot be called a straight rye. Aren’t legal definitions fun? The ryes in question are a 95% rye (5% malted barley) mash bill from MGP and an 80% rye (20% malted rye) distilled by High West themselves at their new-ish distillery in Park City Utah. The MGP rye is younger (at least 2 years of age) and column-distilled. The High West portion is older (a house blend containing High West straight ryes between 4 and 7 years) and is distilled on a copper pot still. Both ryes are aged in new charred American oak. The ratio of the two components is a secret but we do know that the older High West component is in the minority. The whiskey is not chill-filtered (nor carbon filtered) and is bottled at 46% ABV. My bottle is from Batch 18G26.In an interesting departure from the usual startup distillery business model High West does not intend to replace all of its sourced whiskey with house-made distillate. Instead it plans to maintain the brand’s current flavor profiles by replacing certain components with specifically-made house whiskies.Note that bottle batches that begin in 18 (or higher) are the above recipe which debuted in 2018. Lower numbers indicate the older recipe which was made with MGP rye and 16 year-old Barton rye a whiskey that is now impossible to find. If you see a bottle from the old batches at the same price snag it there won’t be any more.Nose Complex with a distinct “young rye” eucalyptus/menthol note that is well-balanced and held in check by a malty sweet cinnamon-roll character complete with that sinful white confectioner’s glaze. Deeper in the glass there are some rye grain and flour notes (bready yeasty nutty).Palate Syrupy body. Moderate to severe tongue burn – a little hot for 46% ABV. Again the sweetness of the older rye perfectly balances the vibrancy and grassiness of the younger. Both are detectable. Toasty nutty sweet and complex. Nice.Finish Medium or medium-long. All of the previous notes continue into the finish. Fades with a dash of charcoal but no bitterness.With Water A few drops of water serve to integrate the components more fully – it’s now harder to discern the young rye and the old rye. Beyond that the palate gains a hint of bakery goodies… monkey bread? Water optional.Overall Pleasant well-balanced and just complex enough to justify the price. Some of the particularities of this whiskey are likely to be lost in a cocktail although if you’re used to a bottom-shelf rye in your Manhattans this is going to be a noticeable step up. As a mixing rye though I don’t think it’s necessarily better than Rittenhouse 100 or Hochstadter’s which are both more straightforward but less eclectic and more suited to “house rye” status. Still if you like to occasionally sip your middle-shelf ryes then High West delivers and for quite a reasonable price. I sure wish I could compare this to the old Barton recipe however…
241,Highland Park (12 year) - I’m a big fan of the Highland Park 18 which I think is a much better value and (in some ways) at least as good as The Macallan 18. I saw a great deal on Highland Park 12 year at Costco a few months ago and snagged it for $32. There seems to be some disagreement on the web about what kind of wood is used for the 12-year. The HP website implies that it uses only ex-sherry casks although plenty of sources online say that anywhere from 10% (for the 12 year) to 50% (for the 15 year) is aged in ex-bourbon American oak. This is the kind of ridiculousness that occurs when producers aren’t upfront about the components of their malts. So.. sherry? No sherry? Who knows I just want to drink it. Today I finally cracked open the 12 to discover if the precursor is as good as the antecedent bottling from this far-flung northern Scotland distillery.Note The UK bottling is 40% ABV (700ml) while the US bottling is 43% ABV (750ml).Nose First impression is of warm earthy peat. Beneath a layer of lemon oil and candied lemon peel. Sharp ginger grapefruit juice. Freshly-baked gingersnap cookies. As it sits in the glass the citrus notes darken and give hints of blood orange and marmalade. Orkney peat is unmistakable and here it is vibrant and enthusiastic although there’s an off-note to the alcohol – just a hair too young. A long rest in the glass reveals some velvety vanilla and lavender.Palate Medium-bodied almost silky and quite smooth. Up front there’s a bitter note – burned almonds – which fades as waves of malted grains brown sugar lemon custard and caramel cover the tongue. The smokiness that was missing from the nose appears here in the form of smouldering hay and spent matches. On the tongue it develops a woody cast and slants towards varnish.Finish Long. The bitter notes re-emerge. Blackened wood and spent campfire war a bit with the clean citrusy flavors. Unfortunately the bitter woody notes prevail and last several minutes. This negative effect seems to fade the more you drink… or maybe that’s just the alcohol talking!With Water Water brightens the peat in the nose considerably yielding freshly-squeezed lemon juice and cider vinegar and heightening the alcohol tickle. On the tongue there is more malt upfront with soft caramels mushroomy peat and roasted almonds. The finish may be slightly less bitter although woodsmoke and barrel tannin persist. This dram is significantly improved overall by the water. I recommend its addition highly.Overall By the time this turns 18 and is exposed to some sherry wood the objectionable bitter/burned flavors will have dissipated and the dram will be heavenly. For now it’s easy to see why the 12-year commands a relatively low price. While it has a lovely lemony nose full of that Orkney peat the bitterness on the tongue and the burned notes in the finish relegate this to the 30-dollar bin. Still another sip covers up the sins of the previous and it’s a sight better than drinking most blends. For a peated dram I’d rather go bigger with Laphroaig 10 for the same price or lighten it up with Auchentoshan Classic or even Glenlivet 12 for less. That said the Orkney peat experience is worth the purchase and I can’t recommend the 18 highly enough.
242,Highland Park (18 year) - I’d been saving this miniature (it’s not every day you find a 50ml sample of an 18 year-old single malt) for a special occasion. Last Wednesday was my birthday so I cracked it open and had my first Highland Park. All of Highland Park’s malts are lightly peated with local Orcadian peat (see Distillery inset) and matured mostly in ex-sherry casks. This combination of sherry and peat is uncommon but very interesting. In the 18 I noticed that the two contrasting elements (fruit-sweet and smokey) were both low-key and also married extremely well. This made for a delicious combination and so well integrated. According to the website all Highland Park whiskies have no coloring additives although the core expressions are chill-filtered. I’m curious to see how many of these flavors are present in the younger 12 year-old distillery bottling.Nose Cider vinegar low-key mossy peat lemon verbena tea lavender peaches and summer fruits. There’s also something sour and juicy – like fat red raspberries. Overall a very fruity tart nose. A few drops of water bring out some tropical fruits – kiwi pina colada pineapple. Nice.Palate Thin body but that tart peat whips in immediately filling the mouth with bursting strawberries blackberries and key lime pie. Evolves on the tongue into softer malty cereal notes marshmallow and nutmeg. The water soups up the burn a little but heightens those same tart flavors.Finish Lengthy. The peat takes center stage echoing the tart nose but now asserting a round smokey presence. This fades into slightly bitter oak cinnamon and black pepper. With water there is a delectable lemon zest note throughout the finish.Overall Not what I expected. This is a versatile chameleon of a dram – sometimes fruity and light sometimes peaty and brooding. While it may not be able to decide what it is there’s no denying the quality of the flavors and the smoothness on the tongue. I recommend a few drops of water which really make this dram dance.
243,Highland Park Magnus - I’m going to start with a quote from the back of the bottle (which – aside – is annoying black glass that makes it 100% impossible to determine how much is left in the bottle. /rant). Ahhem. Highland Park Magnus “…bears the soul of our Viking ancestors and the name of just one our founder Magnus Eunson. Enjoy a whisky crafted in the old way by a new generation of Vikings.” Cute marketing bros but I doubt that your Viking ancestors would have approved of their Akvavit being served at a watery 40% ABV. Ok now that I’ve made my requisite “make fun of the marketing blather on the label” joke we can move on to the whisky.Highland Park is known for “partly” or “half” -peated single malts with a bit of sherry influence. A little of this a little of that… I’ve said before that their Highland Park 12 year is a good introduction for single malt noobs who aren’t sure they’re ready for the full-blast peat of Islay whiskies. Unfortunately the Highland Park 12 suffers for the comparison – it is a little more bitter and a little “rougher” (in terms of off-flavors) than comparably-priced Islay malts. Enter Magnus the new entry-level NAS malt from Highland Park.Like the rest of the line Magnus is partly peated and partly aged in “sherry seasoned” American oak casks. Before you ask that just means they took regular old ex-bourbon casks and sloshed some sherry around in them for a few months. This is becoming pretty standard practice in the scotch whisky industry since nobody drinks actual sherry these days and real sherry barrels are hard to come by. Some refill casks are also used but the distillery says the sherry-seasoned casks are a “high percentage” of the vatting. If you say so Edrington. The result is bottled at an anemic (and very un-Viking) 40% ABV with no added coloring. It doesn’t say if it’s chill-filtered which means it probably is especially at 40% ABV. Magnus seems to be priced where Highland Park 12 used to be priced ($33 – $40 US) with the age-stated whisky now retailing for $42 to $50.You pay the same amount that you’re used to paying and you lose the 12-year age statement and 3% ABV. So what do you get in return?Nose Gentle peat light lemon and orange peel. Grapefruit. Deeper in the glass there’s a nice juicy tangerine note. Sweet light and with only an echo of floral Orkney peat.Palate Thin body. Mild tongue burn. Somewhat sweet on the tongue – shortbread or biscuits. Very slightly acrid – charcoal maybe.Finish Long ish. The citrus peel returns along with some bitter barrel tannin and rosewater. Fades slowly without added complexity.With Water Several drops of water brings out a Lemon Pledge note – turning citrus peels into citrus-scented cleanser. The palate seems softer with a bit more malt. No need for water here.Overall This is very similar to the Highland Park 12 year but with less orange less peat and more lemon. It is however well-balanced and the gentlest possible introduction to peated single malt for the newcomer. With few off notes and little complexity it sits confidently in the middle of its “value malt” price category. I wouldn’t pay more than $40 US for it but I might snatch up another bottle if it drops to $30.To answer the question posed above you “get” a better-balanced malt with less bitterness and arguably more fruit although it lacks those nice orange peel and orange blossom notes from the HP12. If the 12-year were still the same price I would probably still choose it over the Magnus. However I don’t think the 12-year is quite worth $10 more. Still scoffing at sub-$40 whisky is what gets you called “The ScotchSnob” around here (like I haven’t heard that one before) so Recommended it is!
244,Hirsch Small Batch Bourbon - I swear US companies have been putting out new bourbon brands using sourced whiskey faster than I can review them. Anchor Distillers (which is a distillery in California but also does business importing and bottling sourced spirits) has loaded down the Hirsch label with every whisky marketing adjective in the book. This is – no really – Small-Batch Reserve Selected Straight Bourbon Whiskey which is “Crafted” in the USA. It also says “artisanally produced” on the back. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone accusing MGP of being a “craft” distillery but there’s the word on the bottle none-the-less. There’s also a sleight-of-tongue fib on the label “Proudly bottled by Hirsch Distillers Silverton Ohio” nevermind that this is a California company bottling an Indiana bourbon in Ohio.In a more subtle act of market positioning the name hearkens back to a sought-after bottle of bourbon with similar ethos to early Stitzel-Weller releases The A.H. Hirsch Reserve 16 year-old. That brand was produced at the Schaefferstown Distillery in Schaefferstown Pennsylvania which is now known as the Michter’s Distillery and fetches auction prices of more than $2000. Anchor acquired the rights to the brand but thankfully isn’t trying to pass Hirsch Small Batch as the same liquid and certainly isn’t charging a premium for the name or any associations it might have for those in-the-know about bourbon.There is also – glory be! – an age statement on the back of the label. Hirsch Small Batch is “at least 7 years old” and is bottled at a reasonable 46% ABV for an even more reasonable price of $25 a bottle (here at least… I’ve also seen it for as high as $40). The mashbill is a combination of two MGP recipes (60% corn 36% rye 4% malted barley and 75% corn 21% rye 4% malted barley) which I would describe a “high rye” mashbill.Nose A little plastic-y up front which suggests a rest in the glass is in order. Dry and woody with oak sawdust charcoal and faint rock candy. Even after a rest in the glass the plastic character remains although a hint of marzipan (almond paste) and cherry syrup creep in.Palate Medium bodied. Pretty hot for a 46% ABV. Sawdust and charcoal dominate with elements of woody molasses and tobacco. Finish Medium-short. A nice cinnamon-and-sugar note appears on the finish along with mildly bitter barrel char and some mouth-drying oaky tannins.With Water A few drops of water perk up the apparent sweetness a little although the whiskey also yields more fake “plastic” notes in addition. The palate is softer and burns less but no interesting flavors are revealed. Water optional.Overall The whole impression is of dryness and austerity. The flavor and aroma components are sparse there is very little in the way of sweetness and no fruit or floral notes to balance the wood. Despite the claims on the bottle this is a very squarely bottom-shelf bourbon which can disappear into any cocktail you choose without breaking the bank. For what it’s worth at $25 this is a reasonable deal just don’t expect anything interesting if drinking it neat.
245,Hochstadter’s Rye - First an apology to my readers who want me to do more scotch reviews. Yes this is yet another rye. My excuse is that my entire household has been dreadfully sick this week (myself included) and I already had this review written up. A scotch next week. Promise!Cooper Spirits company owner of the brand has taken an interesting approach to the whole “ew sourced whiskey” controversy in the United States. They sourced straight rye whiskies aged between 4 and 15 years from five different North American distilleries located in Kentucky Pennsylvania Indiana (MGP for sure) and Alberta Canada. Then they did what the Scots have been doing successfully for ages and vatted them together. Think a “blended malt” like many Compass Box releases or Monkey Shoulder (review upcoming) but with straight rye instead of malt whisky. This like the work of Compass Box’s John Glaser and High West‘s David Perkins gives the product an air of individuality and validity. They didn’t just pick a batch of barrels and slap their brand name on it; they assembled an assemblage.The vats are maintained at the company’s Philadelphia Pennsylvania headquarters until the components marry and then bottled at a hearty 100 proof (50% ABV) without chill-filtration. At $35+ a bottle we can’t really compare this head-to-head with a cocktail workhorse like Rittenhouse 100 (~$25) but we can have a little taste at least…Nose A burst of florals and fruits red apple freshly-ground cinnamon and clove violets and faint peppermint. Complex and yet light airy vibrant and fresh. This is the kind of whiskey that pulls your nose in deeper. Excellent.Palate Thin body. Spicy with cinnamon red hots and a spike of alcohol burn. This resolves into gingerbread pickled ginger (gari) cherry cordials (minus the chocolate) and a slight oaky sweetness (although the overall impression is quite dry).Finish On the short side. Red apple skin tannins ground ginger and cardamom (anise-like). Fades with assorted (and muddled) dusty spice cabinet jars.With Water Water actually seems to mute the aromatic variety of this rye instead making it hotter (more nose tickle). The palate gains a caraway (rye bread) note and is a little less muddled. The finish is also more vibrant and has a bit of tartness to it. I would skip the water when drinking this neat to preserve the aroma but this tells me that melting ice in a cocktail will only improve the melding of this rye with other ingredients.Overall While the palate and finish are a little muddy the aroma is fascinating and flawless and keeps drawing me back for more. Luckily this makes an expressive fragrant cocktail and is the first time Rittenhouse 100 has been challenged for the “special occasion Manhattan ingredient” spot in my cabinet. I don’t like this quite enough to want to drink it neat on a regular basis but it surpasses Rittenhouse in everything but price.
246,Hyde No. 3 “The Áras Cask” 6 Year-old Irish Single Grain Whiskey - Hyde whisky from Cork newcomer Hibernia Distillers is a range of sourced Irish single-malt and single-grain whiskies on offer to finance the company while a new distillery is being constructed planned (see link at the bottom). This is becoming a familiar story. The whiskey comes from the Cooley distillery (see the link in the previous sentence). Like the Teeling single-grains these “Áras Cask” (not single casks) whiskies are made from a mashbill of corn and barley and column triple-distilled. No. 3 is aged in ex-bourbon casks for 6 years without any fancy finish and bottled without chill filtration or added coloring at the “craft” strength of 46% ABV. Other “numbers” in the range indicate different cask finishes such as pinot noir and rum. Note that the bottles labeled “President’s Cask” are single-malts also from Cooley.A word about this whole “sourced” whisky trend. I have been forgiving (OK and maybe a little sarcastic) because new distilleries without a boatload of investment capital have little choice but to sell other peoples’ whiskey while waiting for a distillery to be built and then for the new spirit to age sufficiently. I can even forgive the less-than-transparent way these brands claim the liquid as their own with high-flying language on the label and big dates of totally unrelated historic events (in this case the Easter Rising of 1916) that make the brand seem established and storied since the truth is usually readily available online with a little effort. I can even give credit where it’s due because the act of choosing independent-market casks for bottling is an art unto itself and deserves a price premium above the wholesale cost of the cask. What I cannot forgive is the wanton release of too-young whiskey from mediocre casks with “craft” pricing. This is not hard-won Kilchoman markups on extraordinary young whisky from an upstart distillery. This is warehouse leftovers (from someone else’s warehouse) with a pretty label slapped on it.It would be remarkable if Hibernia were able to find tasty Cooley single grain at 6 years of age to bottle with a sub-$50 price tag… but that is not what they have done here.Nose Vodka notes up front suggesting a rest in the glass is needed. After a rest there is still an industrial solvent off-note dominating the aroma.Palate Syrupy body. Meaty with nutty toasted hazelnut. Low burn. That industrial off-note remains.Finish Medium-long. Permeated by grimy industrial oil. Finishes with walnut oil burned sugar and a bit of bitterness. Unpleasant.With Water A few drops of water elevate the vodka/acetone note without adding anything of value. Skip the water.Overall The overall impression I have is “unpleasant”. It doesn’t have too much of the young vodka/acetone notes one associates with young grain whiskey but it’s dominated by a grimy ugly note that hovers somewhere between burned sugar and rancid oil. In a word unpleasant. Someone somewhere likes this flavor profile and would be happy to pay $50 for it. I’m not that person.For what it’s worth there are some interesting (and serious) allegations in this article although they mostly boil down to what we already know Hibernia Distillers doesn’t make whiskey they buy it and add some finishing. This is hardly new but if the accusations at that link are true Hibernia is choosing deception to a higher degree than is typical in this industry. Make your own conclusions.Note that the pricing below may be a little off since I had trouble finding enough of a variety of US retailers. If you happen to be looking at European outlets you can probably find this for closer to the US $40 – $50 range at current exchange rates.
247,I.W. Harper Bourbon - The “other” Diageo Bourbon I.W. Harper is another resurrected brand. The Bernheim brothers began selling I.W. Harper in 1879 and it has (like most Bourbon brands) changed hands several times since. It saw a 20-year hiatus in the US although it has been sold continuously in Japan. Now Diageo is bringing it back in two forms This NAS entry-level bourbon and a special-edition 15-year. The NAS has a mashbill of 73% corn 18% rye and 9% barley. The source of the distillate is a bit of a mystery but is possibly a blend of bourbons from Four Roses Brown-Foreman Jim Beam and/or Barton (read Chuck Cowdery’s overview of the brand here) and might also contain some of the distillate from the New Bernheim Distillery. The barrels were aged at the Stitzel-Weller warehouses. (No that doesn’t make it Pappy).The Kentucky Straight Bourbon is bottled in a very handsome bottle “by hand” (why?) in Tullahoma Tennessee at the weird bottling strength of 41% ABV. (1% above the legal minimum. Why bother?)Nose First impression is of something weirdly vegetal – grassy… like trampled wet grass or freshly-turned compost. A rest in the glass reveals a heavy banana note verging on rotting banana peel which eventually resolves into banana sorbet. Not a great start.Palate Thin body. Pecans black pepper and more of that mushy banana. A little dull and vaguely watery. A muddy blend of stale cornbread plain white sugar (and not much of it) swampy oak and spent coffee grounds.Finish Of medium length. Vague brown sugar bitter barrel char dry oaky tannins and a fleeting grassy note like spent sugarcane.With Water Several drops of water reveal a fresher sort of banana and perhaps a little dried coconut. The palate is brighter but the finish is just as dull.Overall Eh. As mediocre a bourbon as I’ve had in a while. A confusing and off-putting aroma bland and watery on the palate and a forgettable finish. The cocktails I’ve made with it are uninteresting. This is a solid “Don’t Bother” in my book.
248,Isle of Jura (10 year) (43% Presentation) - After liking Jura 16 and the NAS Jura Superstition I thought I should explore the rest of the range. The much more reasonably-priced 10 year bottling (also labelled “Jura Origin”) is aged exclusively in ex-bourbon casks and is not peated. As an entry-level unpeated and non-sherried malt it showcases the “blank slate” that Jura’s house character is grown from. While there is a small amount of peat in the water used by Jura I can’t discern it in the glass.Note that Jura appears to bottle the 10 year-old Origin at both 43% and 40% ABV. It’s hard to tell from the information online but the 40% might be for the domestic 700ml European market while the 43% might be for the US 750ml market. This review is from a Jura tasting pack (50ml glass miniatures) with the 43% ABV presentation.Nose Clean and crisp with notes of green apple and fresh pears. Some sweet florals – honeysuckle – and a strong presence of green banana. Slightly grassy like aloe vera. No peat in evidence.Palate Moderately creamy body with an initial wave of vanilla followed by freshly-mown grass unripe fruit aloe juice and dry wood notes.Finish Short. Raw sugar cane plus some slightly bitter wood tannins which fade quickly into faint dry woodiness.With Water A few drops of water intensifies the green banana notes without contributing anything else. The palate however is markedly sweeter with notes of egg custard vanilla pudding and a thicker body. Water is probably a good idea with this.Overall A fairly standard ex-bourbon malt without much age on it. The vanilla and green fruits grass and disappointing finish are hallmarks of a not-quite-ready-yet malt from (possibly) refill bourbon casks. At around $40 a bottle I would probably choose Glenlivet 12 or Glenfiddich 12 or Speyburn 10 over this. Because there are better options around the same price I’m going to mark this as Not Recommended. Still it’s a reasonable price for an entry-level malt without any off flavors.
249,Isle of Jura (16 year) - The Isle of Jura is within spitting distance of the eastern shore of the island of Islay off of Scotland’s southwesterly tip. The tiny island claims only a few hundred inhabitants and exactly one whisky distillery. Perhaps this harkens back to a time in Scotland when every community of 200 people required its own distillery? Sounds like a place I’d like to live!The Isle of Jura distillery is owned by independent bottlers Whyte and MacKay which also owns Dalmore distillery. The whisky of each is surprisingly similar with lots of sherry-derived flavor and some citrus elements. Jura is a little lighter in style and much more floral while Dalmore is darker sweeter and more pungent. Neither is peated except for some peat that might be in the water used to mash and proof down the bottles.The 16 year-old official bottling also subtitled ‘Diurach’s Own’ after the name for the people of Jura spends 14 years in ex-bourbon and then is transferred for 2 years into Amaroso Oloroso sherry casks to finish.Nose Elegant citrus – grapefruit maybe or bergamot. Mildly sherried as befits the finish. If there’s any Island peat present it’s in the form of a soft ferny heathery aroma in the distance. The fruit is fresh and bright and backed up by a capable maltiness with breakfast cereal and spongecake. Soft lovely and floral. Very nice.Palate Slightly chewy texture and quite sweet. Candied orange peels tawny fudge blanched almonds and marzipan. Not an ounce of burn on the tongue. Ladylike even.Finish The heather notes return with honey and a bit of oaky tannins. A final wave of very mild citrus – just pith maybe – and a ghost of bitterness.With Water Several drops of water draw out a bit more of the eccentric aspects of the sherry namely a leather note and some lemon peel which continues through the palate and finish as extra tartness. Water is not needed here but does add something interesting.Overall An eminently likable malt. Flawless in execution sweet and mild on the tongue with a moderately perfumed aroma. This would be excellent with a mild cigar. Jura has a lot of ardent admirers and I can see why. It is not intense nor challenging but it is complex enough to reward contemplation.I have not been able to say this much recently but this malt is definitely worth the $65 or so that it retails for.
250,Isle of Skye (8 year) - Isle of Skye despite the name is a blended scotch containing whisky from several areas of Scotland. Indeed a proportion of Talisker (the only distillery on the island of Skye off the western coast of the Scottish Highlands) is represented as well as a blend of gentler Speyside malts some “Island” (which could refer to Islay Orkney or Skye) malt and some grain whisky. According to the bottler the youngest whisky is 8 years old (which by law dictates the age on the bottle) but the blend contains some “much older” whisky. The blend is aged in an ex-bourbon barrel and bottled at 43% ABV. The company Ian Macleod Distillers will be releasing a 12-year version soon.Nose I’m detecting only a bare suggestion of Talisker. Nice prickly lemon drop and mild peat with some pear notes on top.Palate Burny – evident young grain. Very crisp with marshmallow and more sweet lemon. Peat reveals itself on the tongue as mossy and slightly musty.Finish More smokey than the nose. A little rough and some bitterness creeping in. Finally there is a suggestion of Talisker sea-salt!Overall There can’t be much Talisker in here unless my senses are failing me. The grain component is pretty rough as expected for a youngish blend. The malt which may be of higher proportion than most NAS blends doesn’t provide much Talisker brine peaty character or any fruity/floral speysider qualities. It’s a very in-between whisky for drinkers who don’t like big peat big fruit or big malt. Better than the cheaper NAS blends though especially if you like your peat light and crisp. I would definitely class this above The Black Grouse. I believe that this like many mild mid-range blends will grow on you as you go through a bottle. With only a small sample pour to gauge it I wasn’t impressed. On the upside it’s very cheap at around $28 a bottle.
251,J.H. Cutter Whiskey - In keeping with last week’s weird blend today we have a blend of old-school Kentucky bourbon with a quirky California rye. As such it’s labeled as a “Blend of American Whiskies” not as a “bourbon”. J.H. Cutter is named after the flagship brand of a gold rush whiskey merchant named A.P. Hotaling. The link to Anchor brands best known for Anchor Steam beer and now also named after Hotaling is tenuous. Perhaps someone at Anchor bought the rights to Hotaling’s brands at some point. It’s kind of irrelevant to the liquid though isn’t it?The liquid in fact is a blend of 73% sourced bourbon from Bardstown (aka Kentucky Bourbon Distillers / KBD aka Willett) 17% Old Potrero 18th Century Style Rye Whiskey (which is 100% malted rye) and 10% Old Potrero Port Finish Rye Whiskey. Old Potrero is one of Anchor’s whiskey brands distilled and aged in San Francisco California. The reported ages of the components seem to vary on the Internet so assume they’re all somewhere between 2.5 and 4.5 years old. The blend is bottled at a robust 48% ABV.Nose Vaguely malty (from the Potrero malted rye) with hints of corn alongside malted milk balls orange peel cardamom and rye spices. Lilacs and other florals plus a very light fruity note like pear drops. A rest in the glass reveals more bourbon-like notes with dark corn syrup and toasted oak.Palate Thin body. Moderate tongue burn appropriate for 48% ABV. Tastes more like a lighter-style bourbon now with corn-forward flavors cherry syrup spicy rye notes and a welcome continuation of the pear drops from the aroma. Reminds me of some High West rye-based blends I’ve had. Finish Medium length. Not bitter or tannic at all. The fruits persist and a mouth-drying menthol note kicks in early. The maltiness comes back in the end like vanilla marshmallows and frosted cereal. Pleasant.With Water The addition of a few drops of water initially mutes the aroma requiring a rest in the glass. Even then the only thing that wakes up is the nose tickle. Skip water here.Overall A very pleasant subtle perfumed even dainty whiskey with a mixture of familiar and novel flavors. The port finish comes through in faint pear drops (I love that) while the two whiskies shift between rye spiciness and light corn sweetness back and forth over the palate. I got a sweet deal for $34 which makes this an approachable experiment. Much above $45 and I wouldn’t feel like I had gotten my money’s worth. It is very young whisky after all although Anchor has done an excellent job masking the youth behind good old-fashioned flavor.
252,J.P. Wiser’s Canadian Rye Whisky - Oh Canada. When will you start sending some of your good whisky south of the border? I know you make it up there and I know you keep most of it for yourselves. Meanwhile the hapless American whisky consumer sees an attractive bottle of “Canadian Rye Whisky” on the shelf for a bargain-basement price of $15 and snaps it up. “It’s got rye in it” he thinks “so it can’t be all bad!”Now when Canadian whisky bottles (many of which are actually bottled in the US from tanker trucks of the stuff) say “rye” they mean it has “some” rye in it unlike a bottle in the US that says “Rye Whiskey” which must have at least 51% rye grain in the mash. That’s not necessarily a good or bad thing just a major difference between Canadian and American rye whisky. J.P. Wiser’s is made at the Hiram-Walker & Sons distillery in Windsor Ontario and the brand is owned by Corby Distileries. I can’t find any recipe information online but it’s basically a blend of corn rye and other grains distilled on a continuous column still and aged for at least three years in oak barrels (apparently ex-bourbon ones) and bottled at 40% ABV.For $15 you can’t ask for much but if you want to see what real Canadian rye is all about Corby’s own Lot 40 is a fantastic introduction and so far my favorite Canadian whisky. It’s also made with 100% rye grain (some of which is malted) and that’s what I call rye. I think it’s amazing that Lot 40 and J.P. Wiser’s are distilled at the same facility and yet show such a wide gap in quality. As always you get what you pay for (Lot 40 is around three times the price of JPW) but after tasting it and mixing it I think J.P. Wiser’s could cost $2 for all the good it does my cabinet.Nose Toffee or butterscotch. The nose is fairly faint which some might call “smooth” while others might call it “bland”. There is sweetness but it has an artificial bent. Of rye there is nary a sign.Palate Lightly sweet and so “smooth” that there is neither much tongue burn nor much flavor. A faint cereal note a manufactured caramel note and.. that’s all folks.Finish Short. A reprise of the palate with still no hint of rye character. A slight chemical bitterness – like the residue on new plastic – forms the tail end of the finish.With Water At this ABV and lightness of character water isn’t warranted. Indeed adding it only heightened the artificial sweetness now like bottled corn syrup.Overall It is perhaps not fair to rate this whisky neat. It was likely not intended to compete with single malt or straight bourbon. Still with the word ‘rye’ on the label you’d expect a little spice or something. The sweet flavors are artificial and the whisky flavors so light as to be ignorable. I suppose you could mix drinks with it but unless you’re allergic to flavor a similarly-priced bourbon is likely to give you more bang for your whiskey buck in any cocktail. It says “Quality is something you just can’t rush” on the bottle which leads me to wonder if this whiskey was made in record time.
253,J.P. Wiser’s Canadian Whisky (18 year) - I should learn by now that big-league Canadian whisky and I don’t really mesh. While learning about drinking I did not come to value “smoothness” (a term that has a nebulous definition when it comes to whisky) above all including above flavor. Furthermore after several ill-spent college years drinking overly-sweet stuff like Smirnoff Ice and neon-dyed “Schnapps” (an insult to actual Schnapps) I developed an aversion to cloyingly-sweet beverages of all kinds especially when accompanied by the flavor of grain neutral spirits which have a distinct flavor and aroma of glue or industrial solvents. So when I taste something like J.P. Wiser’s Canadian Rye and I get overly-sweet glue-flavored “smooth” whisky that costs so little to produce that they can make a profit at $15 a bottle I tend to react poorly.Along comes a bottle that offers to turn the tide A $55 bottle of Canadian blended whisky with 18 years of aging under its belt. I mean it’s a great value but not dirt-cheap and you can’t fake 18 years in oak. There’s not a lot of information online about the whisky itself. It’s a Hiram Walker brand previously known as Wiser’s Very Old. It is a blended Canadian whisky meaning a blend of grain whiskies (rye optional). The components are mashed distilled and aged separately and then blended together in batches for bottling. The 18 is bottled at an anemic 40% ABV.I dropped the $55 and figured that if nothing else it would make a forgettable sipping whisky that wouldn’t object to an ice cube on a humid summer evening…Nose Glue. After a rest in the glass to disperse any aroma of adhesives the nose is suggestive of rye but contains a lot of vanilla and heavy syrupy sweetness. Somewhat cloying like a heavily frosted cinnamon bun on a sweltering hot day. Also banana bread corn pudding and a ghostly echo of that glue (think grade-school rubber cement).Palate Syrupy body. Rye bread up front complete with toasted caraway seed plus rye grain cinnamon and clove. The sweetness is suffusive but not quite as cloying as suggested by the nose. It’s also not very nuanced – try to imagine eating a spoonful of white corn syrup out of the bottle.Finish Short. As soon as I swallow the whisky’s character evaporates. There might be a whiff of vanilla and clove left behind.With Water I hesitate to add any water at all but a few drops release an amped-up wave of bakery spices before settling back into cloying sugary-ness. The palate is unchanged as is the finish. No water needed here.Overall I would have assumed that 18 years in oak would have at least added some oaky complexity or mellowed those weird glue notes into something nuanced. Tasted blind I would have said this was American rye at 4 or 5 years of age that had been watered down to 30% ABV and had corn syrup added to it. None of that is true but that is the impression left upon me by my three attempts to appreciate the “Tradition of Quality and Craftsmanship” promised by the label.At the risk of reawakening the tired NAS discussion I’d like to point out that this is a good example of advanced age on the label not equating to quality in the glass.I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do with the rest of the bottle. I can’t think of any cocktails that this would improve. Coke maybe?
254,Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Tennessee Whiskey - I’m about the furthest thing there is from an expert on American whiskey or bourbon. I’ve never particularly liked bourbon. In fact my dislike for bourbon was the reason I hadn’t even tried Scotch until I was 26. Whiskey is Whisky right? Not at all. One of the bewildering (and enchanting) facets of so-called ‘brown spirits’ is the vast array of flavors and types and the huge differential in apparent quality available today. Unfortunately I have yet to find a bourbon (or any spirit made in the U.S.) which rivals any single Scotch in my cabinet. This is not an indictment of the US whiskey industry but rather a failing on my part to seek out and taste anything pricier than a bottle of Evan Williams. I fear that my innate bias against bourbon has ruined me for life from my native country’s indigenous whiskey but I hope to someday be redeemed. Until then I will continue to post my impressions of every spirit I taste à la minute good or bad.But you’re the “Scotch Noob” right? What gives? I considered “The Whisk(e)y Noob” when starting my blog but it didn’t have the same ring. Frankly the whole whiskey/whisky terminology thing bums me out anyway. So while I focus on the whisky of Scotland on this blog I will continue to post my experiences with any of its ilk whiskey whisky bourbon rye new make (white dog) whatever. Call me egalitarian. 🙂So when I see a 50ml sample of Jack Daniel’s “Single Barrel” at the local Beverages & More it sets me back on my heels. My impression of Jack Daniel’s is rooted in my college party days and the concept of drinking “Jack” out of anything but a shooter or a glass of Coca Cola is foreign to me. The product is just what it sounds like Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whiskey (not bourbon as kindly pointed out by James K. in the comments) from hand-picked barrels (generally those higher up in the warehouse where they supposedly get a more ‘intense’ maturation if you can believe the marketing line). Filled into bottles at 47% ABV without vatting. Like any Single-Barrel product the quality and characteristics will vary from one bottling run to the next (each barrel yields approximately 240 bottles). At its heart though this is the exact same whiskey that goes into those ubiquitous black bottles. Is it worth the *gasp* $45 price tag? Let’s find out.Color AmberNose Corn syrup candy corn almonds or peach pit brash alcohol turpentine green apple.Palate Initial rush is sweet cake-y. Body is thin and the burn is moderate. On the tongue there is sweet corn some ash and wood char. A dash of water opens up the flavor a little yielding more toasted oats malted milk and brown sugar.Finish Longer than expected with some butterscotch or caramel notes and a lot of dark brown sugar or molasses with a lingering hint of marshmallow and spun sugar that lasts several minutes. Unfortunately it is accompanied by that “impure spirits” aftertaste you get with cheap vodkas like mineral oil and cough syrup.Overall not as harsh and young-tasting as the principal Jack Daniel’s bottling. Whatever happens to those barrels up in the upper floors of the warehouse it makes for a better product in the bottle. However in my totally biased opinion this is not $45 worth of whiskey. It also doesn’t change my mind about American whiskey or bourbon. Oh well. More to come when I find a way to taste some!
255,James E. Pepper 1776 100-Proof Rye - Wow am I phoning it in. Something about a nice summer weekend with lots of house-related projects to do makes me disinterested in reviewing whiskey. So I’m reviewing something that is exactly the same as something that I reviewed awhile back except it’s about 8% lower ABV and about $15 less. The Lazy Noob more like am I right?James E. Pepper a historic brand purportedly established in 1780 (NOT in 1776) but mothballed in 1958 was distilled at several sites in Kentucky including the now-abandoned James E. Pepper distillery in Lexington KY. In 2008 the rights to the brand were purchased by the Georgetown Trading Co. and re-launched using sourced whisky from various distilleries. The rye bottlings like many modern rye whiskies are made at LDI in Indiana (now called MGP). The bourbon bottlings were previously contracted out of the Corsair distillery but are now all MGP as well. The Georgetown Trading Co. announced in 2016 that the historic James E. Pepper distillery in Lexington would be renovated and reopened as a craft distillery and museum which opened in December of 2017. It will be interesting to see what happens around January 2021 when that house-made whiskey can go into this expression.The brand makes several bourbons and three ryes a 100 proof a barrel proof and a 15 year-old. The barrel proof rye is the exact same whiskey as this 100-proof straight rye except that it is bottled at cask strength. Both come from a mashbill of 90% rye and both are bottled without chill-filtration. The bottle says “aged over 3 years” which we can safely assume means it’s three years old tops.Nose Spicy and peppery and slightly vegetal with clear “young rye” eucalyptus and menthol notes. Fresh mint orange peel clove and root beer (Sassafras). A rest in the glass reveals a few welcome floral notes.Palate Thin body. Hardy tongue burn (expected at 100 proof). Green grass and crushed mint orange zest and root beer persist on the palate and the whole is fully-flavored but dry (not very sweet).Finish Medium-short. The mint carries through although the finish turns a little bitter. Bitter roots mild charcoal and very slight mouth-drying oak tannins. Fades quickly without evolving.With Water A few drops of water increase the nose tickle without adding any additional aromas. The palate becomes a bit woody (odd that) and the finish displays more tannins plus a rush of black licorice. Water optional.Overall It’s funny what a few small differences can mean for the overall recommendability (nope still not a word) of a whiskey. The cask-strength rye suffered in my review for its middle-of-the-road character that didn’t quite live up to its $40 price tag. Drop the ABV a few percent (and much more importantly drop the price $15) and I start calling it a very well put-together rye if a touch on the young side. Luckily those youthful notes are all of the grass/mint variety and not in the “paint thinner” category. A solid rye for the price and certainly a good choice for whiskey-based cocktails but I still prefer Rittenhouse 100 and Hochstadter’s for the “budget rye” spot on my shelf. Still if the liquor store is out of those two this one works just fine for the money. And as we determined above don’t cough up the extra $15 for the Barrel Proof. It’s not worth it.
256,James E. Pepper 1776 Barrel Proof Rye - I’m partial to a rye Manhattan and especially partial to one made with high-proof rye. So when shopping for a new bottle to replace the latest dead soldier in my cabinet James E. Pepper 1776 caught my eye. $37 straight rye bottled at 58.6% ABV? Sounds like it would be perfect for a Manhattan! I picked it up.Before we continue I’d like to make something clear. I review whiskies based on their sippability (nope that’s not a word) NOT their mixological potential (also not a word). My philosophy is that if I don’t like it straight up it’s not going to make a worthy cocktail. Note that the converse is not true; a whisky that is good neat does not always make a good cocktail. Ever had a Laphroaig Rob Roy? Yuck. Further just because a whisky tastes good does not mean I’m willing to put it in a cocktail. Generally my bottles costing in excess of $50 are reserved for sipping. This is not some kind of over-arching Law of Whisky that Ye Shall Not Break… I just don’t like the idea of pouring expensive whisky in with other ingredients over ice thus muddling and masking the very individuality that I paid for in the first place. Put another way the difference between a $15 whisky and a $40 whisky in a cocktail can be huge. The difference between a $40 whisky and an $80 whisky in a cocktail is usually minor at best. So why waste the $80 stuff?James E. Pepper a historic brand purportedly established in 1780 (NOT in 1776) but mothballed in 1958 was distilled at several sites in Kentucky including the now-abandoned James E. Pepper distillery in Lexington KY. In 2008 the rights to the brand were purchased by the Georgetown Trading Co. and re-launched using sourced whisky from various distilleries. The rye bottlings like many modern rye whiskies are made at LDI in Indiana (now called MGP). The bourbon bottlings were previously contracted out of the Corsair distillery but are now all MGP as well. The Georgetown Trading Co. announced in 2016 that the historic James E. Pepper distillery in Lexington would be renovated and reopened as a craft distillery and museum tentatively scheduled to open in 2017. (Update It opened in December of 2017.)The brand makes several bourbons and three ryes a 100 proof this barrel proof and a 15 year-old. Bottled at 58.6% ABV and aged “over 2 years” (which one can assume means under 3 years) the barrel proof rye retails for around $40 a bottle which is not out of line for a young cask-strength rye. The barrel proof rye is the exact same whisky as the 100-proof except that it is bottled at cask strength. Both come from a mashbill of 90% rye and both are bottled without chill-filtration.Nose A blast of rye favorites cinnamon clove stale nutmeg plus a hint of cherry and a wave of marzipan. Potent and concentrated and not suggestive of young under-matured rye. Palate Medium-bodied. Dry and super hot (duh). Dusty spices and bright-red maraschino cherries. Spiced cider and baked apples (very reminiscent in fact of Applejack). Tobacco and black pepper.Finish Medium-long. Apples again and the requisite spices plus more black pepper. Drying and nicely oaky. Fades with some charcoal and without bitterness but it’s so dry that it seems a little unbalanced.With Water Several drops of water have little effect on the aroma. They also fail to dampen the tongue burn. A much larger splash does something interesting a huge dose of cherry pie filling on the nose (almost sweet!) and a much softer grain-forward palate with more bakery (as opposed to dry spice cabinet) spices. The finish also has a little caramel on it. If you find this to be one-dimensional or overly dry at full strength try proofing it down to 45% or so. It’s worth the effort.Overall This is exactly what I’d expect from a $40 mass-produced factory rye at cask strength One-dimensional high-rye notes of spices without a lot of sweetness or complexity to back it up. I tried it in a Manhattan and was mildly disappointed. The barrel proof kicks up a potent cocktail (which I like) but the dryness and peppery-ness fail to balance with the vermouth and the spice notes are lost or become dusty. The result is a dry one-dimensional cocktail with power but no finesse.For an interesting comparison read my review of the 100-proof rye which is only different in ABV (by 8.6%) and price.
257,James E. Pepper 1776 Bourbon - James E. Pepper a historic brand purportedly established in 1780 (NOT in 1776) but mothballed in 1958 was distilled at several sites in Kentucky including the long-abandoned James E. Pepper distillery in Lexington KY. In 2008 the rights to the brand were purchased by the Georgetown Trading Co. and re-launched as a line of several bourbons and three ryes using sourced whisky from various distilleries. The rye bottlings like many modern rye whiskies are made at LDI (now called MGP) in Indiana. The bourbon bottlings were originally contracted out of the Corsair distillery in Kentucky but are now all sourced from MGP as well.The Georgetown Trading Co. announced in 2016 that the historic James E. Pepper distillery in Lexington would be renovated and reopened as a craft distillery and museum and began distillation again in December of 2017. Bottles available today (2018) are still from MGP. Note that the company has announced that whiskies made at the new distillery will have distinct labels and that sourcing of bourbon and rye from other distilleries for the 1776 brand will continue although initial runs from the new distillery’s small output may be blended into the contracted juice.This bottle (labelled Straight Bourbon) is 100 proof (50% ABV) and is not chill-filtered. The MGP bourbon comes from a high-rye mash bill (likely their 60% corn 36% rye and 4% barley one) — although note the James E. Pepper website lists it as “over 38% rye” which is either a mistake or an indication that MGP is producing a custom recipe for Georgetown Trading. I’ve complained in the past (and will continue to complain in the future) about the prevalence of sourced whiskey in so many modern bourbon brands. I am however impressed with Georgetown Trading Co. for both their transparency about the source of their juice as well as their follow-through in actually opening a new working distillery. Also MGP makes some excellent whiskey. Let’s see if this qualifies.Nose Needed some time to wake up after pouring from a fresh bottle. Although still very shy the aroma reveals deep sugary fudge cherry cordial and a dark resinous furniture polish. Brooding if I’m allowed to anthropomorphize.Palate Medium bodied. Tannic with an eye-searing tongue burn up front. After wiping my eyes with as much manliness as I could muster… nope still burning hold on… “Small sips man c’mon… small sips.” Ok. Black forest cake (chocolate and cherries) fudge again black walnut sawdust drippy tree resin and more furniture polish. Still brooding.Finish Of medium length. Cocoa powder (dry dusty) drying barrel tannin but no charcoal bitterness. Fades without changing.With Water A hearty splash of water does little for the aroma although it does dampen the tongue burn a bit. For that alone try a little water (or even ice) with this one. The finish also picks up a little welcome herbaceousness – perhaps mint.Overall Woah. This is some serious-business bourbon. Deep dark sweet and pungent this blows the socks off of the last bourbon I reviewed and is $13 less per bottle. If it weren’t for the lack of presence on the aroma this would give Buffalo Trace a run for the “budget” bourbon on my shelf. Definitely a good value bourbon and worth some attention. I have noticed some disparities in pricing – make sure you’re seeing this in the same range as Buffalo Trace ($27 for me) not in the Michter’s range ($40 for me). For what it’s worth this bourbon makes excellent Old Fashioneds… big and bold and stands up well to both bitters and ice.
258,Jefferson’s Very Small Batch Bourbon - In preparation for National Bourbon Heritage Month this September I’ve been drinking some bourbon. Anything for an excuse right? Like last week’s Corner Creek Reserve Jefferson’s doesn’t distill their own whiskey – they source from elsewhere most likely Kentucky Bourbon Distillers just like everybody else and where KBD got the juice is anybody’s guess. Note that other Jefferson’s products such as the Presidential Select line were previously bottled from Stitzel-Weller stock (aka Pappy Van Winkle) so Jefferson’s certainly isn’t locked down to only buying product from KBD. That said the fact that the Very Small Batch has a consistent mashbill tells me it’s all from the same distillery whichever one it is. Ah what a tangled mess…Also what’s with the 41.15% ABV? I mean what was wrong with 41%? It doesn’t even make a clever number when converted to proof 82.3 proof. Woo-hoo.Apparently the “very small batch” refers to the use of only a few (around 8) barrels per batch which are blended together to achieve a target character. That means each batch will be somewhat different although 8 barrels of sourced whiskey is probably enough to achieve some consistency. The Internet in its infinite wisdom has revealed to me that the mashbill is 60% corn 30% rye and 10% malted barley and the whiskies used are aged for between 6 and 10 years. Verily thou shalt not question the validity of information obtained from the Internet!My bottle is #0245 from Batch 444.Nose Soft grains; fresh corn with a sweet coconut-and-banana tone. Vanilla buttercream with sugars verging on caramel. Very slight spiciness more like cinnamon bun than the actual spice.Palate Medium-full body. Slightly hot. A bit of sugar cane appears with its hint of vegetation and an edge of charcoal. Oaky with not as much sweetness as was promised on the aroma.Finish Medium-long. Some bitterness oak tannin and more charcoal. Fades with a bit of honey like candy corn and marzipan.With Water A few drops of water bring that green sugar cane note to the aroma which becomes almost grassy. It also adds more vanilla but thins the palate. It’s a little less hot. This bourbon can handle a little water but doesn’t need it.Overall A respectable mid-range bourbon. There are more sweet notes promised to the nose than are delivered to the palate but on the whole it’s well balanced and non-threatening. This would make a reasonable house bourbon (it’s slightly sweeter slightly less vegetal and slightly less complex than my usual go-to bourbon Buffalo Trace but I don’t like it quite as much as my new favorite Eagle Rare 10). It definitely makes tasty Old Fashioneds which is what the rest of this bottle disappeared into.
259,Jim Beam “Pre-Prohibition Style” Rye - I complain a lot on this blog about whisky marketing. I have a short fuse when it comes to whisky companies claiming authenticity when no effort has been made to actually produce something authentic. It’s not that I have some kind of pseudo-Millennial disdain for inauthenticity; if you’re making an industrial product and you are clear about that I have no qualms. It’s when you take the same boring old mass-produced minimum-aged factory swill raise the proof slightly and release it as “Pre Prohibition Style” with lots of marketing verbiage about “rediscovering” old recipes and “reformulating” for “bygone” blah blah blah that I have a problem. This is just Beam straight rye (likely at 4 years and a day old) at 45% ABV. Maybe – MAYBE – if they had anything whatsoever to say about what their “oldest recipe” entails or why it has anything to do with pre-Prohibition distillation or really any information at all about why this is different from the 40% ABV version that this is replacing I MIGHT have been a little less cynical.That’s it. That’s the review.Nose Grassy Beam character with a healthy dose of green apple freshly-mown grass and fresh corn kernels. The dominant note on the aroma is tart that green apple almost turning into lime juice. There is very little of the expected rye profile no cinnamon no clove and only a hint of anise. Still there are no unpleasant notes and no “paint thinner” or chemical smells.Palate Syrupy body. Hot with an unpleasant amount of burn for a 90 proof whiskey. Burnt caramel caramel apple unroasted coffee beans and (at last) a swath of bakery spices. Now it tastes like a rye although the youthful grassy notes are still evident.Finish Medium-short. Tart again with more apple and now candy-corn. This fades quickly leaving apple skins slightly bitter barrel char and a touch of paint thinner.With Water Several drops of water make this smell even more like Beam More grass. The water also adds a green banana / unripe coconut note to both the aroma and palate. The palate and finish also acquire a weird “fruit” punch or bubblegum flavor. Water is not necessary with this one but won’t ruin anything either.Overall This is really not bad for $16 a bottle. If you forgive the young grassy notes the faintness of the rye spices on the aroma and the lackluster and kind-of unpleasant finish you could do WAY worse for under $20 a bottle. I still prefer my old standbys Rittenhouse 100 and Hochstadter’s but those do cost more…I chose a “Not Recommended” rating but really what I mean is “Recommended only if you really can’t spend an extra $4 on Rittenhouse 100”. Note that when mixed into a cocktail the low price does shine through If you’re buying strictly for cocktails don’t skimp this much.
260,Jim Beam Original (White Label) - Talk about a review long-overdue. It’s easy when one gets swept up into the current of whisky fandom to ignore the roots of the industry. It’s easy to assume that anything priced at the bottom of the market has to be inferior swill. I’ve certainly contributed my fair share to this trope. Sometimes it’s even true. Regardless every whisky deserves to be considered on its own merits and not on its perception. To that end I give you Jim Beam.A surprise to some new whisky lovers Beam products are all over the place. Many people drinking Knob Creek or Booker’s Baker’s or Basil Hayden’s bourbon because of the higher price point and higher street cred don’t realize they’re drinking Jim Beam just older or from a different part of the warehouse.Jim Beam sold more than 11 million gallons of bourbon in 2017 and accounts for around 21% of the US market share. Those big numbers are largely due to brand loyalty and product placement and promotion in bars. I have to remind myself that most people do not read whisky blogs to expose themselves to new products… most people pick a brand and stick to it. So is Beam slop for the uneducated or is it actually worth drinking?The bourbon’s basic recipe is a low-rye mash bill of 77% corn 13% rye and 10% malted barley. It’s aged for 4 years (probably exactly 4 years to the day considering the volume that the company puts out) allowing it to be called “Straight Bourbon” without an age statement on the bottle. If it were aged 3 years and 364 days then by law it would have to specify a “3 year” age statement on the label. It’s bottled at 40% ABV the legal minimum and retails for bottom-dollar around $10 – $15 a bottle.Nose Very sweet with a pronounced bubble gum / fruit punch / tutti-frutti aroma. Neon maraschino cherries. Not shy a good concentration on the nose but not a lot of dimension (oak corn charcoal nothin’). This imbalance only increases with a rest in the glass showing even more fruit punch.Palate Medium bodied. Mild tongue burn. A lot of the aroma notes are present here – the fruit punch in particular. There is a layer of slight nuttiness (like peanut skins without the peanuts) and a hint of charcoal. Very little oak and almost no caramelized sugars.Finish Short. Some marshmallow and (of course) fruit punch. No tannins. Fades quickly with only a hint of bitterness. Forgettable.With Water A few drops of water change nothing on the aroma but they add a “white sugar” note and associated sweetness on the palate. The finish is a little livelier with some nuttiness added. Take or leave water as you like.Overall Look it’s not bad. There I said it. It’s just not as good as “The world’s No. 1 bourbon” as the label claims ought to be… but then the “World” doesn’t pick its “No. 1” based solely on taste. There are so many flavors that I associate with “bourbon” as a category – charcoal burnt sugar caramel heavy oaky sweetness etc. and none of those are in evidence with Jim Beam. It has a prominent fruity sweetness (which verges on the “fake” corn syrupy candy notes found in some cheap whiskies) and it indeed has 40% alcohol in it by volume. That’s about it. Tasting blind I’m not certain I’d be able to guess that it was even bourbon.I’ve noticed in the past that some bourbons carry that distinctive “fruit punch / bubble gum” note. Among them Filibuster Boondoggler Smooth Ambler Old Scout Basil Hayden’s (THAT makes sense) McAfee’s Benchmark and Rebel Yell. I’m not sure where it comes from but it usually (not always) appears at the lower end of the bourbon price range.To orient myself I poured a small glass of Old Bardstown ($20) to compare against the Beam. The sweetness and fruitiness of the Beam liquid caused the Bardstown to seem herbal and vegetal in comparison but the presence of oak on the palate reminded me of what I expect from a whiskey that spends 4 years in new oak barrels. I would trade two bottles of Beam for one bottle of Old Bardstown any day of the week.If you drink Beam because of the price and upgrading to a $20 bottle sounds like it would be outside of your budget I have two things to say One good for you for recognizing and living inside of your means. Most people can’t or aren’t willing to do that. Two you could certainly do worse for $10 a fifth and Beam does not taste like paint thinner. Because of that I’m going to stick a very (very) hesitant Recommended rating on this. If you can handle the extra ten bucks though you owe it to yourself to try some Old Bardstown Very Old Barton or any other bourbon in that price range.
261,John Barr Reserve Blended Scotch - The whisky boom has had an interesting effect on dead and delinquent brands. Soaring whisky interest and demand has led to old defunct abandoned or simply languishing brand names and trademarks to be reinvigorated or downright resurrected in an effort to grasp at some of that overt demand. This has lead to extinct American whisky brands like Bomberger’s Declaration and Michter’s to be re-launched (although under different ownership and without access to the original distillery). It’s also led to the rebuilding and relaunching of closed Scottish distilleries such as the recently-announced Brora Port Ellen and Rosebank projects. Other brands once relegated to the dustbin of consumer apathy are being dusted off and re-launched with much fanfare. John Barr once a DCL (Diageo) underperformer and now a Whyte and Mackay label is one of those.Created in 1978 to compensate for a legal skirmish that took Johnnie Walker Red Label off of UK store shelves it failed to recapture even a portion of that lost market share. The label was quickly sold off during the Guinness acquisition of DCL that created Diageo in 1986 to Whyte & Mackay (via Invergordon Distillers) of Dalmore fame. Whyte & Mackay master blender and celebrity whisky personality Richard Paterson re-formulated the recipe likely a necessity since the blend now needed to be composed of whiskies available to W&M instead of the full Diageo stable. In early 2017 the brand was re-launched with new packaging under two expressions John Barr Finest and a premium blend containing older malt and a smokier profile called John Barr Reserve. These are still intended to compete directly against Johnnie Walker Red Label and Black Label respectively.This review was suggested by a reader. I apologize in advance if I didn’t like this as much as you did… if I had not noticed the specific off-note on the finish I probably would have appreciated the whisky a lot more considering its excellent price-point.NOTE! This review is of the “old label” (pictured). I can’t find solid information online about whether the 2017 relaunch and new labeling is accompanied by a different blend recipe or not. If anyone has tried the old and new labels side-by-side I’d be interested to hear your impressions!Nose Very slight peat (more fungal than smoky) over a mildly sweet vanilla malt. Faint rock candy and a touch of caramel. Not obviously grainy.Palate Mildly syrupy body. Sweet and malt-forward with loads of baked goods (scones) caramel and a hint of black pepper. On the tongue the grain elements are revealed with a twinge of young grain that comes across as glue (rubber cement).Finish An ugly twist of industrial solvent (acetone) ruins an otherwise middling experience. The whole of the finish is swallowed up in shudder-inducing paint thinner and charcoal. Blech.With Water A few drops of water muddle the aroma releasing some nondescript fruit notes but confusing the rest. No real change on the palate or finish. I would avoid the water with this one. (Also avoid ice – it does NOT help.)Overall Apologies to the reader who suggested this one. It has a mild promisingly inoffensive aroma and a middling palate marred by a very common (for this price-point) grain-whisky-induced glue (or vodka-like) note. The whole thing goes down the proverbial tubes on the finish which is entirely overwhelmed by raw grain alcohol notes and acetone. One really shouldn’t expect very much from a $23 scotch even one blended by legendary blender Richard Paterson but a side-by-side comparison with Bank Note (which has an actual age statement) leaves no doubt about what can be achieved even at this market segment of razor-thin margins. Maybe the $50+ “Blue Label” from John Barr is better but I cannot in conscience recommend this one when Bank Note and even Johnnie Walker Black Label exist.
262,Johnnie Walker Black Label (12 year) Blended Scotch - I’ve always (since I began drinking scotch) had a lively lack of respect for the Johnnie Walker line of blended scotch from Diageo. It represents to me the wrong end of the spectrum between artisanal hand-crafted small-batch spirits and factory mass-produced lowest-bidder penny-squeezing corporate swill. I personally don’t believe that quality and greed can coexist in the same producer whether that producer is making whisky wine cheese or furniture. Diageo has publicly stated that since most of its significant global revenue comes from blended whisky like Johnnie Walker it would happily close down its high-cost low-margin single malt bottlings and focus entirely on dumping vats of malt into vats of grain for blends if it could. That does not sound (to me) like a company interested in providing a high-quality product to a discerning consumer.That said this blog is meant for evaluating the taste (not just the politics) of whisky so I thought it high time I give a thoughtful look at the quintessential Johnnie Walker whisky the Black Label. This is a standard blend of some unknown percentage of malt and grain whiskies all at least 12 years old and represents something like 130 million liters of annual sales (that’s an old figure from 2005 and includes all Johnnie Walker blends – this info is surprisingly hard to find online). Suffice it to say they make a LOT of the stuff and it sells at a fantastic rate worldwide. The component malts of Johnnie Walker are (along with 36 other malts and grains at varying percentages) Cardhu Talisker and Lagavulin. Doubtless a little bit of every Diageo-owned malt (except Oban) is included. It’s a safe bet that the majority of the malt here is Cardhu 12-year although some marketing material claims that “the heart” is Talisker. After tasting it I doubt that.I don’t usually remark on color but I noticed that JW Black has an unnatural red-gold color. It is most certainly heavily colored with caramel coloring.Nose A light Highland peachiness (Dalwhinnie?). Pretty floral. Light and inoffensive. Totally unable to detect any peat. Deeper in round and mildly buttery. Nary a hint of paint thinner!Palate Medium-bodied. Mild tongue burn – I guess that would be called ‘smooth’. Vanilla cake bread crumbs a slight hint of smouldering match head and a few seconds later an acidic wave of vodka-esque off notes.Finish Slightly acrid like a smear of coal tar on top of a buttered scone. Fading out with some almond paste and only a little bitter woodiness. On the short side.With Water Elevated florals and a hint of peach pit on the nose. Shortbread and crumb cake on the slightly thinner palate. A nice woody marshmallow and some caramel on the finish. This is quite improved by the addition of a splash of water.Overall Ok fine it’s really not that bad. It has some nice floral elements in the nose a straightforward flavor and not too much bitterness on the finish. That said it has two major downsides First it was clearly blended to be bland and uninteresting (the industry euphemism is ‘consistent’). There might be peated malt in here but it’s so diluted that it just comes across like a fine layer of stale ash. The florals would be interesting if they weren’t overpowered by a wash of cereally grain. Second the grain component is obvious and not harmoniously integrated with the malts. It provides some nice heft and body on the palate and a bit of creaminess but its relative youth – although 12 isn’t too bad – and lack of quality can be tasted in the vodka notes on the tongue. Frankly it would be hard for this not to taste mass-produced.For $30 you could certainly do worse but I feel that for a little more money one could enjoy a wide variety of single-malts that shine in their own ways rather than continuously pour cash into the Diageo blend machine and be satisfied with a muddy uninteresting jumble of substandard malt barrels and bottom-dollar grain. (That’s hyperbole the bottom-dollar grain goes in the Red Label). Here’s an idea buy a bottle of Dalwhinnie 15 or Cardhu 12 for the florals a bottle of Cragganmore 12 for the malty sweetness and a bottle of Caol Ila 12 for the punch of smoke and blend yourself a personalized (and far superior) Black Label blended malt.
263,Johnnie Walker Green Label (15-year) - When writing about scotch whisky in any capacity Johnny Walker is invariably an elephant in the room. You have Adherents to the Faith that will swear that Johnnie is all the scotch they need and anything else is just noise. You also have the Nouveau Aficionado who will swear up and down that the vile blended villain has never passed his lips and never will. Certainly one of the most-recognized brands of scotch in the world owned by one of the largest whisky producers in the world and the world’s best-selling scotch brand by almost a factor of 3 (17.6m vs 6.13m cases of Ballantine’s in 2015) Johnnie is no stranger to anyone with passing familiarity with whisky.Ask any modern whisky lover about Walker and you’ll get a reaction similar to the one you’d get in a San Francisco speakeasy if you ask for Bud Light. Big is not cool these days and mass-produced means inauthentic by hipster definition. I can’t pretend to be immune to this way of thinking myself with all my talk of ‘craft’ and the joys of single barrels and tiny producers. In an effort to keep my mind open I’ve reviewed Black Label Platinum Label and now Green Label. (No Red Label… there are limits.)Green Label unlike all of the other Walkers is actually a blended malt composed of (unsubstantiated) 27 different single malts all at least 15 years (or more likely exactly 15 years) of age. The brand was unceremoniously removed from the market in 2012 to make room for Gold and Platinum and has only recently returned to the lineup after a four-year absence. Diageo claims that the recipe has not been altered during this time. Of those 27 malts the recipe reportedly makes use of some key components Caol Ila (from Islay) Talisker (from Skye) Cragganmore (from Speyside) and Linkwood (also Speyside). All – of course – owned by Diageo. The blended (or “vatted”) malt is bottled at 43% ABV and retails for around $45 to $55. My bottle was purchased in 2017 after the renaissance of the label.Update There’s now a Travel Retail (duty free) exclusive version of this that has a different malt profile and more peat Johnnie Walker Island Green.Nose Light and fruity with white peach honey fresh malty grains and graham cracker. Some floral notes are present but hard to pin down – probably from the peated components. Let’s call it gorse because that makes it sound like I know what I’m talking about.Palate Soft and slightly syrupy on the palate. Little tongue burn. Malty cereal notes dominate with a tinge of oat bran. Some of the notes from the aroma are present (honey particularly) but not much fruit. The honey is multi-dimensional the rest is not.Finish Short. Slightly bitter barrel char initially which is joined by vague nougaty nuttiness. Fades quickly with a whimper.With Water A few drops of water release a splash of green apple and unripe banana. The palate is a little spicier and more vibrant as is the finish. I highly recommend a few sparse drops of water with this one.Overall Perspective is an odd thing. Had I just cracked open a bottle of single malt from some barely-known “craft” distillery after getting a good deal on the bottle I would have probably rejoiced at having found a hidden gem with a polished and accomplished (if a little boring) presentation and a fabulous price point. Since this is the ubiquitous Johnnie Walker however my brain says “eh it’s just OK.” Brain be damned this is a very drinkable very available and very well-priced dram. It’s all-malt and it has an age statement to boot. Being picky I have to point out that the palate doesn’t offer much of a surprise the finish is forgettable and the peated components are nearly invisible… but we’re talking about 15 year-old malt for under $50 here.Bottom line If you’re going to drop money on a Walker get this one. Everything “below” Green has clear flaws and everything “above” Green is overpriced. What would Goldilocks do?
264,Johnnie Walker Island Green - Since last week I reviewed a sample of Old Soul Mississippi Bourbon from a generous reader I thought I’d follow that up with a second sample that the aforementioned Generous Reader included in the package. Johnnie Walker Island Green – which should not be confused with Johnnie Walker Green Label – is a travel-retail variant of the Johnnie Walker Green Label bottling. The “Island” here refers to the Scottish isle of Islay not some tropical island. Islay is essentially the opposite of tropical. Like the Green Label this “Green” includes only single malts making it a blended malt scotch whisky instead of just a blended scotch whisky like most Johnnie Walker labels. Those malts are of course all owned by Diageo Caol Ila Clynelish Glenkinchie and Cardhu. Caol Ila makes up the lion’s share thus weighting Island Green more towards Islay peat. This lineup makes the vatting significantly different from the standard Green Label since the only overlap in the recipe is Caol Ila.The vatting is bottled in a 1-liter bottle at an acceptable 43% ABV and probably includes adjusted coloring and is likely chill-filtered. Unlike Green Label this has no age statement so expect the malts included to be younger than 15 years.Island Green was initially intended for Travel Retail exclusivity but since there’s not a lot of international travel going on these days some online outlets are carrying it. Good luck finding it in the States though; you’ll probably have to order a bottle from the UK if you aren’t planning any international travel.I should note that I usually have trouble enjoying blended scotches (even blended malts) that contain peated elements. I find that when you “dilute” peated malts with non-peated malts the smoke elements that remain prominent are the less-subtle cigarette smoke / ashy notes that I’m not crazy about and you lose a lot of the subtlety that make peated single malts so complex and intriguing. I’ve never been a fan of Johnnie Black or Double Black for this reason.Nose Mild peat – dark wet soil – with only a touch of smolder. Hot coals. Mildly sweet malt with sooty cereals and only a very little bit of a floral note (rosewater maybe). Delicate but unmistakably peat-forward.Palate Medium body. First impression is of vanilla cream soda and then a wave of peat crashes turning smoky and earthy. Extremely mild tongue burn.Finish Medium-long. A twinge of honey sets in adding much-needed sweetness and the charcoal notes turn slightly bitter. Fades slowly without evolving.With Water A few drops of water result in a spike of tart aromas (tropical fruit) while taming the peat. These carry through to the finish. This changes a lot – I suggest trying it first without the water and then adding a little to see how it changes for you.Overall A very successful peated blend(ed malt). Usually blends with peat elements go one of two ways Horribly bitter and acrid or exclusively peat-dominated. Island Green manages to straddle the line with enough peat character to remain solidly in the “peated” category while retaining a good balance of malty character and (albeit slight) Highland notes. Quite drinkable.
265,Johnnie Walker Platinum Label (18-year) Blended Scotch - Diageo’s Johnnie Walker range added a Platinum Label to its pantheon of blended scotches in 2013 kicking against the goad of the NAS trend by including an 18 year-old age statement on the label. The blend contains whisky from 20 to 25 distilleries (likely most of them owned by Diageo) and is advertised as having a predominantly Speyside character with some hints of Islay peat. The cynics among you will notice that Diageo removed an 18 year-old product from the market (the old Gold Label) replacing THAT with an NAS blend and then released a more expensive-sounding Platinum bottling at the same age with a higher price tag. Crafty Diageo. Crafty. They are however different blends with different goals. (Gold 18 was sweet and fruity Platinum is dryer more perfumed and smokier.) Apparently Diageo expects you to give Platinum as a gift since it’s more “special” than Black Green or Gold and not stratospheric in price like Blue. I don’t know about you but I’ve never received an $80 bottle of whisky as a gift (except from my parents who know to ask me what I want first!) but I have no doubt that Diageo would like you to start doling out Platinum to your friends family and colleagues.As usual with Diageo and the whisky industry at large there’s plenty little information about the actual makeup of Platinum. It’s bottled at a watery smooth 80 proof (40% ABV) the legal minimum and consists of a blend of grain and malt scotch whiskies that are each at least 18 years of age. That’s… yep that’s it. It’s probably got a bunch of Caol Ila in it some Clynelish and… your guess is as good as mine.Nose Gently perfumed apple blossoms white tea ginger juicy pears and an undercurrent of fresh banana. This smells more like a carefully-crafted perfume than a scotch whisky. The effect is light with no nose tickle and only very faint oak or malt notes. One could be forgiven for thinking this was a pear eau de vie by the aroma alone. After a rest in the glass most of those volatile aromas escape leaving a heavy banana custard note.Palate Medium bodied almost syrupy. Slight tongue burn. A bit of bitter barrel char arrives upfront which is off-putting. The banana reasserts itself along with assorted fruit notes. The oaky bitterness persists. There are some flavors of bakery sweets – banana cream pie comes to mind as do buttered scones. The whole is marred by that weird tannic charry bitter note however.Finish Short. Charcoal apple skins and a fading nutty bitterness like scorched almonds. There is a marzipan note on the tail end of the finish.With Water Several drops of water reawaken the volatile esters in the aroma including the flowers and fruits. The palate becomes somewhat sweeter – like vanilla crème brûlée – but the bitter note remains. There is more sparkle on the finish which seems a little longer. This clearly benefits from the addition of a little water. (But not too much at 40% ABV!) Overall I expected a bit more surface-level quality from a premium Diageo product – usually their whiskies (especially those with age statements) are more polished than this and simply lack depth or complexity. Instead this tastes like the kind of leftover barrel of no-name malt that the independent bottlers pass over and which ends up in a grocery store label bottling. In fact the grain whisky in this blend is (I suspect) what elevates it giving it that syrupy body and some of the lighter fruit-and-flowers notes. It wasn’t until after the fact (I taste whiskies before reading about them when possible) that I realized all that bitter charcoal was actually supposed to be smoky Islay peat which appears to have been lost in translation. I will admit that the whisky has a delicate aroma with an excellent perfumed balance of fruits and flowers and I could certainly pass the time just smelling this whisky. I just didn’t enjoy anything that came after.I would be disappointed to taste this after laying down $80 or more for a bottle. If you’re curious about the Johnnie Walker range try it at a bar.
266,Johnnie Walker Rye Cask Finish (10 year) - Wow I haven’t reviewed a Johnnie Walker since 2012. Although it’s arguably the king of blended scotch the entire brand tends to get ignored by modern whisky enthusiasts looking for authenticity and craftsmanship in a marketplace struggling with the triplet specters of demand for quality demand for transparency and demand for volume. That’s why I was so surprised to taste (and enjoy) the recently-released Rye Cask Finish in the new Johnnie Walker Select Casks line from Diageo; three refreshing things from an unexpected source…and all from Diageo the undisputed king of the mainstream; the kind of place you imagine the phrase “surplus to requirements” and the word “streamlining” coming up a lot.The first in the new Select Casks line Rye Cask Finish is a blended scotch with a heart of Cardhu single malt aged in first-fill American oak casks for at least 10 years and then finished in ex-rye whiskey casks. The result is bottled at 46% ABV. Striking a triumphant balance between massive-scale industrial whisky and small-scale craft mentality Rye Cask Finish is available for only $45 retail. I was able to find it recently at Costco for the phenomenal price of $30!Nose Wakes up a little hot – a few minutes in the glass settle the alcohol and allow for a deeper nosing. A nice round grain-forward profile including breakfast cereal and toasted whole grain bread coconut shavings and molasses. There’s a lot more oaky sweetness (as opposed to malty sweetness) than one usually finds in a blended scotch.Palate Soft and syrupy. Moderate tongue burn which finally recedes into a heavy coconut (like Redbreast 12) oiliness and spicy cinnamon and clove. Finish Medium-long. Drying with some oaky tannins but a larger emphasis on caramel and – dare I say it? Pumpkin spice latte. Fades with a black coffee-like bitterness the one disappointment.With Water Aroma seems unchanged by a few drops of water. The effect on the palate is calmer and brings a touch more sweetness. Water is optional with this one but with the “roughness” of the alcohol bite you might consider proofing it down slightly.Overall An interesting and successful blending of the “sweet and syrupy” effect of Scottish grain whisky with the robust flavor of malt whisky and the spicy/oaky character of those two quintessential American whiskeys bourbon and rye. While most scotch is aged in ex-bourbon casks the first-fill casks chosen for this blend are very prominent in the final product and deliver a wallop of coconut. The finishing in rye casks was equally successful with a sparkling spiciness on the tongue which integrates nicely with the other components. The only down marks come from the splintered finish which starts out promising “pumpkin spice latte” and then goes full “bitter black coffee”. At $45 a reasonable choice. At $30 a steal and a Must Try.
267,Johnny Drum Private Stock Bourbon - Here we have yet another sourced bourbon this time from Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (also known as Willett). Johnny Drum is sold in three expressions an entry-level Green Label ($20) a Black Label with and without an age-statement (12 years) and this Private Stock bottling that lost its 15-year age statement in a rebrand years ago. The usual vague assurances on the Internet that it “still contains some old whisky” are not even backed up by the tried-and-true “a dude at the distillery told me” type of hearsay. It’s probably older than 12 years old (which is what the cheaper Black Label used to have on the label). Probably.As much as I respect the Kulsveen family and the products that come out of Willett (including their new distillate which is awesome) I have a hard time with a sourced bourbon that not only loses its age statements but also can’t be bothered to reveal a mash bill online. All I know is that it’s 101 proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon made… somewhere. Rye percentage? Wheat? No idea.Nose Sappy with a lot of corn syrup elements. Hint of cherry. Deeper in the glass there are some molasses and caramelized sugar notes. Overall the aroma is shy and dry.Palate Medium bodied. The initial wave of cherry juice is followed by an appreciable tongue burn. After there are barrel tannins and a deep roasted hazelnut flavor. Still dry but with more depth than was suggested by the nose. Finish Medium-long. Cherry-flecked corn syrup (cheap pancake syrup) with very minimal charcoal bitterness. Fades without evolving.With Water Several drops of water bring a tart cherry top note to the aroma and brings out a bark-y root-beer note on the palate. Worth experimenting with a little water on this one. And for what it’s worth it makes a perfectly passable Old Fashioned.Overall Other than that surprising hazelnut note in the middle of the palate there isn’t much to be excited about here. The nose is reticent and the flavor profile – while well-balanced and with good depth – is dry and lacks robustness. For the price I’d far rather have Eagle Rare 10 which comes with an age statement and is rounder with more depth of flavor and more sweetness. Johnny Drum is a decent middle-of-the-road bourbon with an overly-optimistic price tag.
268,Jura Superstition - Ahh the NAS debate again. Jura Superstition was one of the first wave of NAS malts whiskies created by combining a single distillery’s output from several different ages without revealing the ages on the bottle. Along with Ardbeg Uigeadail and Aberlour A’Bunadh Superstition stands for the original intention of the category to expand the ability of master blenders to release malts that showcase what’s best about a brand by allowing them to use young malt for intensity and fresh fruit and floral notes and older malt for balance and depth. With an NAS expression a distillery doesn’t have to try to sell something that has a price befitting its average age of say 15 years with a label that (by law) only reveals the youngest malt in the vatting – perhaps 5 years. It’s a laudable goal but fraught with potential for abuse. Any old profit-driven distillery (cough) with an eye towards gouging the current spike in whisky popularity could release an $80 bottling of primarily young malt without any kind of legal backlash. In fact when Compass Box recently tried to flip the system and release an NAS blend with the age of all of the components prominently displayed it was slapped with threats of litigation. The NAS market is certainly one where the buyer must beware.Superstition is Jura’s house malt but heavily peated (although the bottle says “lightly” peated I would lump it in with fully peated malts like Laphroaig and Talisker) and aged in ex-bourbon casks. It’s quite reasonably priced at $50 – $60 which is the new $40 didn’t you know?Nose Strong iodine-flecked peat. Briny and heavily suggestive of the sea (not smoke). Reminds me of expanses of brown seaweed slowly aging (rotting) on a sea spray-buffeted beach. After a rest in the glass one can pick out notes of sandalwood vanilla and caramel although they are faint.Palate Moderately creamy body. Some tongue burn is followed by salty peat with notes of black pepper. A light malt sweetness pervades but is just sweet enough to balance the salt/peat.Finish Of medium length. More of the same notes (salty peat). A hint of citrus creeps in as the peat fades along with sweet Key lime. Pleasant.With Water A few drops of water temper the peat releasing notes of salted caramel and vanilla. The same notes appear on the tongue improving the overall balance of the malt (unless you just love seaweed).Overall First I highly recommend water with this. Water turns a one-dimensional oceanic peat show into a well-balanced orchestra of peat and oak and caramelized malt. Quite tasty and more accessible (especially with water) than other peated standards like Laphroaig 10 and the pretty similar Talisker 10. At only a $10 premium over younger (unpeated) sibling Jura 10 it’s a no-brainer. If you’ve never had Jura or were worried about the possibility of an NAS scam this is a solid Must Try.
269,Kaiyō Japanese Mizunara Oak - Oof. This one is painful. I’m not a big consumer of Japanese whisky mostly because the international fervor and subsequent pricing mania for Japanese whisky struck before I got into it. If I wasn’t buying Yamazaki and Nikka at $40 I’m definitely not buying them above $100. I do have a soft spot for the now-discontinued Hibiki 12 year (and the 17 year which is even better) but in general my brief forays into Japanese whisky haven’t been very exciting.So when my favorite retailer David Driscoll sung the praises of a new Japanese whisky to hit the US market with a trick to keep prices in check (yes $70 is “in check” for Japanese whisky) I was sold. I was doubly sold when I learned that the whisky had been aged in that most legendary of oak species Japanese Mizunara Oak.First the specs Kaiyō is a “negotiant” (independent bottler) from Hong Kong that purchases barrels of aged or unaged whisky from Japanese producers and matures and bottles them under the Kaiyō label much like Gordon & MacPhail or Alexander Murray. In this case the barrels are single malt whisky from an unnamed Japanese distillery that have been “teaspooned” with whisky from another distillery. In other words a technical “blend”. This is a fairly standard industry practice in Scotland and elsewhere and is done as a legal precaution to protect the name (and reputation) of the original distiller. This is why the Kaiyō bottle label says “Whisky” not “Single Malt Whisky”.There’s no age information available. All we know is that the whisky was aged in Mizunara oak barrels from Ariake and then finished maturation for “up to 3 months” on a boat somewhere like those Jefferson “Ocean Aged” boondoggles. The fact that the whisky was not aged 100% of the time in Japan is the reason “Japanese whisky” doesn’t appear on the label. This plus the teaspooning is what purportedly keeps the price low relatively speaking.The Internet has a lot of fascinating conspiracy theories about the origins of Kaiyō (this is a particularly well-researched one which also suggests the whisky is aged for 3 years in Mizunara before its ocean voyage). The brand has a future as well a distillery building is in the works. I would be more interested in digging into this kind of mystery if I liked the whisky… at all.Kaiyō Mizunara Oak is not chill-filtered and bottled at 43% ABV. There is also a cask-strength version.Nose Rotting wood wet moss engine grease burnt caramel without the sweetness. A rest in the glass does not improve the situation. There isn’t even the barest hint of sandalwood but if you’re a fan of noxious incense that smells like burning rubber then yes this probably smells like incense.Palate Medium body. Mild tongue burn (hotter than expected for 43% ABV). This tastes very much like bottom-shelf cheap blended Scotch whisky with a top note of burning tires and acetone.Finish Unmercifully long. The primary flavor is vodka the cheap kind. This is awful.With Water A few drops of water amp up the nose tickle but fix nothing. A rest in the glass however adds a perfumed floral note that is welcome but cannot by itself save this whisky. If you are cursed with a bottle of this and cannot give it away I suggest waiting until you are good and drunk already adding a small splash of water to a glass letting it sit for 5 to 10 minutes and then attempting to enjoy it.Overall Oh God I wanted to like this I really did. I gave it several tastings spread across several weeks in the hope that it would grow on me. It didn’t. It’s vile. It bears no resemblance to my (admittedly distant) memory of Mizunara oak. It contains no notes that even come close to sandalwood. It tastes exactly like I would expect a grocery-store label of $10/liter blended scotch to taste if it had been contaminated by motor oil. Without a doubt the worst use of $70 ever. I finally managed to rid myself of the bottle by hand-blending it with some leftover peated single malt scotch which covered up some of the worst offenses.I sincerely hope David never sees this review. Normally his tastes and mine align. Perhaps I got a bad bottle. Perhaps some quirk of the whisky made it “turn” while sitting on my shelf before I opened it. Whatever it is these are the risks we take when we buy whisky. Thank goodness I can count the number of truly “bad” bottles I’ve bought on one hand.
270,Kentucky Owl Straight Rye (11 year) - So I know I said I wouldn’t do this. I said I don’t review whisky that costs (much) more than $100. I don’t like supporting that end of the market and I don’t think my readers are very likely to be interested in those bottles. Plus there are a number of very excellent blogs that cover high-end whisky all of them better than I could do it. Also I can’t afford the bottles. Mostly it’s the last one. Still when a quarter-full bottle of super-limited $140 rye lands in my lap I don’t even look at the horse’s mouth let alone into it.So apparently a brand called Kentucky Owl Bourbon was sold from 1879 through Prohibition and the business failed when its whisky was seized by the government for impounding (a common occurrence at the outset of Prohibition when distilled spirits would be redistilled for industrial purposes or sold in small quantities for medical use). There’s a story about a warehouse fire and Al Capone… the sort of thing that looks good on a whisky website and is impossible to corroborate. It’s also irrelevant except that the great-great-grandson of the founder of Kentucky Owl has re-launched the brand with sourced whiskey and an absolutely gorgeous label. A series of bourbons and this single rye comprise the current portfolio.There’s not a ton of actual info available. The whiskey is from a batch of barrels of 11 year-old straight rye whiskey acquired from an unnamed distillery (or distilleries?) in Kentucky and then bottled in Bardstown Kentucky at a robust 55.3% ABV which was lowered from the original full cask-strength (I’ve heard above 65%). My bottle is from Batch No. 01 and was bottled in July of 2017. The edition was released in 25 states in September of 2017 and sold out basically immediately. This is what putting a number on your bottles gets you people. Apparently part of the craze is due to the highly-limited nature of the brand’s previous seven releases (all bourbon most available only in Kentucky and all from very small bottling runs) although the rye is the largest release to date with 7500 bottles.Internet gossip suggests this might have been made at the Barton distillery which is where some of High West‘s older rye components are sourced. There are other possibilities however.Nose Delectable. Deep resinous notes of stewed pears fresh apple cider balsamic vinegar dripping pine sap oaky sugars raw cacao and mace (the spice not the self-defense spray). A rest in the glass collects dense caramel and toffee notes. This is one of those bouquets that keeps on giving – every time you pick up the glass you are struck by something different.Palate Thin body. Woodsy like hemlock forests or redwood needles crushing underfoot. A current of maraschino cherries washes through right before a wave of cinnamon red-hots and numbing tongue burn wash it away. Despite the high ABV the tongue burn is only moderate. Less complex than the aroma but still deep and intense spicy and dry.Finish Long. Black cherries wood varnish concentrated resinous wood sugars (balsamico again). A moderate amount of barrel char without the bitterness and a fading note of fresh cranberry. Dry overall and not quite as successful as the aroma.With Water Several drops of water mute the aroma somewhat increasing the impression of dryness. There is added meatiness or nuttiness on the tongue like roasted chestnuts and the finish is fuller and rounder. Try this first without water and then with… but only a little bit.Overall Despite the slightly disappointing finish this is what I look for in a well-aged rye. Concentrated oak woodsy pine or eucalyptus jammy stone fruits and unusual spices. Deep contemplative and powerful. If only it wasn’t so limited and so damn expensive. I’d be excited to buy this for $80 a bottle. $140? I don’t think so. Still I challenge you to find a 10-year or older rye at a reasonable proof that isn’t wildly overpriced. There just isn’t much of the stuff to go around. If the price tag doesn’t scare you off it’s tasty juice. For that reason I’m giving this a “Recommended” rating. If there were other old ryes available for less money that would be a different story.
271,Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey - Note Due to some recent comments I’m going to have to start leading off every “low end” whiskey review with this note. I understand that this is a blend and that it is intended for mixing not analyzing in comparison to fine single-malts and other high-end whiskies. However as I do not mix cocktails and I do enjoy some inexpensive whiskies straight I am going to proceed with this review as if I’m contemplating its merit as a low-end sipper.Kilbeggan is one of those ubiquitous bottles that you see on market shelves in the Irish Whiskey section but always pass by in favor of the well-known options (like Jameson) or the lesser-known “insider” whiskies like Redbreast or a single malt from Cooley’s. There actually is a Kilbeggan distillery which was mothballed in 1957 and much later re-opened as a whiskey museum. Irish whiskey company Cooley bought the rights to the brand name and began producing Kilbeggan at its own facility which means the bottles on the shelves are blended Cooley Irish whiskey. However in 2007 the company also refurbished the old distillery and in 2010 began producing whiskey at the old site again. This product will be available starting in 2014. I intend to review it again at that time.The current Kilbeggan is a blend of Cooley grain whiskey and malt whiskey. This differentiates it from other Irish blends like Jameson and Powers which contain Irish single pot-still whiskey instead of just malt. Kilbeggan is aged for at least 3 years (or “sometimes longer”) in ex-bourbon barrels at the warehouse at the old Kilbeggan site.Nose Clean scent. Very grain-y with the usual lineup of cereals powdered sugar and freshly-baked bread. While not particularly hot at the baseline 40% ABV there is a pronounced nose tickle. Some high notes appear raspberry? green apple? But they are transient.Palate Thin body with only a hint of pot-still bulk. Tongue burn is minimal although it lasts for awhile. Not much in the way of flavor is revealed a repeat of the cereal notes and that slightly unpleasant “wide-cut” effect vaguely reminiscent of the scent of turpentine.Finish Medium-length. Green apple again and a slight woody nuttiness. Not unpleasant for an inexpensive whiskey but there are no stand-out flavors.With Water A generous splash of water reveals a nice banana taffy tang on the nose with heightened vanilla notes. The body is unaffected and is considerably smoother (no surprise there it’s diluted) but is somehow also more soft and no longer has that vodka/turpentine quality. The banana taffy is repeated on the finish. I heartily recommend dosing this with a little water.Overall This like Jameson is an eminently drinkable Irish whiskey. I feel that Jameson has a little more to offer in the way of fruit notes and character. For my money (and especially if I’m drinking it straight) I’ll stick to Jameson. I am however excited to try the whiskey now being produced at the rejuvenated original distillery. The “Not Recommended” rating is due to the minimal flavor and the fact that Jameson is probably a better buy.
272,Kilchoman 100% Islay 3rd Edition - Kilchoman as a distillery project has continuously focused on what ‘craft’ really means in the production of whisky. With careful attention to every step of the process and every ingredient in the mix Kilchoman manages to produce exceptionally high-quality malt at a very young age. It very well may be that attention to detail that permits them to sell (and sell out of) 5 year-old malt for $90 a bottle. For the third time Kilchoman has released a bottling of whisky made 100% from barley grown malted distilled and bottled on the distillery property. That’s huge! Talk about “farm to table” – this is “farm to bottle” and it really shines.Bottled at a hefty 50% ABV (100 proof) the 3rd edition consists of a vatting of four and five year-old malts from ex-bourbon barrels.Nose Elegantly smoky elements of brushfire and straight wood smoke. A hint of roasting meats but otherwise very clean lean and smoke-centric. There’s also a stark minerality like the smell of sparkling mineral water.Palate Soft. Even at 100 proof the tongue burn is only moderate. Delicate strands of oatmeal sea brine and fresh ripe barley. The grain (normally a bad word) element is pure and is only the second time I’ve ever thought of barley in terms of terroir (the other was Bruichladdich Bere Barley).Finish Long. A surprisingly sweet wave of barley. Still exceedingly clean and lithe. Finishes with vanilla-tinged woodsmoke and no bitterness.With Water A splash of water gives the nose more sweetness which pairs well with the woodsmoke. The palate is a little washed out but the finish is unchanged. I think I prefer this with the water.Overall While this lacks some of the depth and roundness of the Machir Bay the strength of Kilchoman is the pure expression of smoke and barley without many distractions. The nose is pure wood smoke and the palate laser-focused barley. Only on the finish does the malt get a little playful and introduce sweetness and vanilla. A study in purity but not complex enough to warrant heavy contemplation.For $85 this is a “Recommended” but with reservations. Kilchoman is still not quite “there” for me yet at least not $85 “there”. However the terroir of the grain that comes through here is something truly special and arguably justifies the price.
273,Kilchoman 2007 Vintage - I’ve reviewed a few Kilchoman malts before and I’m finally starting to come around especially after Machir Bay. For a fledgling distillery Kilchoman has had amazing success at selling young malt for big dollars and it’s not a fluke. Young Kilchoman is on the whole just so damn well made.This bottling the 2007 vintage at 46% ABV is a vatting of 6 year-old barrels all from ex-bourbon casks. Thanks go to Katia at ImpEx Beverages for the sample.Nose A distinct grassy vegetal aroma – new make – greets the nose at first. Celery salt mown grass etc. The usual Islay smoke is subdued but present.Palate Thin body but a nice agave-like sweetness pervades. Little to no tongue burn (amazing for 46% ABV at this young age). The smoke (wood smoke and grass) is in the background and elements of (very good) tequila keep coming to the front with nopales vanilla and slight buttery oak.Finish Medium-long. The smoke becomes more of a factor and the “new make” character is gone. A little meaty a little nutty and something briny. Altogether light but crisp.With Water If anything the water accentuates the tequila/cactus notes. It adds a little sweetness and vanilla on the palate and finishes with a little more nuttiness to the smoke. Still I’d consider water optional with this one.Overall This release has a lot more “new make” in it than something like the 100% Islay 3rd Edition or the Machir Bay. The effect though is of good tequila rather than bad moonshine. (Buffalo Trace new make for example is downright awful). The smoke is present but subdued and the barley shines through. It comes across like the 100% Islay 3rd edition as very lean and sparse without the dizzying array of complexity usually associated with briny Islay malts like Laphroaig. Still considering the age this is whisky craftsmanship at its best and adds to the growing volume of literature that says that Kilchoman at 10 years of age (or more) will be a force to be reckoned with.I’m rating it a “Try before Buy” because $80 is a lot to drop even on Kilchoman and Machir Bay is (in my mind) better and cheaper.
274,Kilchoman Machir Bay - Kilchoman. I was skeptical. After a year of overpriced underaged malt that I referred to as “new distillery charity” my local champion of all things Kilchoman (David D. at K&L) managed to sell out an entire shipment of Machir Bay Kilchoman’s new NAS and first “permanent” bottling… in one day. OK I thought maybe there’s something to this Kilchoman business. I took the plunge and bought a bottle of Machir Bay when David got his second shipment. He was kind enough to also let me sample some of the newly-arrived K&L Exclusive 5 year-old Kilchoman single-cask (from a Sherry butt). According to the distillery Machir Bay is a vatting of 3- 4- and 5 year-old peated malt (aged in ex-bourbon) which has finished for just 8 weeks in sherry butts. In accordance with Kilchoman’s craft attitudes Machir Bay is bottled at 46% ABV without coloring or chill-filtration. Score one for the little guys – this stuff is exactly as good as it was cracked up to be and totally worth the $54 price tag (at last!).Color Very light straw.Nose The first impression is of unmistakably Islay peat and white chocolate. Faint florals -lavender?- twine with the lemony slightly acidic peat. Not particularly smoky or earthy but ethereal and vegetal. Like a pile of freshly-mown hay and flowers just starting to smoulder. The heat of its 46% ABV is detectable but not offensive. Decidedly subtle for a fully peated malt. After a rest in the glass I can detect juicy peach which might come from the ever-so-brief sherry finish.Palate Thin body. Lemon in waves upfront with a background of vanilla frosting. After the slight (very slight!) burn subsides there are ample waves of grain (hehehe) a faint layer of fresh strawberries and fruit punch and a continuous high note of (hay) peat.Finish Long. Somehow avoids being bitter despite all the phenol. A moment of lavender honey followed by dry bark lemon peel oil and spent charcoal.With Water A few drops of water cause the peat to begin smoking. Tobacco freshly-squeezed lemon juice and crushed mint. The palate is much sweeter with crumbly snickerdoodle cookies vanilla extract and banana cream pie. This malt is undeniably improved by the addition of water!Overall Subtle and accomplished if light. The peat is masterfully understated and plays beautifully with the naturally sweet lemon honey and floral elements. Don’t let the ‘light’ moniker distract from the fact that this is very highly peated malt with far more subtlety than say Laphroaig but a lot more power and sinus-burning peat than Highland Park. It does very much stand alone among the Islay malts though being light and playful but also masterful and persuasive. Very impressive for a malt with an average age significantly under 5 years. I’ve made this a “Must Have” whisky for peat-lovers you can’t miss the revolution in Islay whiskies and now you don’t have to pay charity prices for it!For what it’s worth K&L’s 5 year-old sherry cask is a different animal entirely. At cask-strength and with a pungent resinous personality it’s some big whisky. Candle wax burning balsamic reduction dried cranberries and smoggy industrially earthy peat. It tastes somewhat like elegant masterful cask-strength Islay peated malt stored in a volatile sherry cask – somehow dark resinous and fungal and also acidic and brightly fruity. In places the sherry overwhelms the peat. This is definitely not mainstream whisky and its internal contradictions take some analysis to appreciate. For fun I splashed a bit into my glass of Machir Bay and was rewarded with an elevated level of fruitiness that played very nicely with the peat. There’s a whisky cocktail for you – 3 parts Kilchoman Machir Bay to 1 part K&L Sherry Cask Kilchoman neat. Too bad K&L’s cask runs $110 a bottle. Too rich for my blood in more ways than one!
275,Kilchoman Sanaig - Upstart farm distillery Kilchoman has added a new single malt to its permanent portfolio next to one of my favorites Machir Bay. Kilchoman specializes in pristine craft peated malt that is remarkable for being excellent at a young age – like 3 or 4 years young. Like Machir Bay this is partially sherry-aged. In Sanaig’s case it’s an extra 10 months of aging in oloroso sherry casks. The marketing materials describe it as being “predominantly” aged in sherry which is unlikely. More likely they mean the vatting is “predominantly” oloroso-finished casks with the remainder being ex-bourbon. That’s just my guess.Sanaig named after some inlet or other geographical feature near the distillery (seriously does anyone really care about this stuff anymore?) is bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added color a classical craft presentation.Thanks as always to ImpEx for the sample thus saving me from having to cram yet another full-sized bottle on my shelf.Nose Black pepper charcoal strong woodsy peat. Deeper in there are persistent notes of chalk lime peel ozone and seltzer. Initially I had trouble identifying any sherry notes at all. After a rest in the glass there are some jammy berry flavors.Palate Thin body. Not too much tongue burn. Elegant with wisps of campfire smoke fresh-cracked grains and refined sugar. Again it took a few tries to identify the sherry character which is similar to the aroma.Finish Long. Bordering on savory like fire-charred seafood with a spritz of lime juice. Dried berries cocoa powder. Ends with dry peat and mouth-drying oak tannins.With Water A few drops of water initially dampen the aroma but give it a few minutes and there’s kefir lime and shortbread cookies. The finish also becomes more sparkling and is slightly tart.Overall An elegant if straightforward peated malt with an odd sense of sherry being totally in the background. It’s not quite as exciting to me as the Machir Bay was with its balance of aloof Kilchoman peat and vibrant fruit-forward sherry. Here we have a peated malt as if washed of all its impurities and given a few drops of tincture-of-sherry extract. It smells like clean laundry with a background of scrubbed peat smoke from a molecular gastronomy lab and tastes like fresh mineral water with freshly-cracked grains dabbed with berry coulis. For my money I prefer Machir Bay although I have a feeling that a full bottle of this would grow on me. If you already like Kilchoman this is a Recommended. If not try the Machir Bay first. Especially because the Machir Bay is $15 cheaper.
276,Kilchoman Spring 2011 - Kilchoman is both an exciting new trend in craft whisky and a fundraising PR stunt on a massive scale. Call me cynical but I don’t personally appreciate being asked to pay unreal prices – arguably a form of charity in this case – to support the future production of quality whisky. This sentiment may make me unpopular with other whisky writers (who seem to unilaterally sing the praises of the new distillery’s super-young products) but I just don’t think the young peated malt is good enough to command these prices.The very valid arguments in favor of Kilchoman’s capitalization strategy are that by selling young whisky and high prices they are supporting the distillation and aging of much better products for everyone to enjoy in the future. In addition the seasonally-released malts have become collectors’ items and will no doubt grace auction halls for years to come.Don’t get me wrong. The 3 year-old malt I got to try at K&L a few weeks ago showed massive promise and a very clear crisp and tasty style. There’s no doubt in my mind that this whisky will be explosive when it reaches 8 or 10 years old. But $60 a bottle? For that I can get a complex established mature Islay like Lagavulin 16 (well almost) or Laphroaig Quater-Cask. Maybe I’m lacking an altruistic gene but there’s something about the overt (if well-intentioned) money-grab that leaves a bad taste in my mouth… and it isn’t peat.On the upside for those willing to shell out the dough (or wait like the rest of us) we’re looking at a craft presentation (46% ABV unchilfiltered and no color added) peated malt from a distillery that grows AND malts its own barley. With responsible farming expert whiskymaking careful maturation and an ongoing worldwide craze for anything Islay I’d say that Kilchoman has a bright future.The Spring 2011 release that I tried is a vatting of 3 and 4 year-old whisky aged in first-fill bourbon casks plus a partial finishing (only 5 weeks) in oloroso sherry butts (making it “officially” 3 years old). Peated to a whopping 50 PPM.Nose Blast of salty peat smoked pork and lemongrass. Not heavy on the smoke but more earthy and bright and slightly vegetal. Pleasant and bracing.Palate Light body but relatively smooth on the tongue. More waves of bright young vibrant peat. Mossy and dusty. No fruit that I can detect.Finish Long continuing the bright peat which turns lemony then herbal lozenge. Not even a touch of bitterness. Very nice.Overall This shows a LOT of promise but it’s only really promise at this point. If this were a finished NAS product I’d price it around $40 a bottle on the competitive Islay market. As it is though it’s more of a showpiece or a collector’s item than a drinkable bottle. At around $60 a bottle you should only pay this price if you’re a diehard Islay fan a collector or consider supporting new distilleries a form of charity. I for one will be anxiously awaiting the first 10 year-old official bottling… in 2016.
277,Kirkland Highland Sherry Cask Finish – 18 year - Every time Costco gets in a new Alexander Murray bottling of unnamed single malt for unbelievable prices (which seems to be about every 4 months recently) I get a flurry of emails asking for a review. It’s no wonder – while the Kirkland-Alexander Murray duo has performed excellently in the past with several releases with very high quality-to-price ratios it’s still hard to believe that they can keep doing it. In an industry where filling contracts are locked down whisky stocks are drying up like California reservoirs and “all the good casks” have long since been bottled and sold how does Alexander Murray put out Costco-sized allocations of 18 and 20 year-old single malt (good single malt!) for $35 a pop? I have no earthly idea. Surely they’ll be forced by market conditions to release a dud right? Or set the price above the value of the liquid?If you are a budget-minded single malt lover who has a local Costco that sells whisky (depending on your state) you can rest assured that the latest release is (still) worth your money. For how much longer? Who knows.Like the previous Speyside Sherry Cask Finish at 18 years of age this one gives no hint to the distillery source aside from the “Highland” designation. Considering that the entirety of Speyside is technically inside the “Highlands” and that some distilleries located in Speyside routinely put “Highland” on their labels this is less than useful information. Also like the previous release this one was “finished” in Sherry casks which implies that it spent most of its maturation period in ex-bourbon. Even at 40% ABV a sherry-finished 18 year-old malt for $38 is an impressive feat.Nose Very Floral. Elderflower dilute cranberry juice a hint of candle wax. Orange-blossom honey and a note of heather that reminds me of some of the ex-bourbon-cask Balvenies. Elegant slightly tart and with excellent florals. On the lighter side (for a sherried malt) but quite surprisingly nice.Palate Somewhat waxy. Tart fruity notes of fresh berries. Vanilla pound cake some blonde fudge. A bit one-dimensional but pleasant.Finish The slightest peat mossy and a little herbal. this fades into hazelnut butter and echoes of the berries from earlier. Absolutely without bitterness.With Water A few drops of water yield a little stonefruit and a little more maltiness. Really this is already watered to its limit and doesn’t need any more especially with the already-present florals on the nose.Overall This is a fabulous malt for $38. Tasted blind I’d have said it was worth at least $60 and these days an age statement of 18 will net you a minimum of $100. Well done Alexander Murray. Well done. I could wish for a little higher ABV to provide some bite but for straight sipping this is correctly watered.While this is totally a shot in the dark the waxy notes make me think this could be sherry-finished Clynelish. Again wild conjecture – let me know what you think in the comments.Note The “Must Have” rating refers to my recommendation that if you have a Costco that sells liquor and they stock this product you won’t be sorry for dropping $38 on a bottle or two. It’s certainly worth the price. That said it’s not so spectacular that it’s worth driving across state lines or conning friends into mailing you a bottle… that effort would invalidate the point This is good whisky for a GREAT price.
278,Kirkland Small Batch Bourbon – 7 year - Kirkland (Costco’s brand name) has been offering up some substantial values in quality single-malt scotch over the last few years. I decided that their track record warranted trying out the American whisky side of the aisle so I plopped down my $20 for a liter of “Premium Small Batch” Kentucky Straight Bourbon at 7 years of age and an impressive 103 proof. It’s from batch B-5183 if it matters. The label indicates that it was made in Clermont which leaves no doubt as to its distiller – the Beam Corporation’s Jim Beam Clermont Distillery. Hoping that this was a 7-year batch of the company’s Knob Creek product (which I’ve enjoyed in the past and will be reviewing soon) I cracked open the bottle to see what kind of bourbon one gets for $20 a liter at Costco.Right away I could tell. This was not Knob Creek. This was Jim Beam and no question about it. Jim has a very specific flavor and aroma profile which has no doubt been “crafted” over the decades to “perfection” but which comes across to me as a vaguely vegetal light-in-character nail polish remover. Eugh. I never liked the stuff in college and it’s certainly not to my taste now.Nose Light brown sugar a bare hint of acetone (nail polish remover) which reminds me instantly of Jim Beam. Less oak and less caramel than comparable bourbons. No detectable cherry element. Some raw corn and light corn syrup candies (caramel corn). The alcohol is somewhat biting.Palate A little syrupy but with a rough tongue burn. Some astringency but without the woody flavors that come with older bourbon. Now there’s a bit of cherry (lozenge) and some hay notes. Still light on the sugar (no molasses) and rough on the palate.Finish Medium long. A little oak and more caramel corn. Forgettable.With Water A few drops of water don’t do anything to elevate the aroma perhaps instead accentuating the nail polish remover. If you’re drinking this neat water isn’t going to make much difference except perhaps by proofing it down to tame the burn.Overall Unlike most Kirkland labelled booze I’m severely underwhelmed by this one. It’s obviously Jim Beam but I don’t think it comes from the recipe used to make Knob Creek (which was my hope) and instead seems to be slightly younger Jim Beam Black. I would not recommend this for drinking neat. It makes a passable cocktail (and $20 a liter isn’t a bad price) but you’d do much (much) better with a bottle of Knob Creek Small Batch which is superior in basically every way. If you’re a Jim Beam lover though and looking for a value bottle this should suit.
279,Kirkland Speyside Sherry Cask Finish – 18 year - I’ve had a lot of requests recently to review this whisky. It’s an old problem with the whisky market. You wander into a store like Costco notice they sell whisky (depending on your state) and your eye settles on this beauty. Nice label respectable age statement… but what is it? An 18 year-old single-malt for $33… is that a joke? Are there cameras hidden behind the metal warehouse racks? It can’t be good for $33. How is a casual consumer to know?There’s no answer to this question – unless you happen to have a smartphone (and can get signal inside that concrete box) and can find a reputable online review to read you’re on your own. So if you’re standing in a Costco right now on your smartphone and you’re willing to believe that I’m a reputable reviewer you’re in luck! The answer to your question is Yes! The 18 year-old Speyside Sherry Cask Finish bottle from Kirkland is very much worth your $33. It may or may not be from The Macallan (note that it’s finished in sherry casks after mostly aging in ex-bourbon barrels not totally aged in ex-sherry like Macallan 18) it may not be around for more than a few months but it is definitely a quality dram for very little money. Here’s my advice Buy a bottle take it home and crack it open and taste it. Then go back to the store and buy two more.This is bottled by Independent Bottler Alexander Murray & Co. which has previously performed the same service for other Kirkland-brand scotch such as the defunct 20-year Speyside Sherry Cask Finish. After tasting both I venture to say that despite the $10 cheaper price the 18 may actually be slightly better than the 20 although they are VERY similar and almost certainly hail from the same distillery. My only gripe is that the bottle is a weak 40% ABV but that’s a pale complaint considering the value here.Nose Clear sherry nose – fresh fig black cherry nice levels of butterscotch and particularly well balanced. It doesn’t have that armchair leather and concentrated woody aroma of Macallan 18 but it smells like what it is – 18 year-old ex-bourbon finished in sherry. The level of sweetness is just right.Palate Moderate weight maybe slightly on the thin side. Aroma notes continue to the palate – cherry lozenge prune caramel or butterscotch. A nice maltiness emerges after a few seconds a reminder of barley grains.Finish A nice woody twist echoes of the black fruits with some final wisps of mint and slightly acrid smoke like an extinguished cigar. Mild bitterness.With Water A few drops of water makes the nose very brambly – blackberry leaves and nettle. Increased burn on the palate and amped-up smoke on the finish. I’d skip the water here.Overall This actually bears more resemblance to Glenfiddich 15 than Macallan 18. There’s none of that deep dank resinous fruit or mouth-coating sticky toffee. Instead there’s a delicate balance of nice fresh black berries with the standard hallmarks of ex-bourbon aging (namely the butterscotch/caramel note that I can never pin down). It’s a well-constructed malt with no obvious flaws (except for a lack of weight on the palate). In a blind test I would say this was a $60 malt. That makes this one hell of a deal especially if sherry finishes are your thing. $33? I’ll take two.Note The “Must Have” rating refers to my recommendation that if you have a Costco that sells liquor and they stock this product you won’t be sorry for dropping $33 on a bottle or two. It’s certainly worth the price. That said it’s not so spectacular that it’s worth driving across state lines or conning friends into mailing you a bottle… that effort would invalidate the point This is good whisky for a GREAT price.
280,Kirkland Speyside Sherry Cask Finish – 20 year - We’ve been seeing a lot of this sort of thing recently from independent bottler Alexander Murray & Co. who also bottled the Trader Joe’s unlabelled Speyside 18 single malt. The oddity here is that Kirkland’s (Costco’s) own-label bottlings of sherry-aged whisky are always Macallan and they always say so. This one doesn’t. Online speculation states this is proof that it’s not Macallan and is instead some lesser-known distillery like Mortlach or Longmorn – something your average Costco shopper would pass by. After putting off a purchase for several months and totally missing the bandwagon I finally caved in to the siren song of old whisky for low price and invested in a bottle.The first thing that struck me on the label is that it says the whisky was aged in “Oak casks for 20 years and then finished in sherry casks” for an undisclosed amount of time. Since all whisky is aged in oak casks the first statement isn’t very helpful. It should be clear though that this was not aged for 20 years in ex-sherry. That means it likely spent that time in ex-bourbon casks or possibly reconditioned (scraped and re-toasted) barrels. This is a departure from Macallan’s Sherry Oak line (10 12 18 and 25 year-old official bottlings) which are aged exclusively in sherry not just finished in it. If this IS Macallan then Alexander Murray & Co. did something very un-Macallan to it. Maybe that’s why Macallan doesn’t want their name on it?Update 5 years later Another 20 year-old sherried Speysider this time at 46% in 2018…Color Dark amber. Considering the aging process described that means it’s almost certainly colored.Nose Unmistakable sherry. Some bright red fruits – currant – on top of a deep nutty layer of well-rounded malt. By God this smells like Macallan. There is a distinct lack of rancio leather or other telling characteristics of long-term sherry maturation which is consistent with the idea that the malt was in ex-bourbon (or perhaps reconditioned refill sherry casks) for the lion’s share of its age. That makes it pointless to compare to Macallan’s official bottling range so drinkers of The Macallan 18 will be disappointed to find this isn’t “as good”. However from the nose alone this seems like an excellent malt in its own right. The bright fresh red fruits pop and the mature malt provides a nutty and not overly-sweet backdrop.Palate On the tame side. The fruit here is dried and somewhat dusty and there are hints of tobacco white pepper and sappy oak. It just doesn’t go anywhere.Finish Medium-short. Fruit jam up front fading into walnut meats fruitcake and fig paste. A tinge of charcoal and faint oak tannin – not quite bitter. This doesn’t linger like a GlenDronach or an OB Macallan but it is straightforward pleasant and inoffensive.With Water A few drops of water don’t seem to me to make much difference. At 40% this doesn’t need any further dilution.Overall My personal theory is that because this is a malt matured in non-sherry for 20 years and then finished in sherry The Macallan did not want to tarnish their brand image by allowing Kirkland to name the distillery on the bottle and confuse drinkers accustomed to Macallan’s all-sherry all-the-time house style. If you associate old sherried malts with notes of leather rancio resin and concentrated fruit reductions (like I do) you will be hard-pressed to reconcile the flavors here – excellent though they might be – with the phrases “sherry cask” and “aged 20 years” on the bottle. It might be more helpful to think of this as a 20 year-old ex-bourbon Speysider with a top-dressing of sherry finish à la Glenmorangie’s Lasanta.Bottom-line This is 20 year-old malt whisky with no major flaws for under $50. That’s unheard-of especially in today’s overheated scotch market. If your wallet is hurting from the price hikes on official bottlings of your favorite scotches and you don’t mind a slight downgrade in quality in your value malts then I recommend grabbing a bottle while it’s still available. Then grab another one after you’ve tasted it. If this thing had The Macallan name on it it’d be at least $100. If it was actually official Macallan it’d be $200. Tasting blind it’s worth at least $60.Note The “Must Try” rating refers to my recommendation that you buy a bottle if you’re on the fence since you’re not likely to find a way to taste it before buying. It’s certainly worth the price.
281,Kirkland Speyside Sherry Cask Finish – 20 year (2018) - I have been neglecting my local Costco. There was a time a few years ago when I would monthly wander into that big-box jungle and see what fruits I could extract. Their prices on industry standards like Oban 14 and Lagavulin 16 have been admittedly uninspired on my last few visits which might account for the waning of my interest. This weekend I noticed a new version of the 2013 classic Kirkland (Costco’s brand) has a new version of its 20 year-old Speyside single-malt with a sherry cask finish (link to the last one I reviewed in 2013 here). As before this is bottled by those big-box contact maestros Alexander Murray & Co. from a mystery distillery in Speyside. The whisky in question was aged for the majority of its life in ex-bourbon and then finished (possibly by Murray & Co.) for only 6 months in Oloroso sherry and bottled at 46% ABV. (Not 40% this time! Yay!)This bottle retails for $58 a thirteen-dollar premium over its 40% ABV 2013 predecessor that is actually pretty tame considering the other increases over the last half decade. Example Glenfiddich 18 was $44 in 2011 (!!!!) and is now $70-something at the same store. Yowch.There is a wild raging debate on the Internet about the actual source of Alexander Murray & Co.’s big-age low-price malts. Some rumors suggest that the majority of the company’s barrels come from Tullibardine (a whisky chameleon of sorts) while the company has definitely bottled Macallan before and is reported to have contracts with both Diageo and Edrington. Rumors persist as well of Longmorn and Mortlach and I swear I’ve tasted Alexander Murray juice that was the spitting image of a Mortlach in the past. As usual though there is no certainty about the provenance of this bottle and isn’t that really half the fun anyway? Aside from getting a 50% discount on 20 year-old malt of course.As I opened this bottle I whispered a prayer to the whisky gods “Please let this be Mortlach…”Nose Distinct dried fruit notes – fig dried berries fruitcake etc. – overlay a musky meaty (but not quite sulfurous) layer of malt. Caramel apple and hints of cocoa (stopping short of actual chocolate) complete the picture. This is somewhat limited in scope but not objectionable and the sherry is clear and present.Palate Slightly syrupy body. The same fruits start things out followed by a hotter-than-expected tongue burn for 46% ABV. Red vines caramel and old leather appear in sequence. A bit muddled and not as sweet or fruity as I’d like.Finish Dried figs again and drying red-wine tannins. Mildly bitter and vague. Fades out with aromatic cocktail bitters (gentian) and anise.With Water A few drops of water appears to make a mess of the dried fruits – making some fresh and hiding the rest. Cherry I think? The tongue burn does appear to be lessened and the water adds a note of cinnamon. OK I guess. Add the water only if you find the tongue burn annoying.Overall Not exactly a competitor for Macallan 18 or GlenDronach 18 but at $58 this delivers on its promise Sherry-flavored malt with some age on it. There’s nothing stand-out about it (aside from the price) but you’re not likely to be too disappointed if you go in with that expectation. For the record I think it’s a mediocre cask of Macallan despite the initial meatiness (which would suggest Mortlach).
282,Knob Creek Single Barrel Bourbon (9 year) - Of the big bourbon brands I’ve said before that Knob Creek with its good price point and nice balance of classic bourbon flavors with a little extra fruit and citrus and an actual age statement has made it a regular in my drinks cabinet. If I’m going to make an Old Fashioned or just sip some bourbon with or without ice without thinking too hard about what I’m doing I’m likely to reach for the Knob Creek. In particular I’m a fan of the Small Batch. This is slightly ironic considering that I loathe (Ok not “loathe” but I wouldn’t choose it) the standard Jim Beam which is owned by the same company and produced at the same distillery from the same low-rye mash bill (77% corn 13% rye 10% malted barley). For what it’s worth Booker’s and Baker’s are also made by Beam from this same mash bill.I like to try different bottlings from a range when possible to get different perspectives on a brand/recipe so when my brother-in-law brought around a bottle of the 120 proof (!) Knob single barrel I eagerly siphoned some to review. In my haste I neglected to jot down the barrel number. Keep in mind that as a single-barrel release these are likely to vary in quality and character significantly between barrels and your bottle might be worlds apart from the one I reviewed below.Nose Heavily oaky notes of resin wood stain and furniture polish. Dark highly caramelized sugars (burnt caramel) and a deep cherry syrup note like the liquid/sludge in a jar of real maraschino cherries. Orange peel rounds out the profile. After a rest in the glass the profile becomes sweeter and rounder with a vanilla buttercream frosting element.Palate Medium body almost syrupy. Intense unholy tongue burn… ouch… no really my tongue is on fire! After feeling returns to the extremities and the sweat recedes the flavors largely mirror the notes from the aroma cherry burnt caramel oak furniture polish. I don’t think I have the literary talent to describe this but if I were to lick an antique wooden desk so hard that the finish came off I believe it would taste something like this. Having never done so I can only speculate.Finish Medium-short. A nice orange oil note persists after swallowing. Very little bitterness or tannin despite all the oak. Some charcoal flavors remain as it fades.With Water Several drops of water release a vegetal/grassy note in the aroma without substantially decreasing the tongue burn. Ouch again. There may be a bit more nuttiness on the finish (hazelnuts?). Water is optional here.Overall First of all at 60% ABV this is the kind of thing that can strip paint. I can only imagine the number of taste bud cells that sacrificed themselves to the cause of reviewing this whiskey. Severely woody with deeply oaky notes and a heavy barrage of burned sugar notes this appeals to a very specific bourbon consumer. If you don’t care about fruity notes you aren’t interested in the interplay of spice notes with delicate oak-derived sugars and you really just want something you could fill a kerosene lamp with… this stuff will fit the bill. Otherwise it’s a little one-dimensional. For my money I’d rather have the Knob Creek Small Batch 9 year and save $10.
283,Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon (9 year) - After the dismal showing of that Kirkland (Costco) bottling of Beam bourbon which I had hoped was a value bottling of Knob Creek I found myself craving the real thing. The stuff may come from the same Beam distillery in Clermont Kentucky but it’s worlds different to my taste buds.Knob Creek a Beam brand was created by bourbon legend and Beam master distiller Booker Noe in 1992. It’s aged longer than most bourbons (9 years) and bottled at a respectable 100 proof. It’s part of Beam’s “Small Batch” collection. See the link above for my thoughts on the “Small Batch” term.Update 3/15/2021 I’ve re-reviewed this bourbon here.Nose Deeply caramelized sugar heavy oak molasses and a maraschino cherry on top. This definitely benefits from a rest in the glass – the notes meld better and mellow. Now I get a little rye eucalyptus and pine sap and some gentler malt and marshmallow notes.Palate Well rounded with a spike of cherry tartness. Not cloyingly sweet but barrel sugars and corn sweetness are evident. Still heavy on the wood but the effect is bracing rather than astringent.Finish Long. A little of the pine sap comes back along with corn-syrup candies (caramel corn) and a little drying wood tannin and some barbeque char. Little to no bitterness.With Water At 100 proof this is intended to be mixed with something (water ice or vermouth and bitters). A few drops of water are effective at rounding off the edges and smoothing out the whole operation. I don’t detect any additional aromas or flavors but the water doesn’t hurt and does tame the burn.Overall A pleasant forthright bourbon. It is oaked right up to the maximum of effectiveness (any more would be like chewing on bark) and delivers standard bourbon flavors with balance and without any off notes. Cheap enough (and the right ABV) for mixing widely available and robust enough to enjoy by the glass. You could certainly do worse than this for a house bourbon. Some of my best Manhattans and Old Fashioneds were made with Knob Creek.
284,Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon (9 year) Revisited - I’ve been an on-and-off friend of Knob Creek and a mostly fair weather friend to Beam products in general. I’ve always liked Knob Creek’s age-stated 9 year-old although judging by what I wrote seven years ago in that link the quality has dropped a bit (or I’ve gotten jaded which is possible). I really liked Old Tub from Beam which is still the deal of the century if you can find some. Still most Beam bourbons give me a distinct off-note that’s somewhere in between engine grease and bitter vegetation like chewing on grass.On this the anniversary of the Covid-19 lockdowns I decided to write about my constant companion throughout The Knob Creek Small Batch (9 year) 100-proof Bourbon. Is it good bourbon? Not particularly. But it is cheap it is reliable and it was the largest bottle of bourbon I could grab at my last Costco run before the lockdown descended. I look back on that time now and picture myself and my 1.75 liter bottle of Knob Creek like the weary be-ragged traveler picking through post-apocalyptic rubble for canned goods and ammunition followed by his trusty mutt sidekick. I would cradle my giant bottle of Knob Creek knowing it was the one thing that would relieve me of the tensions of a day of trying to work-at-home while my kid tried to do Kindergarten-at-home 20 feet away. The one solace after counting our rolls of toilet paper and doing ration calculations in my head. My constant companion through the end of the world as we knew it.I’ll repeat though. This isn’t great bourbon. It’s serviceable bourbon and it’s cheap and it came in a freaking giant bottle that lasted me for a great deal of the past year. It made many Old Fashioneds and I saluted its empty bottle like the grave of a comrade-in-arms. We went through a lot together me and my bottle of Knob Creek. Here’s to you friend.Nose Leather (or maybe leather conditioning products…) unsalted peanuts corn syrup and light brown sugar. The nose tickle is prominent but the aromas are tame. There is definitely a faint Beam-esque vegetal/grassy note which (along with the peanut / peanut shell aroma) grows as the whiskey rests in the glass.Palate Thin body. Slightly bitter barrel char and mildly sweet corn syrup hits the tongue first. After a moderate tongue burn there is cinnamon red-hot candies bitter charcoal and dry astringent oak.Finish Medium length. Even drier than the palate. The wood and charcoal remain but little else. Fades without evolving.With Water A few drops of water reveal a circus peanut aroma (which is actually banana-flavored candy). The palate also becomes a little livelier. Water is fully optional here.Overall A very middle-of-the-road bourbon which verges on dryness. It has the Beam family curse house character vegetal/grassy flavor but it’s mild and in the background. Still none of the other flavors come much to the fore. This is mixing bourbon or (if you’re in a pinch) whiskey-in-glass-and-consume bourbon. Don’t think about it too much. It makes very functional cocktails.I’m marking this “Not Recommended” because I’ve had better Beam products and in fact better bourbons in this (very low) price range. Don’t be put off though if you’re buying this for mixing. It excels at that!Also if you are picking through the rubble of a post-apocalyptic wasteland and find a Costco-sized bottle of this in the debris may it serve you as well as it did me.
285,Knob Creek Small Batch Rye - Well I liked Knob Creek Bourbon from Beam and had an opportunity recently thanks to Sarah at DBC (thanks Sarah!) to try Knob Creek Rye. At 100 proof but lacking an age statement it competes with a multitude of young-ish ryes on the market all formulated to cash in on the classic cocktail revival trend. Unlike most of those this is not relabelled LDI/MGP rye but is actually distilled by Beam in Clermont Kentucky. Its mashbill is secret but some sources list it at 51% rye (the legal minimum) which jives with what I tasted below.Nose Soft grains and high notes of clove anise (black licorice) and cinnamon extract (cinnamon candy). The aroma is not unlike the inside of an old-time candy shop. Despite all the sugar references the aroma is not altogether sweet but rather reminiscent of the extracts and spices that make those candies memorable. Unlike other young ryes there isn’t much menthol eucalyptus or mint. Deep in the glass there’s a stirring of caraway and camphor.Palate Spicy at first bursting with cinnamon then cooling off into straightforward cereal notes dusty spice cabinet and Good & Plenty’s (there’s that candy again).Finish Short. The spices return but tempered with dried apple caramel and a beery malt. The finish falls off quickly but is never bitter.With Water Water amplifies the spice at the expense of balance although the aroma is sweeter. Unless the water is frozen and accompanies vermouth and bitters I’d skip it.Overall For me Knob Creek Rye sits squarely in the middle of the available (read young) ryes currently available. It avoids the “spicy to a fault” armies of LDI/MGP rye clones with a nice balance of rye spiciness against warm sweet cereal notes. However it doesn’t show any of the bright minty notes of craft ryes nor the deep earthy sweetness of Rittenhouse 100. Since it’s easier to acquire in some places than Rittenhouse and it makes phenomenal rye-based cocktails I think this is a good choice for a house rye especially if you can’t find a reliable source of Rittenhouse 100.
286,Koval Single Barrel Millet Whiskey - People like to use the word “grains” when talking about the inputs to whiskey as if the word encompasses such a wide variety of cereal grains that listing them is just too hard. In reality “grain” whiskeys are made almost entirely of commodity corn. Other grains included under this umbrella are wheat barley (malted or unmalted) and rye. That’s about it. So we must leave it to the pioneers in the craft whisky scene to experiment with some of the other more-than-50 food crop cereal grains in the world.Koval distillery in Chicago is an undeniable pioneer in this space with various whiskies for sale distilled from millet oats spelt wheat and rye. All of Koval’s spirits are single-barrel releases and all are made from organic grains farmed in the American Midwest. Of note is that Koval prides itself on only using heart cuts in its distillation. I’m not sure that’s such a good thing… while the heads and tails in a distillation run definitely contain most of the off-flavors and undesirable distillation by-products they also contain some of the most interesting ones. The art of distillation is (partially) in cutting just the right amount of heads and tails into the heart. Also narrower cuts can sometimes needlessly increase the cost of distillation and thus inflate the final price.The Koval Millet whiskey is aged in 30-gallon new charred oak barrels (like bourbon distilleries Koval sells all of its barrels after a single use). I was unable to find any information about the amount of time this whiskey spends in-barrel so I would go ahead and assume it’s quite young. My tasting sample was from a Flaviar tasting box and was filled from a bottle in October of 2015.Nose Spicy. Eucalyptus and pine resin (like young rye) flecked with mace raspberry leaves black tea and lemon peel. Mild oak. Unusual although it would be easy to dismiss this as young rye at first smell.Palate Medium bodied. Sweet on the tongue with a lot of wood sugars and vegetal honey. More rye-like spice notes including clove cinnamon and pine resin.Finish Medium-long. Marshmallow and cinnamon rolls. Reprise of the palate notes which fade with a little mouth-drying mint/menthol.With Water A few drops of water increase the pine notes and thins the flavors on the finish. I wouldn’t use water with this.Overall Reminds me of Tom’s Foolery batch 1 with heavy pine notes that are only partially offset by unique grain sweetness and spices. Well-made but either this is what millet whiskey tastes like or it needs more time in barrel. With all of Koval’s craft chops and excellent transparency I’d really like to see them publish the ages of their whiskies as well as offer some more mature products. At least the price is spot-on for an experimental young craft whiskey.
287,Kyrö Verso Rye - The global expansion in whisky production due to the boom in demand has brought us some real gems such as Kavalan out of Taiwan Amrut Fusion from India and even the weirdness that is Santis from Switzerland. Part of the joy I get from writing about whisky is the opportunity to try new and different whiskies frequently. Sometimes though it doesn’t go as well.As part of a Flaviar sample pack (Ryevolution) I tasted a sample of Verso rye whisky from the Kyrö Distillery Company in Finland that was collected from bottle in April of 2015. This is a 100% malted rye whisky aged for only four months in very small new American white oak casks and bottled at 46.5% ABV. The distillery which makes several products all from rye grain began distilling in 2014 in a refurbished cheese factory.That makes it kind of a speed-aged rye white dog. A new gem on the world whisky scene? Note that this is bottled in 500ml (0.5L) bottles and does not appear to be available in the US. The best pricing info I can find puts it at around $56 for 500ml which makes it a whopping $75+ if sold in the US in standard 750ml bottles. Yikes.Nose Very gin-y. Strong unappealing genever notes of heavily malted rye juniper Pine-Sol cleaner and moonshine. It seems the heart cut on this was very wide and picked up a lot of soapy piney medicinal notes. Reminds me a lot of Anchor Spirits Genevieve a malty gin in the genever style.Palate Thin body. Bright and tart with gingersnap cookies lemon peel a malty sweetness and an unfortunate reprise of the gin notes from the aroma. Still the palate is much better balanced and much tastier than the aroma promised.Finish Medium-long. Candied ginger cinnamon taffy black pepper. Not bitter and thankfully not reminiscent of gin.With Water Water if anything accentuates the gin notes. Skip it.Overall Not my cup of tea. The aroma grabs me by the nose and screams “GIN” and not nice clean crisp London dry gin either but the soapy bathtub-style malty gin sold today as genever. Luckily the palate and especially the finish redeem it with a tasty balance of sweet spiced baked goods and a nice ginger note. A rollercoaster but not one I’d pay to ride again. Especially not at those prices.
288,Lagavulin (12 year) - Ah Lagavulin. I last reviewed a product from this Islay distillery in November of 2010. A year and a half later I still think it’s one of the best malts available for under $100. Oaky and smoky full and creamy with just a little touch of fruit. Imagine my surprise when I learn that Diageo releases a 12 year-old version of the same malt… for $85 to $99 a bottle. What?! An annual release bottled at 57.5% ABV after a January distillation “in the middle of the night” according to Diageo Senior Master of Whisky Steve Beal – who was I think making fun of us. The special bottling comes from 100% American oak casks as opposed to the 16 which is aged in a combination of American and European oak. When asked where the casks came from Mr. Beal told us “Probably Bulleit casks.” Cool.So why does Diageo set the price so high? My guess is “because they can”. It’s a cask-strength special-edition bottling with a limited run. According to Mr. Beal the extra effort and cost associated with doing small-run bottlings like this justifies the price. I doubt it justifies the extra $30 but there you are.Nose Full strength wood smoke. Campfire. Nice undercurrent of cereal. Hay. Lighter than expected without much brine. Refined. Some nice buttered toast!Palate Clean fire. Smoky as all get-out. Not much wood but a little smoked fish.Finish Sweet finally. Nice oatmeal covered by a thick layer of smoke. Finishes with sea salt. No bitterness.Water Reveals… banana? on the nose which dissipates quickly. Campfire notes are subdued. The water adds in banana taffy and a rummy kind of cane sugar in the nose. Perks up the palate.Overall The 12 has a clearer cleaner flavor than Lagavulin 16 more bright and more powerful – lean and stripped-down. It shows Islay peat pure and without excess wood or the sweetness inherent in the use of European oak. I think buying Lagavulin 12 is like spending top dollar for scratchy bootleg live recordings of a favorite artist. It’s an interesting case study in the variations present in the whisky due to changes in maturation (less age – thus less oak – and no sherry) but only Lagavulin devotees should consider paying the premium for the experience.
289,"Lagavulin (16 year) - Lagavulin produces a classic 16-year Islay single-malt which is well known for its mellow roundness and liberal use of peat. It can be difficult to find a bottle in retail that hasn’t been marked up dramatically. I once saw a bottle in a Lake Tahoe liquor store priced at $115!The aroma is unmistakably smokey with none of the molasses notes of some maltier Scotches. I smell a little pine or cedar and maybe a suggestion of sea air or brine. The aroma is clearer and more concentrated in the glass without water added so I suggest smelling this whisky before adding a few drops of water if that’s your thing.The mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious with a noticeably low level of fire on the tongue. The early flavors get straight to the oak and then to the peat with a hint of fruit or hazelnut. There are medium notes of peat and some smoke on the tongue which are more pronounced in the finish. The finish is long and straightforward mostly campfire and a suggestion of cherry or cherrywood. The sugar of the barley is not forward in this bottle but the balance between peat and malt and the smoothness with which it comes off make this a very satisfying dram.I could not identify a difference between the glass with a few drops of water added and the glass without except that the straight-up flavor was more cohesive and coated my mouth more fully. I personally do not think this Scotch benefits from the addition of water.This Lagavulin is a prime example of a smokey Islay malt with some years behind it. The peat is aggressive but the oak balances it nicely. The age of the malt gives it a roundness and mutes the fire.This Scotch might pair well with a cigar a small amount of fatty fish (salmon or mackerel) a well-aged steak or a creamy dessert. It is probably best enjoyed by itself however.
"
290,Lagavulin (8 year) - Lagavulin seems to be involved in some sort of reverse age-statement arms race (with who?). The classic 16 year Lagavulin was on everyone’s lips in oh 2010 and then a cask-strength 12 year-old dropped (for like a Benjamin) in 2017. Now an 8 year at a somewhat elevated 48% ABV. What’s next? A 3-year?Something about paying almost as much money for an 8 year-old when something from the distillery is available at TWICE the age and only 5% lower ABV… that chafes me in ways I can’t quite put into words. I know. Me? Stymied over how to complain about prices? To be fair prices for this bottle appear to be all over the place with my Total Wine charging $58 (Lagavulin 16 $68) K&L charging $50 (Lagavulin 16 $70) and some random wine shops on the Internet listing it at $34 (Lagavulin 16 $70) I don’t really know what to think.Anyhoo we have here an 8 year-old Lagavulin bottled at 48% ABV and so pale that it’s almost clear. This was originally released as the distillery’s 200th (bicentenary) anniversary limited edition but has since been added to the core range. With that the information available online dries up. To my palate this seems to be missing the sherry portion found in the 16-year. Like the 12-year I would guess this is entirely from ex-bourbon casks.Nose A pungent nose missile straight to the olfactory centers of the brain. BOOM piercing peat with unmistakable Lagavulin character. A blossom of salted caramel honeysuckle fresh hay and refined clarified condensed ocean-flecked peat. Be careful with the nose tickle – it is sharp much deeper than the rim of the glass.Palate Soft medium body. Sweet and gentle initially lulling you but the lull is suddenly shattered by a wave of tongue burn. This is over mercifully quickly (amazing for a young malt at 48%) scattering wet leaves mushroomy peat sea spray sparkling minerality and caramel across the tongue in equal proportion.Finish Long. Begins with a slight pale oakiness then adds a layer of sooty (but not very bitter) charcoal. The peat and other notes are distant now and the party seems to be over quickly. The finish continues but with mostly dry wood and dry coal.With Water Several drops of water actually amplify the nose tickle. There might be an additional orange-peel note on the nose but it is fleeting. On the tongue I find a little more vanilla sweetness although the texture is thinner. The finish does pick up a perfume high-note jasmine maybe. Try both without and then with water.Overall More’s the pity I don’t have a sample of Lagavulin 16 on hand to compare so I have to go by memory. I do appreciate the increased ABV which Lagavulin malt seems to ride to great heights. The youthful peat is bracing and focused (and not nearly as wild as some other examples of young peat). The overall effect is impressive. Still I find myself missing some of the 16 year’s polish and roundness. I don’t find its perfect caramel-peat balance here nor enough wood to fill out the palate. That’s nitpicking though. This is excellent… and I could see choosing it after getting bored of a bottle or two of the 16-year. The price at 10-15% lower than the 16 is annoying. Unless that is you can find it for $34 a bottle. It’s a steal for that price.I do applaud Diageo’s choice to retain the age statement here even if I wish the price reflected the lower production cost of aging something for 8 fewer years. Maybe that’s why it can be found for $34… in some regions. I don’t even know anymore.
291,Lagavulin (9 year) – Game of Thrones “House Lannister” - This will be a short review largely because I’m still mentally on Christmas break. You may have read my review of the Game of Thrones edition of Mortlach recently and I reach the same conclusion here If you can find a closeout deal from any retailer that still has it it’s worth grabbing some. In other words it wasn’t worth $75 but sure as hell is worth $25.This bottling is simply a 9 year-old expression of Lagavulin which sounds young until you remember that peated single malt is usually quite good at younger ages and between Octomore Talisker 8 year and well Lagavulin 8 year no longer seems weird. The “House Lannister” bottling comes from only first-fill ex-bourbon casks (no sherry) and clocks in at 46% ABV.Nose Raw fungal cidery peat. Astringent (make that cider vinegar) and only mildly smoky (think wet peat moss instead of peat fire). Aside from the peat it’s a little shy and requires a short rest in the glass. Now I get raspberries (might be a first that one!) sweet cream shortbread cookie toffee and molasses (or treacle if you’re British).Palate Silky body. Charcoal-flecked peat up front now with wisps of smoke. These overtake most of the subtler notes. The tongue burn is minimal.Finish Long (duh). The peat and smoke persist joined now by marzipan raspberry taffy and charcoal. There is no bitterness – amazing. Fades sedately but without any new notes.With Water Several drops of water bring out more sooty fungal notes on the aroma and increase the smoke. Palate seems thinner and a little more feinty (vodka-esque). It does add a curious minty/tobacco note on the finish but I would skip water here. It just doesn’t need it and I’m not a fan of those extra sooty notes.Overall A very nice little Lagavulin. Anyone harboring hopes that this might be a way to buy the 16 year at a crazy discount will be disappointed but in its own right this is a tasty peated dram with its own individuality. The astringent/tart notes are indicative of youth but provide a very nice contrast to the not-over-the-top peat and bring interesting tart fruit notes to what is usually a very somber party. I would happily drink this when in a mood for peat and not miss the more-mature oaky polish of the 16 year. Let me put it another way This is far better than any peated scotch (malt or blend) that you can buy for $25. I would have been happy to drink this at $40. If you can still find it on sale and you like peated malt get some for the bunker. I bought three.
292,Lagavulin Distiller’s Edition (1995) - Diageo being the massive industrial giant that it is bends to the will of the whisky-geek masses with only a single extra-matured release from each of its “Classic Malts” distilleries. While some smaller distilleries release single casks and experimental vattings in what seems like a flurry Diageo claims that the extra overhead and effort involved in special releases is simply too much to bother with and so they stick to the Distiller’s Editions to satisfy those customers interested in a little something different. The DE releases are by no means trivial – the Lagavulin one is usually a vatting of between 300 and 400 casks – but this is small peanuts to a company primarily concerned with the annual manufacturing and distribution of 130 million bottles of Johnnie Walker.After the usual 16 years in primarily American oak casks the Lagavulin malt destined for Distiller’s Edition spends some additional time (somewhere between 6 months and 2 years varying every year) in Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry butts each containing around 300 liters of spirit. The bottle I sampled at K&L was distilled in 1995.Nose Raisin up front with a mild background of peat. Dried fruits fruitwood smoke. Black currants. Green sap with a hint of banana?Palate Clearly sherried with lots of concentrated dark fruits but now the peat I was missing in the nose comes through with nice balance. Smooth!Finish Overly sweet with the usual cast of sherry characters. The peat gets somewhat lost.With Water A drop of water reveals a sulfury reek of banana peel which dissipates but not before I resolve to avoid the water with this one.Overall Okay. Yeah it’s aged in PX sherry which is a big deal but… this particular expression falls short with me. The palate has a nice balance of fruit and smoke but the sherry overwhelms the traditional Lagavulin character (which I would have said was hard to do) on the nose and finish. Also despite the extra time in barrel there’s not a lot of wood character. I’d stick to the 16 and get my sherry kick elsewhere. I’ll probably get some flack for this one since lots of people love it. I’m a big fan of Lagavulin but this DE just didn’t resonate with me.
293,Laphroaig (10 year) - Laphroaig is about as classic Islay as you can get. Very heavily peated light bodied a powerhouse of maritime flavors and smoke smoke and more smoke. Sometimes after a glass of Laphroaig my mouth tastes like I’ve just finished smoking a pair of cigars. It really sticks with you but in a good way.Pale straw in color slightly oily in the texture and with almost no thickness of body this malt really lets you focus on the peat. Earthy smoky a tinge of sea flavors (seaweed brine iodine from the seaweed that grows profusely along the island’s coastline) and did I mention smoky?I personally only buy the 10 year-old expression because I feel that aging any further dampens the purity of the peat flavors. Also at approximately $35 it’s probably the best deal in Single-Malt Scotch anywhere. I keep a bottle on hand at all times.With Laphroaig’s Friends of Laphroaig program the purchase of a bottle grants you the “lease” on one square foot of the distillery’s own peat bog. Yes you can even show up at the distillery in person and they’ll give you a map to your “plot” and a dram of their whisky “against the chill sea breeze.” You can also register each bottle you buy and redeem points for merchandise in their online store.Here are my tasting notes from my most recent glass of the 10 year-old LaphroaigNose A pile of burning hay and grass. Campfire. Scorched wood. Seaweed or sea air. Hickory smoked meat. Black pepper.Palate Thin body ethereal. The peat is foremost with notes of ash freshly-dug earth hardwood coals and smoked fish. As it develops sweeter flavors emerge. Rosewater saltwater taffy buttery croissants malty beer oatmeal.Finish Lingering with hearty smoke and yet more peat. Also some oiliness on the tongue. The smoke will last all evening – I’ve even woken in the morning with my mouth tasting like a cigar.A dash of water rounds the flavors out – you get more cereal sweetness up front and the aromatic qualities are more noticable. This dram is somewhat improved by the addition of a minute amount of water.
294,Laphroaig (10 year) Cask Strength - This is the full cask strength version of Laphroaig’s flagship 10-year. At 57.8% ABV and not chill-filtered this is essentially the standard 10-year minus water and without the chill-filtration. That means there’s nothing between you and the raw fury of Laphroaig peat. Beware!Note This is a sample I saved from a friend’s bottle so I don’t know which batch it was. Sorry!Nose Unmistakable Laphroaig peat. Seaweed and salt seaspray with dense meaty woodsmoke like a driftwood bonfire on the beach. At 57.8% ABV it will crawl right up your nose if you get too close. Meat notes dance around the edge – like the charbroiled crust of a well-salted steak. Powerful and lean.Palate At full proof this stuff will take a layer of skin off of your tongue and pour saltwater in the wound. Once your tongue gets good and numb from the punishment you can taste finally the malty sweetness hidden beneath that fiery inferno of peat smoke.Finish Super long. Meaty again with crusty barbecued meat (minus the bbq sauce) smoldering campfire embers and crispy dried seaweed (nori). Fades (amazingly) without bitterness. A welcome respite from the torrent of flame.With Water A healthy splash of water is almost required as the malt is barely drinkable neat. Try to aim for a robust 50% ABV. At this point the nose is more correctly balanced between woodsmoke salt and sweet cereals. Vanilla saltwater taffy emerges and the finish acquires something minty. At even further dilution look for some very faint fruit notes – strawberry or raspberry and a more mossy subdued peat.Overall I only have a sample here but if I had a full bottle I might view it as an Everest in my cabinet. I would rarely be in the mood to hike its treacherous peaks but once in awhile the manly urge to conquer might rise in my chest and I might crack open the bottle to brave the frostbite and possible loss of life or limb that waits inside. Seriously though this is a challenging whisky that should only be attempted once a healthy respect for both heavily peated Islay (try Laphroaig 10 first) AND cask strength single malt (try Aberlour A’Bunadh first as well). Even when you’re ready for it don’t be a hero. Put in some water.
295,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr - After my recent review of Caol Ila Moch I thought I would keep the ball rolling by tasting another heavily-peated NAS Islay malt with an inscrutable Gaelic name! No? Too soon? Well I already wrote it so too bad.Laphroaig has taken their flagship first-fill ex-bourbon heavily-peated malt and changed up the recipe – swapping it into virgin European oak for the final two years. In other words it’s Laphroaig 10 but with a dip in virgin oak and a hearty 48% ABV. It’s also not chill-filtered. This is a travel retail release so with all the international travel going on right now in the midst of a global pandemic I’m sure many of you are in a position to snag a bottle. /sarcasmAn Cuan Mòr means “Big Ocean” in Gaelic which I guess is relevant to an island distillery but more important is the fact that virgin European oak is very uncommon in whisky finishing. Compass Box made waves by using barrel staves (and later after a scuffle with the SWA barrel heads) of virgin French oak to make the original Spice Tree. Most of the other virgin oak seen on the market is virgin American white oak which is cheaper. Usually the term “European oak” despite its vagueness means Spanish oak which is the traditional barrel wood for sherry. In case it wasn’t clear the word ‘virgin’ here describes a barrel that has not previously held liquid. All bourbon for instance is aged in virgin American oak.Since it has been almost 10 years (oh God I’m getting old) since I last reviewed the Laphroaig 10 year I decided to do my tasting of this sample side-by-side with a glass of the classic. I highly recommend doing this when the opportunity presents Try two similar whiskies side-by-side in identical glasses so it’s easier to pick out the differences.Nose Unmistakable Laphroaig aromas that fill the room when you open the bottle. Seaweed-heavy brine mild smoke smoking meat and vanilla. There’s a lot more oakiness and more oaky sweetness than the standard Laphroaig 10 although the peat elements seem identical.Palate Thin body. Moderate tongue burn (appropriate for something at nearly 50% ABV) is accompanied by mild oak vanilla-flecked smoke and the full gamut of iodine-and-seaweed Laphroaig peat.Finish Very long. You can usually taste Laphroaig the following day so that’s not news. The extra European oak notes do translate to the finish which has some cinnamon and vanilla to accompany the ever-present maritime peat.With Water A few drops of water ‘warm’ up the aroma a bit bringing the cinnamon notes to the front along with a dose of caramel. Try this without water first and then add a little to see how it changes for you.Overall I’m impressed that in a side-by-side comparison it’s clear that this is Laphroaig “plus”. You get extra cinnamon extra vanilla and extra oaky sweetness from the European oak that’s just simply missing from the standard expression. It does not taste more mature nor mellower. If you feel like your standard Laphroaig could use a little more flavor that isn’t peat you’ll probably enjoy this. It reminds me of the Laphroaig Quarter Cask although the wood notes are definitely different as they are derived from a different kind of oak.This is a tasty dram and lovers of Laphroaig will not be disappointed. However I’m scoring it a “Try before Buy” because it’s difficult to lay hands on a bottle and because it’s still 10 year-old whisky for north of $100 (most places seem to average $120). Ouch. No it’s not worth that. Maybe you can find a dram at a well-stocked bar or a bottle on sale at an airport Duty-Free bankruptcy sale? I dunno. I got my sample at Flaviar but availability of specific samples is very hit-or-miss there.
296,Laphroaig Cairdeas 2016 - Every year Laphroaig releases a “Cairdeas” limited edition intended to reward their “Friends of Laphroaig” aka repeat customers. “Cairdeas” is Scots Gaelic for “Friendship” after all. Each year’s expression is a different take on Laphroaig and the 2016 edition (which is still available on some store shelves or online if you hurry) is finished in hogsheads that were previously used to age Madeira wine. Madeira is a sweet fortified wine from the Madeira islands a Portuguese archipelago off the coast of North Africa. The sweet wine itself is similar to sherry and port.It’s not terribly unusual to age whisky in Madeira casks (Glenmorangie’s Private Edition bottling Bacalta uses them) although it’s not all that common to see peated scotch finished in fortified wine casks. Cairdeas 2016 is bottled at a potent 51.6% ABV and retails for around $80 while it’s still available. The whisky is NAS but it uses “fully-matured Laphroaig” before finishing which in previous years was code for 8 years old plus maybe a year or two in the wine barrels. As is usual with NAS you just don’t get to know the exact age. If that bothers you (I’m looking at you Jeff) then just vote with your wallet.Nose Unmistakably Laphroaig with an aroma evincing seaspray-battered coastlines boggy with brine and seaweed and sea grasses. As with other Laphroaigs the peat smoke is heavy on peat and light on smoke giving a sense of smoldering peat rather than outright fire. Underlying the peat is a thin layer of sweetness like a bushel of plums tossed into the kiln along with the rest. Palate Medium bodied. Sooty peat dominates while an incredibly gentle tongue burn for 51.6% ABV bakes your tongue. Fresh apple cider maraschino cherries and dates balance the herbal medicinal peatiness.Finish Long. Here the peat becomes ashy and betrays some bitter elements. The fruit is subdued but present clashing slightly with the bitterness but conveying a sense of cocktail bitters (sweet bitter medicinal herbal). The cognitive dissonance is familiar to me from other sherry-aged peat monsters and is something that I’m sure I could learn to love with enough practice…With Water A few drops of water dull most of the aroma revealing instead a sticky dried prune note. The tongue burn is further diminished but the whole becomes somewhat muddier and indistinct. Only add water if you feel the whisky is too hot when taken neat.Overall An unusual decadent take on the standard Laphroaig brashness. While most of me enjoys the layering of fruit and peat a small part misses the straightforward intensity austerity and rough edges of the Laphroaig 10 which seems to say “I don’t need any of that fruity nonsense” and which comes with an age statement to boot. Despite my quirks I can say that this is an accomplished well-balanced and rewarding dram at a perfectly reasonable $80 although Ardbeg Corryvreckan (a peated whisky with a distinctly different style) beats the pants off of this for the same (or similar) price.
297,Laphroaig Quarter-Cask - Laphroaig is unabashedly Islay. Its intense peatiness maritime character and (to some) off-putting medicinal bite are hallmarks that are present in every bottle. It was my “first love” in single malt really in whisky period. That first dram of the 10-year was eye-opening. Smokey woody sweet powerful. I woke up the next day tasting it on my lips and smelling it on my breath. To me any peated malt must necessarily be compared to Laphroaig.Today I’m trying the Quarter Cask expression a younger peated malt (5 years of ex-bourbon maturation plus an additional 7 months approximately in tiny “quarter casks” custom-made for this expression). The “finishing” in quarter casks gives the whisky far more exposure to wood than normally happens in larger standard casks. In addition this expression is bottled at a higher 48% ABV and without chill-filtering (yay!).Nose Classic Laphroaig. Up-front is smoldering seaweed with briny notes of coastal thunderstorms and tidepools. A woody sweetness like boiling maple syrup pervades the nose and elevates the peat smoke. Hints of barbecued short-ribs glazed ham and applewood-smoked fish. The 48% ABV can be felt in the nose-prickle. Deeper exploration reveals white chocolate chips freshly-baked sugar cookies and even deeper in some extinguished campfire (wood char). A few drops of water bring out some faint dark chocolate and toffee.Palate Medium bodied – not watery but also not chewy or oily. Right away there is big peat in that briny smoked-fish style. Smokehouse fumes sugarcane vanilla extract and a pervading young woodiness – freshly-hewn green wood dripping sap. A few drops of water brings an elevated sweetness to the mix with more maple syrup vanilla and raw cane sugar.Finish Long. Initially there is lingering peat salt water which yields to vanilla and a very drying oak tannin which fades into bitter spent wood and green sap. The peat doesn’t stay around as long as it does with the 10-year old.Water brings out the sweet notes and marries them perfectly with the peat. I recommend a few sparse drops. This dram is much more complex than the standard 10-year Laphroaig and interestingly less intensely peaty despite its younger age. There are several layers of oak flavors ranging from the early sweet vanilla through the earthy woody midsection to the bitter sappy finish which interplay very well with the usual Islay peat – complementing it and taming it slightly. I generally dislike drams that attempt to blend big fruity sweetness with peat or bone-dry asceticism with peat and this falls nicely in the middle. It gives you something to ponder whereas the 10-year just gives you something to drink. It is however pricier and that extra $14 isn’t always going to be worth it especially if Laphroaig 10 is already part of your daily dram rotation.
298,Laphroaig Select - Laphroaig is not new to NAS releases although this is the first addition to the core range of Laphroaig in awhile. The official back story for the Select (why does every new release need a back story these days?) is that the last distillery manager when Laphroaig was family-owned Ian Hunter was among the first to utilize ex-bourbon barrels in the maturation of single malt. At the time Laphroaig would have been primarily aged in used (and reused) European oak wine and fortified wine (sherry madeira port etc.) casks. Somehow that translates to a new Laphroaig release containing a mixture of Laphroaig matured variously in – get this – oloroso sherry PX-seasoned hogsheads new American white oak barrels quarter-casks and first-fill ex-bourbon barrels. Apparently several recipes were made in different percentages of each wood type and Laphroaig fans voted on their favorites. I missed that part but the chosen recipe is this one.Select has no added color but is probably chill-filtered (I say this because they emphasize the no-added-color thing but don’t mention the filtration) and is bottled at the bare minimum 40% ABV with no age statement. I definitely wish they’d used a little less water as 43% or 46% would have enabled this to stand up a little taller in comparison to the older and more-robust Laphroaigs in the lineup.Thanks to Dave E. for kindly sending me a sample from his bottle. Thanks Dave!Nose Definitely Laphroaig – a sweet spicy balance of ocean brine and beach bonfire smoke. Youthful with a slight vegetal (grassy) quality verging on mezcal. The malt content seems sparse without much foundation. Very little fruit perhaps jarred strawberry jam.Palate Medium body. Slight lemon peel heavy briny peat. Good malt-peat balance with just enough grain-based sweetness. There is a streak of dried jammy fruit running through it but so mild I might have missed it. Indeed during my first pass I didn’t think it was sherried at all.Finish Long. Slightly bitter and the youth shows through with green grass and that odd tequila-like vegetal note. Lemon again and mild red fruits. Fades with iodine and Band Aids (cresol).With Water Water seems to dull the aroma muting the peat. It brings out even more lemon on the palate and some additional sweetness. Skip the water especially at this proof.Overall This runs in the same vein as a lot of recent NAS releases. They are marketed as having something special – partial sherry maturation (in this case) or partial finishing or some unique barrel treatment etc. – in order to get you to forget that the NAS label means they’ve dumped some younger barrels into the vatting and on average is certainly going to be younger than the 10 year-old flagship (I have no information on the age of this and my raw guess based on indie bottlings of younger-than-10-year peated malt would be something like 6-7 years on average). Unlike a lot of those NAS releases however this one can be found for less money than the 10-year (IN SOME PLACES see note below). This means it can be thought of as a compromise on the shelf less money for less aging. It has the correct balance of lightly malty sweetness with briny seaweedy peat but lacks a little dimension compared to the 10 year-old and has a few minor youthful vestiges that come across as grass and tequila but luckily not acetone like some young malts. Eminently drinkable but the promised sherry is very very far in the background. If you like Laphroaig or are curious about peated single malt scotch and are willing to give up the “10” on the bottle in exchange for a refund at the register you probably won’t be disappointed. Just don’t go here looking for an upgrade and don’t spend more than $40 on a bottle.NOTE In some markets Laphroaig 10 is still under $40 a bottle. In those markets Laphroaig Select does not offer much of a discount and you should go for the 10 instead.
299,Laphroaig Triple Wood - So what do you do when you want to beat a competitor’s vast success with Double Wood? Simple. Triple Wood! (Although Auchentoshan beat them to it). In this case a reasonable vatting of standard ex-bourbon Laphroaig Laphroaig Quarter-Cask (does that really count as a separate ‘wood’?) and ex-oloroso sherry casks. The whole is bottled at a robust 48% ABV and not chill-filtered.Nose Slightly muted (but recognizable) Laphroaig peat with an immediate wave of fresh red fruits. This marriage creates a distinct ‘saltwater taffy’ vibe of the red variety. Is ‘red saltwater taffy’ a tasting note? It is now. Deeper in there’s some plum jam piney campfire smoke and the usual Laphroaig ‘iodine’ (which I usually read as seaweed) although less than usual.Palate The red fruits come to the fore and are sweeter than I expected – Jolly Rancher style. Red ones. Also cinnamon red-hots campfire smoke seaspray and wet charcoal.Finish Long-ish. The red fruit thing gets a little weird here. Jammy but smoked. Without the sweet background of malt it just leaves a taste like burned jam behind. At the tail end a little bitter oak charcoal and some mint.With Water Water sparks up the fruitiness and adds a little tartness. It does little on the palate besides tame the burn although it allows some sweet notes to echo into the finish thus reducing that dissonant burned jam note I mentioned. Water does help here.Overall This is not as well integrated as I’d like. When I drink Laphroaig I want the bitter coastal salt-flecked winds of Islay to batter me. I want smoke and fire and salt. I don’t really want smoky jam… but that’s me. I usually have this reaction with sherry-aged peated malt (except Lagavulin Distiller’s Edition where it works really well and Kilchoman Machir Bay where it only plays a supporting role). I mean – do you personally like strawberry jam with your smoked salmon or grape preserves with your maki sushi? Through personal bias alone I wouldn’t buy a bottle of this saving my money instead for the essential Laphroaig 10 year – or two! That said die-hard Laphroaig fans will need to buy a bottle to feed the obsession and anyone who likes smokey jam – this is your moment.
300,Larceny Bourbon - Larceny – an inventive name which refers to legendary whiskyman John E. Fitzgerald’s penchant for liberating bourbon directly from barrels as they matured in-warehouse (whiskey he did not own) – is a new mass-market Kentucky straight bourbon release from Heaven Hill. The bourbon is wheated – like Maker’s Mark and cult favorite Pappy Van Winkle – but this one comes from the makers of Elijah Craig Evan Williams and Parker’s Heritage. The wheat in question is used as the mashbill’s flavoring grain instead of the more traditional rye. This choice usually results in a softer fuller and less spicy bourbon than its rye-flavored siblings.The label says “small batch” which here means fewer than 100 barrels between the ages of 6 and 12 years. I really like a branded release that consists of whiskey made by the company that markets it – you know where this whiskey comes from – it’s Heaven Hill not some combination of mystery casks from mystery producers which might change next batch because the blender couldn’t source the same bourbon the second time around.Nose Wood chips cherry cough syrup corn syrup (these all start out the same don’t they?) Deeper in there’s some cake frosting and wood sap. There’s also something slightly astringent but not quite paint thinner. Quite woody and a significant nose tickle.Palate Strong burn for 46% ABV. Viscous. Initially marshmallow and balsa wood. Grassy and woody with oak tannins obvious in the degree of mouth-drying pucker. Hazelnut butter and caramel round out a decent lineup of flavors.Finish Tobacco burnt caramel and more tannin. Medium length. Fades from slightly bitter to soft and sweet – Tootsie Rolls? Then ends with apricot pits.With Water Water picks up the astringent in the nose until it’s almost winey. Also reveals more vanilla. Softens the tongue burn considerably but adds a somewhat unpleasant charcoal/ash note. Overall The nose is lackluster and overly biting (it would probably benefit from a longer rest in the glass) but some interesting flavors redeem the palate and the finish is pleasantly non-bitter. Not too shabby for $25 bourbon out of a plastic miniature bottle. I like the effect of wheat on a bourbon (I think of it as tasting of vanilla instead of cinnamon) and while this is no Pappy Van Winkle I like it far more than I like Maker’s Mark. For $25 or less you can hardly go wrong with a great mixing bourbon and a reasonable sipping bourbon in the same bottle especially if you’ve been underwhelmed by Maker’s Mark in the past.
301,Ledaig (10 year) - Once cannot review Tobermory without also tasting its other bottling of peated malt Ledaig. Much like Springbank releases a heavily-peated malt by the name of Longrow Tobermory makes both an unpeated malt under its own name and this heavily-peated malt. Both also acquire peat character from the water that flows to the distillery over bogs. Unlike many distilleries in the Scottish islands Tobermory matures its malts in a warehouse on the mainland not on the island.Nose Unmistakably peated. Oily with tobacco iodine vinegar and smoke. The earthy peat of Tobermory is here totally eclipsed by in-your-face smokiness. Very similar to Islay malts particularly the brash younger ones. The peat here is somewhat muddy and unfocused.Palate Medium body with some creaminess. The peat takes a step back allowing its origin as Tobermory to show. Those industrial oily notes emerge along with some caramel and vanilla and a good dose of ashy barrel char.Finish Complex and long. Cigar ash smoking meats salty brine and seaweed. Now the peat is in better harmony with the malt.With Water Water seems unnecessary – it makes the peat smell more like cigarette ash to me although it may sweeten the palate.Overall A nose overly dominant with peat is improved by better balance on the tongue and in the finish. While still less focused and more “dirty” (in the sense of the assorted unpleasant side-effects of peat) than similarly-priced Islays there is reasonable complexity. For someone who loves peat but has grown tired of the standards Ledaig offers a different take. It is especially enlightening when tasted alongside its brother-in-arms Tobermory. Like Tobermory Ledaig benefits from long-aging and the older (20+ years) malts are considered to be refined and complex. For that reason and for the unfocused muddy quality of the peat I don’t recommend Ledaig 10-year although it is priced more competitively than its sibling Tobermory.
302,Legent Bourbon - You may remember a few years ago when the purchase of bourbon giant Beam Global by Japanese drinks conglomerate Suntory shook the whiskey world. Everyone wanted to know whether the Japanese – who are no slouches when it comes to whisky themselves – would interfere with the making of the classic American bourbons in Beam’s portfolio. Unless I missed something the answer has been a big resounding “no” and Beam whiskey hasn’t changed a bit. In fact the only outward sign of the merger is this new expression. Legent is a love-child of classic American bourbon and Japanese blending artistry which is intended to show how these two disparate whiskeymaking styles can harmonize. Fred Noe Jim Beam’s master distiller and Shinji Fukuyo Suntory’s chief whisky blender chose 5 year-old barrels of Kentucky bourbon (from the standard Beam “low rye” mashbill of 76% corn 12% rye 10% malted barley) and finished some of them in California red wine casks and some in sherry casks. The original bourbon (the largest component by volume) and the two finishes were then blended together by Suntory’s Fukuyo in the Japanese style.The final whiskey is bottled at a robust 47% ABV. You can find this Japanese-influenced Beam bourbon for a fairly reasonable (these days) $35 – $40.I got a chance to taste this bourbon when a college buddy of mine Drew brought a bottle to a recent reunion-of-sorts. I admit that this review may have been written on the back of a brown paper bag (the vacation rental had no paper and I had no tablet) and perhaps after an evening of tasting a little too much of the aforementioned bottle. Still these are the memories that stick with you Good friends good food and good booze. I’ll take that any day over a box of dusty samples.Nose Beam green apple and green grass. Slight tart lemon note and some kind of exotic fruit like ground cherry or… tomatillo? Nice balance. Butterscotch tones. Some oak.Palate Thin body with an immediate and robust tongue burn. Almost (but not quite) too hot. Nice oaky sugars nutty nougat and more Beam-style cut grass.Finish On the longer side. Fruit finally appears with elements of classic sherry (plum raisin vague rancio). Continues nutty and now with some rye spices (mostly clove) and not-at-all bitter oak.With Water Water adds a lot of acetone to the aroma but also adds sweetness (vanilla buttercream frosting) to the palate. There’s a little more oaky presence and caramel on the finish. Water optional – I would only add it if you need to proof it down due to the acetone note it brings out on the nose.Overall Very good for the price. The sherry finish is detectable but not at all dominant. Really due to its balance and assertive flavors this may be one of the best Beam whiskies that I’ve had. Well done Suntory.
303,"Loch Lomond Single Malt - Loch Lomond unfortunately not available in the United States offers an NAS entry-level malt for bottom dollar. In my unending quest to taste all of the budget drams no matter where they are sold I sought a sample from Master of Malt’s Drinks by the Dram program. Loch Lomond is a small distillery that quietly churns out product and that product goes by many names including Loch Lomond Inchmurrin and Old Rhosdhu (among others). While classified as a Highland (or West Highland) distillery based on its location in Alexdandria near Dumbarton it is literally just up the road from Glasgow. Its style is also in line with Lowland malts simple subtle light and crisp. This 40% ABV no-age-statement bottling was aged in ex-bourbon casks.Note Loch Lomond has recently revamped their line and renamed their core bottlings. This review sample was from the older bottle with the blue label (pictured). The replacement is called “Loch Lomond Original”.Nose Very light and floral aroma with some stronger notes of honey lavender green banana lemon peel and fresh unmalted barley.Palate Medium bodied. Honeyed with a tinge of tongue burn despite the low ABV. Flavor profile is mostly grain-based with homemade yeasty bread mashed bananas malted cereal and oatmeal with honey.Finish Very short. A reprise of the cereal notes plus a bit of that lavender and honey crushed peanuts and musty hay. Pleasant enough and not bitter. Fades with some barky oak although it leaves behind a patina on the tongue of wet cardboard.With Water A few drops of water release a note of aloe on the nose but dampens the florals. It has no discernible effect on the rest of the experience. I’d skip the water.Overall A mild unassuming dram. It reminds me of a slightly less successful ex-bourbon cask Balvenie. The nose is floral and clean while the palate could use a few high notes and less bland malt. The finish is a bit weird but all of this is nitpicking for an NAS malt priced under $30. In a constrained budget situation I would put it up against Speyburn 10 and and be equally happy with either.Regarding its age I’d hazard a guess that it’s around 8 or 9 years on average.
"
304,Longmorn (16 year) - Longmorn has long been a sought-after component for blending. Robust and flavorful even without heavy cask treatment it adds depth and sweetness to a blend. After several changes of hands Longmorn is now owned by drinks giant Pernod Ricard although they don’t bother to recognize the fact on their English website. What gives Pernod?Having already tried Longmorn in the form of an independently bottled single-cask exclusive to K&L I’m coming at this one from the wrong direction. Longmorn’s 16 year-old official bottling is aged in ex-bourbon not sherry and is bottled at a surprising 48% ABV.Nose Lemon and honey over a bed of warm cereal grains and lightly toasted nuts. A faint oiliness suggests complexity.Palate Rich and syrupy in body. A poignant tongue burn at 48% which subsides into nutty malt nougat and a faint tartness perhaps orange peel. Chocolate-chip cookie dough! Yes.Finish Medium. Warming with remnants of freshly-baked sugar cookies fresh cashew butter and white chocolate. No bitterness to speak of.With Water Water seems to only tame the burn (and useful at that). It cuts a little of the cohesiveness making the malt somewhat disjointed. I’d skip the water unless the burn is too much.Overall I’m coming at this a little backwards having first tasted a heavily sherried single-cask expression of Longmorn before tasting the official distillery bottling which is not sherried at all. I do miss the heavy fruit notes but Longmorn still delivers flavor and not just the typical ex-bourbon vanilla notes. It has enough body to stand on its own and plenty of malty sweetness. The raw cookie dough component is especially exciting.I’d recommend this to lovers of whisky who think bourbon is too strong peat is too smokey and sherry is too sweet. This is the kind of middle road whisky where you find the caramel cookie nutty notes that you want without sacrificing body or intensity. HOWEVER… we’re looking at an unreasonable $95 price tag which I simply would not pay for a flagship official bottling at 16 years. What are they thinking? Sell this at $60 and you’ve got me hooked. If you do some web searching you might find it for $78 but that’s still too high in my opinion.Good whisky abhorrent price. For the price ALONE I’m marking this “Not Recommended” – give us a break Pernod Ricard.
305,Longrow Peated - People who have been around this market for awhile will probably remember Longrow C.V. and can rest assured that Longrow Peated is that same cult favorite in a new dress. To save myself some typing you can read about Springbank and its convoluted distillation process below in “About the Distillery”. Unlike the Springbank-labelled bottles Longrow is fully peated and aged in ex-bourbon without any sherry cask influence. It’s also not chill-filtered has no added coloring (indeed it’s quite pale) and has no age statement. I’d place it somewhere around 9 years but it’s hard to tell since it’s possible for a blend of ages to be used in NAS bottles.Nose Straightforward smoke with slightly briny peat. Sweet undertones of vanilla cream soda and fresh hay plus a strong lemon peel note. After a rest in the glass the peat takes a back seat to the lemon.Palate Syrupy body. Mild tongue burn which quickly reveals earthy peat slowly smoldering campfire smoke sandalwood white peppercorn and lemon custard.Finish Long. The best parts of the peat continue through the finish accompanied by the same lemon note. Lingering flavors of fresh earth and smoke are joined by menthol. There is only very little charcoal bitterness. The finish fades gracefully and slowly but without further evolution.With Water A few drops of water initially mute the nose entirely (including all the peat) necessitating a rest in the glass. First a very shy floral note emerges then business as usual. It also seems to thin the body. Skip the water.Overall An elegant refined peat shares equal billing with decadent lemon oil. While there is no mistaking this as anything but a fully peated malt the peat is not as in-your-face as other peated standards. On one hand this means less street cred for braving the tongue-thrashing available in more popular whiskies. On the other hand this means the peat is better integrated and serves as a contrast rather than a focus. I’m not typically a fan of lemon-dominated whiskies however as the aromas sometimes verge towards cleaning-product.I should note that this does not have many of the things I find fascinating about Springbank distillates. It is heavy sure but it lacks the oils and grunge that typify the spirit for me. Still I can’t deny that it’s a well-balanced well-crafted and tasty peated malt. If you don’t mind the lemon you’ll probably enjoy this thoroughly.A note on price Springbank’s brands (Springbank Longrow Hazelburn) are typically far less expensive in the UK and related markets. I generally find them to be very much worth their UK prices and not quite worth their US prices. Try to get them via travel or when already placing an overseas order.Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly. The distillery uses traditional worm tubs a cast-iron mash tun and employs mechanical ‘rummagers’ (to prevent a buildup of burnt deposits) in the copper stills which are heated with a combination of steam and direct oil fire. Springbank uses three stills to create a 2.8-time (not triple) distillation. Now hold on because this math is tricky The first “wash” distillation produces so-called “low wines” which are around 20% alcohol. A second distillation produces an intermediate distillate which is in the neighborhood of 35% alcohol. A third still is charged with a solution of 80% of this double-distillate and 20% of the “low wines” and a third distillation is performed. Thus in the final spirit around 80% of the volume has been triple-distilled while around 20% of the volume has been double-distilled. Hence 2.8x distillation. Phew! For a fantastic and in-depth guided tour of Springbank distillery be sure to check out Ralfy’s visit (scroll down).Springbank also makes Longrow (a peated malt) and (new in 2006) Hazelburn (unpeated truly triple-distilled). These along with the distillery’s flagship Springbank bottlings are all non-chill-filtered have no caramel coloring and are reduced to bottling strength on-site with the same water used to produce the whisky. The water like all Campbeltown whiskies comes from the Crosshill Loch in the hills above the town and is supplemented by a private well from a borehole drilled deep into the rock beneath the town. Note that the Springbank “CV” bottling which is at a similar price-point is purportedly a vatting of 6 8 and 12 year-old malts (unverified) from different barrel finishes.
306,Lost Distillery – Lossit - This one falls in the category of “why didn’t I think of that?” The Lost Distillery Company founded in 2012 uses archival records and the history of regional distillation of whisky in Scotland to create a “map” of the likely flavors and aromas present in long-closed distilleries and then creates and bottles replicas of those whiskies using blends of modern malts. One could argue that without actual preserved samples to taste and compare with these replicas really could taste like anything and nobody would be the wiser. “One” would also be a buzzkill at parties I imagine. At an entirely reasonable $43 a bottle you can’t really complain too loudly about the possible inaccuracies in the Lost Distillery Company’s replica process. Read more about it here. If nothing else it’s a fun story and a tasty whisky. Compared to a lot of the other types of “Trust us we’re historical!” marketing being done in the whisky sector this one is pretty harmless.The Lossit distillery was the largest producer of (then illicit) whisky on Islay. The distillery was founded in 1817 in the town of Ballygrant and closed in 1867 when blended scotch ate the lunch of many of Scotland’s small malt-only distilleries forcing closures across the country. For a seriously in-depth history of Lossit click here. To re-create this lost malt whisky The Lost Distillery Company blended 5 to 10 single malts around a centerpiece of peated Ben Nevis including a few malts finished in oloroso and PX sherry casks. Without chill filtration or added coloring Lossit is bottled at a drinkable 43% ABV in an attractive matte black bottle.Nose Lightly teasingly peated. White peach green tea and vanilla. Delicately sweet with a very slight hay character.Palate Thin body. An initial bite of charcoal-flecked smoky peat (like Ardbeg). Mild tongue burn. Slightly meaty black pepper and only the barest sweetness. Much peatier than the aroma let on. Campfire.Finish Long. Peppery with slightly bitter charcoal. Fades leaving walnuts and cut hay. Bracing drying and spicy.With Water A few drops of water draw more peat out of the liquid which seems mossy. It also noticeably sweetens the palate adds a little body and makes the finish more vibrant and tart. Water does not go amiss with this one.Overall This actually reminds me of a cross between young Ardbeg and Talisker. It is peppery and robust like Talisker but with strong wood-fire (as opposed to maritime) peat and charcoal flavor like Ardbeg. The peach and tea on the aroma is a nice bonus. This is priced about right in the low-$40s and stands up to comparisons with single malts in that price-range although it’s not going to replace Laphroaig 10 for the mid-range peat spot in my cabinet. Having never tasted real 200 year-old Lossit I can’t say how accurately this depicts the lost distillery’s character but it definitely doesn’t stray far from modern peated malts already on the market.
307,Lost Republic Straight Bourbon - Another in a long line of sourced whiskies with marketing story and packaging proudly proclaiming its California heritage while actually being distilled in Indiana. At least these barrels were aged at a warehouse in Healdsburg California (aka Napa) giving them some vestiges of individuality. In fact while the label says it was distilled in Indiana the web says it’s a blend of bourbons from distilleries in Indiana Tennessee and California. This blend “comprised of 75% corn 21% rye and 4% barley” spent 3 years and 2 months in new American oak barrels with #2 char and is bottled at 45.5% ABV in small batches of 600 bottles (that’s 2 barrels at a time). Expect batches to vary! My review is from batch LRB13 (hand-written on the label a nice personal touch).As for the providence of the whisky the Indiana portion is almost certainly made at the ubiquitous MGP facility. The Tennesse portion could be from Prichard’s Distillery which is (to my knowledge) the only Tennessee distillery large enough to sell contract whiskey and which is making bourbon on pot stills and without using the Lincoln County Process. The California portion is anybody’s guess.Nose Spicy but with a lingering waft of acetone. Rye-centric spice cabinet notes of clove cinnamon star anise fenugreek and fennel seed pervade but one must continually ignore the nail-polish remover entwined with them. Very slightly grassy this reminds me a bit of Buffalo Trace in its leanness. Not much sweetness at all.Palate Thin body. Moderate tongue burn. Flavor is fleeting mostly in the realm of cinnamon candy and cake batter.Finish Medium-long. A lot of sugar (caramel/toffee) appears on the finish with a maple-tinged funugreek focus and fades without much bitterness.With Water A few drops of water heighten the nose tickle and do little to reduce the acetone. The palate might be a little thicker and the tongue burn less but nothing much is achieved by adding water.Overall This is an oddball. On the nose it smells like Buffalo Trace bourbon (vegetal) mixed with straight rye (spice) and aged about 2 years less than it should be (acetone). On the palate it tastes like commodity whisky (bland). On the finish it mutates into a sweet maple-y concoction with great oak/sugar balance and no bitterness. For the first time (ever) I find myself rushing through the stages of smelling and tasting so that I can relive the finish.Since nobody buys a bottle of whisky for its finish alone and because when mixed into cocktails this is indistinguishable from Buffalo Trace (which is $8 cheaper) I cannot recommend Lost Republic’s current batches of bourbon. Let’s see what happens when they get a few more years on those California-aged barrels.
308,Lost Spirits – Leviathan II – Old Man And The Sea Cask - For background on this distillery see this post about my visit.My visit to Lost Spirits distillery in Salinas CA was a rewarding experience. I learned a lot from distiller/owner Bryan Davis and also had an opportunity that few whisky consumers have to sample a distillery-only single cask bottling. Often in Scotland scotch distilleries will keep back one or more special single casks to bottle and sell as perks for distillery visitors. A bottle that can’t simply be picked up at the local liquor shop or duty-free store is both a great memento and a special experience for the distillery visitor.After trying Bryan’s range of bottlings I was fascinated with the Distillery-Only Series bottle of Leviathan II nicknamed “The Old Man And The Sea Cask” which Bryan said was named for its unexpected briny/smoked fish notes. It’s instructive that even a careful chemist like Bryan can be surprised by the wide variation in results between casks even when two or more casks undergo exactly the same environmental forces and processes and are filled with new make from the same recipe.Leviathan II is an effort to improve upon the original Leviathan I (and perhaps to combat its mixed reviews) by maturing the same distillate in special casks. According to Bryan he “went through Hell and back” to obtain a few of the rarely-available empty casks previously filled with California late-harvest Semillon. These are California’s answer to French Sauternes a white wine grape affected by the botrydis fungus which concentrates the wine’s sugars and yields a sweet honeyed dessert wine when fermented.Bryan peat-smokes 100% California malted barley with “coarse cut” Canadian peat in his handmade smoker. This malt is distilled on the crazy Lost Spirits wooden pot still and filled into those Semillon casks. The result is bottled around 53% ABV without chill-filtration or coloring. The bottle says “under 4 years” which is required by law but the whisky is likely much younger than that.Take all that madness and then consider that Bryan singled out this cask for its special character. I wanted to see what happens when an already individualistic whiskey is singled out as a single-cask bottling for being even more individualistic!Nose The Semillon punches through the haze of swampy peat with a laser-focused cherry tartness. The peat itself is intense and fungal heavy on moss industrial solvents and piney compost. Underneath the malt itself is funky in true Lost Spirits style. Musty moulding oak smoked fish and red wine vinegar.Palate Soft on the palate cherry pie and cherry lozenge up front followed by a robust mouth burn. A touch of raw honey burning leaves and dried cranberries.Finish Long. All of the notes from the aroma come back but gentler and under more control. Here there is a slight suggestion of the sweetness of the semillon without as much tartness. The peat rides through starting smoky and ending with moss and freshly-dug earth. On the tail end menthol.With Water A generous dose of water reveals some barnyardy aromas – spoiled hay and livestock – and dials up the nose tickle. The water renders a creamier mouthfeel and reveals more barley on the tongue however it emphasizes bitterness on the finish that just wasn’t there at full proof. I think it’s better full strength. Note though that a long rest (30 minutes) integrates the water and yields a lot more sweetness. This is worth experimenting with.Overall As with the other Lost Spirits offerings Leviathan II is neither a drink for the faint of heart nor the seeker of refinement. Eccentric and bold gamey and tart this malt takes the usual Lost Spirits weirdness and encases it in a tart candy coating. Remember Warheads sour candy? I think it’s interesting – and slightly disappointing – that the sweet wine doesn’t bring much sweet character to this malt and is instead responsible for the sour grape notes. Perhaps a port maturation is in order? Either way if you’re looking for variety and excitement in your whiskey this place is a gold mine. Lost Spirits continues to create otherworldly spirit with truly alien characteristics.Please note that if you do visit the distillery you must bring a non-California driver’s license in order to purchase bottles. Crazy liquor laws…
309,Lost Spirits Abomination - The mad scientist Bryan Davis is back fresh off a rum-making spree a dip into the icy waters of the distillery technology industry and in the midst of a relocation to sunny L.A. and he’s released a pair of whiskies very much in line with Lost Spirits’ previous editions. These however are different in an important way. Rather than mashing and distilling his own barley and using some wacky local peat Bryan has gone old-school and bought actual Islay whisky to perform his depraved alchemical rituals upon. Sourced from an undisclosed distillery on Islay (his only hint it’s not Caol Ila) and rapid-aged in his biochemical reactor using American oak staves that have been toasted (or charred see below) and soaked in late-harvest Riesling.This aptly-named Abomination is bottled at a hefty 54% ABV without added coloring or chill filtration and comes in two varieties. The Crying of the Puma uses oak staves that have been toasted prior to the Riesling treatment while The Sayers of the Law uses staves that have been charred first. It’s worth noting that nobody has ever released a whisky finished in late-harvest Riesling casks (or any Riesling casks to my knowledge) because there is no such thing. Riesling is kept in stainless-steel tanks after fermentation and is not aged in wood. To create this effect Bryan sourced used wine barrel oak staves stripped the tannins from the wood in his lab amongst bubbling beakers and during a lightning storm (OK that last bit is just in my head) toasted/charred the staves and then soaked them in late-harvest Riesling before using them in his reactor.I asked Bryan about that Islay whisky and learned something interesting. If you go to Islay and ask for new-make (as independent bottlers often have contracts to fill tankers with new-make spirits) you find that the arcane laws make this severely difficult. The same if you ask for aged whisky past the 3 year mark (and thus legally “scotch whisky”). However it appears to be much easier to acquire “proto-whisky” in the 12- to 18-month range and that it is often “teaspooned” with another distillery’s whisky to avoid complications with brand identity and labeling. One can thus extrapolate that Abomination is between 12 and 18 months of age and has been rapidly-aged for a week or two in Bryan’s reactor. This explains why the bottle says things like “Heavily Peated Malt” and “Spirits distilled from 100% malted barley”. Tellingly the word “whisky” appears nowhere on the label.In classic Bryan Davis tongue-in-cheek humor the names of the two bottlings are chapter names from H. G. Wells’s The Island of Doctor Moreau. Fitting.Nose At first one thinks “Oh golden raisins” and then one is socked in the nose by a potent barrage of peat. This is iodine-soaked briny seaweed peat. Unlike your typical Islay malt however this one is wrapped in a warm blanket of gooey caramel and drizzled with a white port reduction. By aroma alone I would peg this at around 15 years of age and having spent time in new oak.Palate Thin body. Significant tongue burn (duh it’s 54% ABV) that resolves into briny peat toasted nori (seaweed) oaky sweetness (caramel).Finish Very long. Warming. Tobacco (think a smoky cigar lounge) earthy fungal peat and a fading hint of clove.With Water A few drops of water spike the aroma with fresh young peat and intensify the caramel notes. The palate becomes a little bitter and has more spice notes like clove and cinnamon as does the finish. Only add water if you need to proof it down.Overall A fully-formed expression of Islay peat with a mature oaky intensity not often experienced in that category even with older Islays. The restrained sweetness of the oaky caramels and the (very very faint) raisiny fruit from the Riesling-seasoned wood balance very well against the youthful vibrancy of the peat. If someone forced me to guess the provenance of this whisky blind I would say it was 15 year-old Laphroaig finished in white port -seasoned new oak. I would be wrong of course about everything except (maybe?!) the Laphroaig. I think it’s Laphroaig.Nose Coffee roasted cocoa nibs and sooty smoky peat. The aroma is drier than The Crying of the Puma and the caramel notes are darker like burnt caramel or hard-crack toffee (without the nuts). The seaweed character of the peat is harder to discern here and I’m not sure I would have identified it as maritime peat if I hadn’t tried The Crying of the Puma first.Palate Thin body. Black coffee followed by a significant tongue burn (54% ABV) that fades to reveal iodine pungent tidepools (sea brine and weird fermenting seaweeds) wafting smoke and more burnt caramel. A tad bitter.Finish Very long. Warming. A repeat of the notes from the palate – more black coffee burnt caramel and billowing briny peat smoke.With Water A few drops of water make the aroma sootier but otherwise leave it unchanged. On the finish there is an added tart note. As with The Crying of the Puma add water only if you prefer it proofed down.Overall This has everything that The Crying of the Puma has except it is coated in a thick layer of sooty charcoal and roasted coffee flavors. The interplay between the “dark roast” notes and the Riesling comes across as an interesting dark chocolate-covered cherry type of note but is otherwise hard to identify. I would never have guessed a wine-cask origin if tasting blind.Of the two I prefer The Crying of the Puma for its sweeter aspect and its clarity. They are both excellent especially when you realize what exactly they are and how amazing it is that they come to be in this state of maturity whilst being so young as to be legally “spirits” and not “whisky”.
310,Lost Spirits Ouroboros - For background on this distillery see this post about my visit.Ouroboros is one of three new expressions from “mad chemist” Bryan Davis released recently along with Leviathan II and Bohemian Bonfire. The symbology is appropriate the snake eating its own tail is an emblem of re-creation of constant growth and renewal and the cyclical nature of the universe. Bryan’s whisky is constantly changing – not just via his experimental distillation and maturation techniques but by the liquid’s very nature as an endlessly complex alchemical stew of flavors and aromas. Every glass of Ouroboros brings a new experience for me a new opportunity to be confused amazed disgusted and rewarded in turn. My last glass was redolent of tobacco my current glass speaks of forest fungi. My next glass? Unknowable.Ouroboros is peated American single malt whiskey. It is double-distilled on Bryan’s insane wooden pot still from 100% California malted barley which had been heavily smoked in Bryan’s homemade smoker using California black peat sourced from a river delta near Mt. Diablo. This new-make was then aged in used oak barrels that Bryan re-charred and speed-seasoned (using air pressure!) with sherry. Bryan won’t tell you the age but it’s less than four years old. Probably a lot less. For once it doesn’t matter – this needs neither more time to mellow nor more time to pick up flavors from the cask. It’s bottled without added coloring or chill-filtration at a cask strength of 53% ABV.Color Bryan does not color his whiskies and this one is downright mahogany in color.Nose Peat dominates but not in the familiar Islay style of sea-inflected vegetation. This is mossy and mushroomy. The smell is similar to the decaying of a felled tree covered in lichen and varieties of fungus. Yes there is smoke but it underlines rather than head-lines. Integral to the aroma is a dense sticky resiny sherry quality quite unlike the venerable sherried malts of Scotland. This sherry is more like a reduction – stewed plums and berry preserves caramelized to the point of burning – and integrates nicely with the oddball peat. Beneath the interplay of peat and sherry lies the heart of what Lost Spirits is all about the malt distillate is unusual even off-putting in its individuality. Like the scent of a “sour” (wild yeast) beer there is a cacophony of bacterial and yeasty aromas. Among these are mid-ferment beer ripe gym socks souring raw milk sauerkraut and deeper mysterious scents that I am unequal to the task of identifying. The whole is mind-boggling and challenging not for the faint of heart nor the quick-to-judge. I have not smelled depth of this kind in a whisky or whiskey before.Palate At cask strength this is expectedly potent but I would not call it rough. The first impression is of reduced marsala meaty and winey and savory. The funky malt and funkier peat are released from their cloak of sherry and confound the palate as they did the nose. Fascinating and puzzling.Finish Very long. This is the type of peat that sticks with you and shows up hours later while you’re brushing your teeth. A bit of fresh fruit – berries – linger for a short time but the majority is peat and some silky tannins which are in no way bitter.With Water A few drops of water do a good job of separating the three distinct elements on the nose the sherry diminishes the peat becomes distinct and the malt announces itself. It also adds a bit of nuttiness to the palate and amps the smoke in the early part of the finish. Do try with and without water. When diluted down to around 40% the peat’s smokiness dominates the nose. All of the weirdness is on display at this proof but it loses something of its togetherness.Overall This is not whiskey you sit on the back porch and relax with. This is thinking whiskey. This whiskey challenges coerces and redefines itself. It beckons you to examine it deeper and then smacks you in the face with a sweaty gym sock. This is the kind of whiskey that you finish a glass of and then realize you have no idea what just happened. You want another glass but you have to admit you’re a little scared of it. I thank the malt gods that I had experienced the funkiness of sour beer before sampling Bryan’s work. I honestly cannot say if I would have been as accepting without that preparatory experience. I can very easily understand why so many bottles of Seascape and Leviathan I were returned to K&L after their debut – anyone buying a bottle without tasting it first runs the serious risk of hating it right away. That drives my rating decision Try it before you buy it or buy it with an open mind and an adventurous spirit.It should be noted that my tasting experience is skewed by the fantastic one-on-one explanation Bryan gave me about his philosophy his methods and his dual love for peat and distilling experimentation. This is definitely a whiskey that benefits from context and I fear that a lot of potential fans may be turned off without this kind of context. It’s probably also impossible to find outside of California and be warned that California laws prohibit Bryan from selling spirits on-premises unless you have an out-of-state driver’s license. Tours are available via appointment lostspirits.net.
311,Lost Spirits Umami - For background on this distillery see this post about my visit.Lost Spirits the brainchild of “mad chemist” Bryan Davis is churning out some new releases after the tragic planned demolition of his eccentric wooden still. Thanks to the kindness of Bryan and Joanne I was able to sample one of the new efforts Umami.Umami is the Japanese term for the ‘fifth’ flavor detectable by human taste receptors (the others being sweet salty sour and bitter). It specifically refers to a class of chemicals known as glutamates which includes the semi-infamous food additive monosodium glutamate or MSG. These compounds which are prevalent in foods such as soy sauce tomatoes seaweed aged cheeses and fish are often described as ‘savory’ or ‘meaty’.Lost Spirits’ Umami is one of several projects that has resulted from Bryan experimenting with the use of Pacific Ocean water in fermentation. He says (and I don’t even pretend to understand the biochemical interactions at play here) that “…salt changes cell wall structures in yeast changes the life cycle changes the budding. Also changes all boiling points completely alters the entire process.” I can just picture Bryan rubbing his hands together and yelling “It’s Alive!” If you’re curious about salt’s effects on distillation here’s a good explanation and also a good read on Umami.Despite the use of Pacific Ocean seawater in early trials the actual retail production of Umami uses a sea-salt-and-water brine not actual (read teeming with unpredictable life) seawater. Umami is distilled from a mash of domestic malted barley which Bryan smoked in his homemade smoker with Canadian peat and fermented with the aforementioned brine. The distillate is then aged in refill French Oak casks that Bryan seasoned with sherry (something he’s done before with previous releases) for “under 4 years” (legalese for he’s not telling how long) and bottled at 59% ABV without coloration or chill filtration.Note that this malt whisky is a small-batch combination of distillate from both Lost Spirits’ ill-fated wooden pot still and their new tiny copper pot still.Nose Maybe it’s the octopus on the label but my senses are screaming ‘ocean’ – particularly brine and a dense meaty seaweed. This isn’t just crispy nori this is dripping seawater-soaked seaweed with little pods hanging off of it. While the primary sensation is of tidepools and the feeling of ocean water in your sinuses there are other layers – a figgy raspberry jam element salted caramel smoked roe and a core of white miso. This isn’t named Umami for nothing.Palate After a delayed (and intense) tongue burn the peat really shines through. Driftwood bonfires and clambakes with a lot of hay and bracken.Finish Long. Really long. Some of the sweet notes from the nose return here along with jalapeno jelly nutmeg smoked salt and a mouth-drying dose of oak tannin. There is mercifully no bitterness to speak of. Fades (after a good long while) with dusty dry spices and a touch of creosote.With Water A generous dose of water reveals much more peat smoke in the aroma but seems to smash together all of the ‘layers’ into a bit of a muddle. It makes the tongue burn far easier to handle though and brings out a little more caramel sweetness and maybe some taffy. I suggest giving this a good deep contemplation with your nose before proofing it down.Overall This certainly has the hallmarks of Bryan Davis’s work – funky and offbeat its flavor pairings are just as unlikely (and just as successful) as salt with caramel and bacon with maple syrup. There’s also a bit more refinement here – a step back and an attention to detail that makes Umami while still challenging not nearly as wild-eyed and eccentric as previous releases.You might wonder about the ‘Recommended’ score below. Lost Spirits is not widely-distributed so I can’t really call it a “Must Try” – but if you’ve become bored with single-cask peated scotch and want to experience something truly new and different in whisky this (or any Lost Spirits malt whisky) is a ‘Must Try’ for you. Also a craft cask-strength whisky with this much depth for $60 is a steal.I would be remiss if I didn’t emphasize that all of Lost Spirits’ whiskies (and this one is no exception) are very challenging and not for the unadventurous drinker. If you aren’t fully familiar with cask-strength peated whiskies (such as Laphroaig or Ardbeg) you should really start there before taking these on. Even then you may need to spend several sessions figuring out all of the craziness within.
312,Lot 40 Canadian Rye Whisky 2012 Release - I wish I could say that after tasting through all that blended Canadian whisky that I personally discovered this gem. That would be dishonest though and if you can’t trust something you read on the Internet then what can you trust? Seriously though I had it on good authority from David Driscoll at K&L that Lot 40 was worth a close look so I bought a bottle blind. It’s also significantly more expensive than any other Canadian whisky I’ve reviewed and it’s not a blend so it’s not fair to compare to the cheapo blends below. Still THIS is what I wanted – really good Canadian whisky available in the US. It’s happening!This guy was Whisky Advocate’s 2013 Canadian Whisky of the year. Apparently available (even in the States) previously it disappeared from production for over a decade and sparked a global bottle hunt among Canadian whisky drinkers in the know. Bottler Corby Distilleries has re-launched Lot 40 with its 2012 Release. The whisky is distilled at the Hiram Walker plant from a mashbill of 90% rye and 10% malted rye using a copper pot still. This is the real deal. This is what Canadian whisky (should be) all about and thank goodness it’s available in the US!Update 3/31/2015 David D. over at K&L conducted an interview with Hiram Walker Master Blender Don Livermore and he had this fascinating tidbit to share about the production of Lot 40 It’s 100% rye whisky. The rye is passed once through a column still and then a pot still. When yeast ferments it makes fruity floral green grass soapy and sulfur characters. We can control the fermentation’s temperature the nitrogen level the pH grain levels or a number of other things in order to influence the yeast to make these characteristics. We do a warm ferment that helps the yeast grow quickly and ultimately make alcohol quickly. After 3 days of fermentation we achieve 8% abv. When you put that fermented rye mash once through the column still you keep the grain character (spicy) as well as the floral the fruity the green grass and the soapy notes that yeast has made. […] We then pass the column distilled liquid through a pot still for Lot 40 [which strips out the grass and soapy notes]. for more on the topic of distillation of Canadian whisky at Hiram Walker read the whole interview.Nose Oh my God. Delicate cherry blossoms crushed eucalyptus sticky dried golden delicious apples. No dusty spice cabinet. Instead the “rye spices” smell like freshly-opened seed pods of clove and allspice. I now know what rye whisky is supposed to smell like. This is -amazing-.Palate Soft. The spices are slightly more predominant on the tongue with clear cinnamon and clove. Gingersnap cookies. Soft rye grain with a touch of oakiness and some vanilla-flecked caramel. Nice but not as earth-shattering as the aroma.Finish Mild medium-length. The eucalyptus returns with a ghost of fresh mint leaves. Finishes totally devoid of bitterness.With Water Oddly a few drops of water dulls the aroma. The palate is sweeter with some nice fleshy stone fruit. I’d avoid the water here just because of the disservice it does to that lovely aroma.Overall This isn’t saying much but this is the best Canadian whisky I’ve ever had. It’s also the best nose I’ve ever smelled on anything with rye in it. Hell I’ll say it it’s even better (on the nose) than any bourbon I’ve tried including those from Van Winkle. The palate doesn’t quite live up to the promise of the nose (what can?) but is soft and subtle in its own right. The finish is sedate and unobtrusive. Really though I could sit here and smell this all night.If you like bourbon rye Canadian whisky or American craft whisky then you now have a mission. You must smell this whisky. Find a bar that carries it a friend with a bottle a retailer who will pour you a sample under the table or a public tasting event. Buy a bottle if you have to. You must smell this whisky.
313,Mackinlay’s Rare Old Highland Malt Whisky - Ok I usually review whiskies that are in my own price range. That’s under $100 although I consider anything over $50 to be a bit of a stretch. Once in awhile though I get an opportunity to taste something wholly out of my budget – and who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? Thanks to Patricia at The Baddish Group for sending me a sample of Mackinlay’s Rare Old Highland Malt Whisky.If you do any reading online or in magazines about whisky it would have been hard to avoid all of the media coverage of the recovery of three sealed bottles of whisky from Sir Ernest Shackleton’s base camp in Antarctica earlier this year. Several crates of these bottles along with other artifacts from the failed 1907 ‘Nimrod’ expedition have lain perfectly preserved in sub-zero temperatures for a century. When Whyte & Mackay owners of the now-defunct Mackinlay & Co. brand which adorns the bottles got the chance to examine the contents (under carefully-controlled conditions the bottles themselves are headed back to the site) they did what any sensible corporation would do make a replica and sell it for $200!Seriously though luminary master blender Richard Paterson brought his blending talents to bear on a re-creation of the style from the late 1800s analysis showed the preserved bottles to be 5 to 10 year-old single malt likely from the Glen Mhor distillery using barley smoked with a little bit of Orkney peat and aged in ex-sherry barrels. The re-creation contains some Glen Mhor (a closed distillery) some Dalmore and an undisclosed mixture of other malts. Retailing at around $175 this is not whisky for the faint of wallet although you could console yourself with the knowledge that 5% of the proceeds are donated to the Antarctic Heritage Trust which oversees the maintenance and protection of heritage sites like Shackleton’s camp.Nose Very Highland in style – fruity honeyed and light. Faint hint of peat – like rosemary smoke – with some unctuous peach and raw honey. Also something vibrant and young clementine oranges and fresh crushed mint. A little rubber. More nose tickle than I’d expect even after a long rest in the glass. This one really crawls up your nose.Palate Quite full body. Creamy. Orange blossoms up front with honeycomb and raspberry coulis. Next it gets malty showing gingerbread and shortbread cookies. Finally it gets slightly nutty.Finish Long and satisfying. Residual honey a little drying tannin some maple syrup and hard candies. Wraps up with peanut butter. Excellent finish which really keeps the flavors coming rather than fading off.Overall If I were weathering a snowstorm at the South Pole I’d sure like to have several cases of this stashed under my cabin. Or better yet under my bed! Eminently Highlander with loads of honey and sticky-sweet candied fruits a touch of smoke a hint of rubber and lots of flavor. I’m too poor to buy $200 bottles of anything but if the story captures your attention and the thought of cracking open a $200 bottle of spirits doesn’t make you break out in a cold sweat you won’t be disappointed. I’m guessing a large number of sales will be primarily to collectors as there are a limited number of bottles (50000) available.A few drops of water reveal a little roasted peanut on the nose make the palate a lot more malty with brown sugar and cereals and don’t seem to alter the finish. Try a few drops if you’re curious but I think it drinks just fine without.
314,Maker’s 46 Bourbon - Maker’s 46 which was the company’s first addition to its regular lineup is basically Maker’s Mark (wheated bourbon aged 6 to 6.5 years) with an additional 10 weeks of aging with 10 “seared” French Oak barrel staves inserted into the casks and bottled at an extra 2% ABV (at 47%). The process is done during the winter in the coolest parts of the warehouse to minimize the movement of whiskey through the wood. This treatment (the 46th attempt at creating a successful recipe hence the name) is supposed to intensify the vanilla and caramel notes of the bourbon without adding additional bitterness from barrel tannin. Maker’s 46 is bottled at 47% ABV (a missed marketing opportunity that) and sold at a very reasonable $30 to $35 a bottle a modest increase over the standard Maker’s Mark at $25 (or so).Nose Strong corn character with aprioct cherrywood smoke vanilla and marzipan. Very oaky.Palate Thin body. Hot-ish. Maple extract with a heavy wood (oak) flavor. Sweet almonds and burnt caramel but very dry. Charcoal.Finish Medium-long. Bitter barrel char. Dry and astringent. Some nice caramelized crème brûlée notes on the tail end and while there is a sense of bitterness from oak tannin it’s not overt.With Water Water softens the palate and adds some nice peach notes on the tongue. This plays well with a splash of water.Overall It’s okay I guess? A bit dry but without much complexity to offset that leanness. A ton of oak if you’re into that sort of thing. It actually reminds me of the effect that oak “sticks” had when left in the bottle for too long. Maker’s 46 isn’t going to replace anything in my liquor cabinet. Still if you’re a Maker’s fan it’s worth the extra 10 ducats to experience what an extra period of aging with French Oak staves does to the base bourbon.
315,Maker’s Mark Bourbon - Maker’s Mark is a classic American Kentucky Straight Bourbon. There’s really not much point in my reviewing it – there are plenty of die-hard Maker’s fans that aren’t going to care what I have to say on the subject. On the other hand appreciators of a wide range of fine bourbons will continue to think of Maker’s Mark like the Glenlivet of bourbons decent enough in its own way maybe worth mixing cocktails with but something to graduate from.I was curious about Maker’s because it’s a wheater. In a world of high-rye bourbons a mashbill with wheat instead of rye is somewhat uncommon. The Pappys the Wellers Old Fitzgerald Larceny and Maker’s. That’s a pretty short list considering the hundreds of bourbon brands on the market. Wheated bourbons tend to be softer on the palate with more bread-and-cake flavors and fewer spicy cinnamon-and-clove flavors. Maker’s is also distinct for making its own bourbon not slapping a label on bourbon produced at MGP or KBD (see this post for more on that topic).Maker’s mashes “soft red winter wheat” and barley (probably malted for enzymes to kick-start fermentation) along with its corn and ages the bourbon for around 6 years. Unlike most other whiskies Maker’s rotates the barrels between upper and lower floors of the warehouse to even out maturation differences. This would make a “single barrel” of Maker’s Mark less likely to be significantly different than the final bottled product. The brand has been around since 1958 when the first bottle was dipped in red wax to seal it.In 2013 Maker’s Mark was embroiled in a little public relations nightmare when it announced that the brand would be reducing its bottling strength from the iconic 45% ABV to 42% ABV due to production shortages. The media and consumer ****-storm that ensued resulted in the company backpedaling and resuming production of the 45% ABV bottling thus proving that even in the whisky industry consumers have a voice.Nose Classic wheater aroma – soft wheaty grain (like shredded wheat cereal) cherry syrup and a slight band-aid plastic note.Palate Thin body but lots of up-front sweetness. Oaky with loads of vanilla and dried coconut. A bit of young grain mars the progression.Finish Brown sugar corn syrup charcoal and a little bit of mouth-drying tannin.With Water A few drops of water bring a bit of vanilla to the nose but otherwise have no appreciable effect. Water is strictly optional.Overall Well it’s a pretty standard mid-grade bourbon. There are no stand-out elements and even the wheat is only halfheartedly present. I would put this a step or two under W.L. Weller in quality. When mixing a bourbon-centric cocktail I might be inclined to use Maker’s Mark if I don’t want to shell out for something top shelf. The 45% ABV fills out the flavor and keeps it from feeling thin which would be an added bonus in cocktails. It would make a killer julep. I’ve given this a ‘Recommended’ rating because as long as you know what you’re getting $25 for a decent wheated bourbon is not a bad deal.I’d like to point out that this is from a plastic miniature bottle which does not appear to have inflicted any debilitating effect on the whisky. I’m inclined to think that the previous “bad” bourbons I’ve blamed on the plastic miniatures may themselves (or their specific batches) be to blame. Who knows.
316,McAfee’s Benchmark Old No. 8 Bourbon - Usually a 1-liter bottle of bourbon with a nondescript black label and a pricetag of $15 would set off warning bells but some less-cautious part of my brain said “hey even if it’s awful we can make a lot of Old Fashioneds… at like $1 apiece!” Luckily for me it’s not awful. In fact it’s shockingly inexplicably NOT BAD.Before we all join in on a chorus of “ding dong the expensive bourbon witch is dead” (is that too tortured a metaphor?) I have to point out that Benchmark is weirdly good as in it doesn’t really taste that much like bourbon. It’s more like a… thin fruity corn brandy if you will. The specs all add up though. It’s Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (meaning minimum 3 years in new oak barrels) from a sour mash and it’s made by that paragon of bourbon virtue Buffalo Trace. In fact it’s made from the same mashbill as Buffalo Trace the Staggs and Eagle Rare 75% corn 10% rye and 15% barley (for enzymes). Despite the big “8” on the front (for “Old No. 8 Brand”) it’s definitely not 8 years old. I’d guess 3 to 5. It’s bottled at 40% ABV in a bottle with a plastic screw cap. Did I mention it’s $15 a liter? It’s $15 a liter.The Benchmark Old No. 8 brand was purchased by Sazerac (Buffalo Trace) from Seagram in 1992 when it was originally distilled at the Four Roses distillery. Sazerac moved production to the Buffalo Trace Distillery and tacked “McAfee’s” onto the name in honor of the McAfee brothers who surveyed the site of the Buffalo Trace Distillery in 1775 long before it was built.Nose A piercing tangy note of – I kid you not – Bubblicious watermelon bubblegum. That cannot be natural. Fruit punch cotton candy and Sour Patch Kids round out the trip down the candy aisle of my adolescent memory. One-dimensional and almost cloyingly sweet-smelling. Floral.Palate Thin watery body. Sweet corn (cornbread) plain bubblegum marzipan blanched almonds and some light oak.Finish Short. Reminiscent of the aroma – slightly tangy and quite sweet in a high-fructose corn syrup kind of way. Ends quickly with more bubblegum and no bitterness.With Water Water intensifies the weird artificial fruit notes in the aroma and adds a layer of fresh creamed corn on the palate. At 40% this definitely does not need any water.Overall This stuff has a powerful memory trigger for all the sweet fake sugary stuff I ate as a kid. If it weren’t… you know… alcohol it could almost be marketed to children. I would be totally unsurprised to learn that some loophole in the TTB labeling laws had allowed Buffalo Trace to tip a couple of ounces of bubblegum artificial flavoring into each vat. As it stands I have no idea how they got this stuff to taste like this. I said earlier that it barely tastes like bourbon with that wateriness and weird candy notes so don’t buy this if you’re expecting a cheap-but-solid bourbon.At any rate it’s one of the cheapest bourbons on the planet and it’s super easy to drink even neat. It’s light enough to shrink in on itself in a cocktail so if you like to taste the bourbon in your Old Fashioned you might want to look a shelf or two higher up. If you don’t care about that this is definitely not swill. How’s that for a recommendation?
317,McCarthy’s Oregon Single-Malt - Steve McCarthy of Clear Creek Distillery in Portland Oregon is an interesting guy. He’s got lots of stories about his unexpected role as a pioneer in the American craft distillation movement and he’s clearly passionate about distillation and the products he makes. Clear Creek produces a wide array of fruit brandies (eaux de vies) using local Oregon fruit including Golden Delicious apples and Bartlett pears from its own orchards. What drew me to a tasting that he recently hosted at K&L in Redwood City was his single malt. Yes a malted barley American Whiskey made with imported Islay peat. Steve says Oregon Single-Malt is an appellation that he “made up” before Oregon legislature knew what he was up to!Steve buys the malted barley from the maltings at Port Ellen a Diageo facility as does just about every other distillery on Islay. That means he’s distilling with the same malt that goes into Lagavulin Laphroaig and others. Widmer Brothers a Portland microbrewery makes his wash and he distills it on his tiny German eau-de-vie copper stills. The distillate goes into large 400-liter barrels made from air-dried Oregon white ‘scrub’ oak. The first year is spent in old oft-reused barrels. It is then racked into slightly newer barrels for the second year and then spends the final year in brand-new oak. It’s not quite a solera process but it does the job oaky but not too woody. It’s bottled at 46% ABV.Nose Meaty and full of peat – a blast of it in fact. A campfire of burning pine needles with an interesting depth of nuances. No iodine or fishiness just sappy resiny peat mild oak and an undercurrent of mildly sweet barley. Smells like an 8 or 10 year-old Caol Ila or Bowmore with a little more ppm.Palate Soft and warming. Lots of nice malty sugar. Rice candy. Peat is not intense and the smoothness on the palate belies its youth. Tastes well-crafted.Finish Pine and peat pervade but the youth shows with evaporating raw alcohol and a vein of oaky bitterness. Lingers like most Islays.Overall Amazing that a three year-old whisky distilled on a tiny brandy still in Oregon can smell and taste like an 8 or 10 year-old Islay single malt scotch. Sure the imported barley has a lot to do with that but Steve McCarthy’s attention to detail careful (and economical) use of oak and small slowly-running stills all come through in the product which somehow tastes handcrafted. I could wish it had a few more years in barrel to smooth out the wrinkles and improve that finish but this is clearly an excellent product from a master distillery. You are still paying the ‘craft’ premium here $50 is a lot for three years of aging but if you’re looking to see what the ‘craft’ revolution is all about this is a great place to start.Update 4/4/2021 I haven’t been keeping up with Clear Creek Distillery since I wrote this review 9 years ago. I have heard reports that McCarthy’s malt can have some batch variation which can mean your second bottle might not be as impressive as your first. I recently tasted a sample in a blind tasting and while I don’t have enough notes to publish a full review I can say that I found it heavily iodine/medicinal/chemical to the point of almost smelling like urine (sorry). I also found that its lack of balancing sweetness and development of undesirable ashy/tar notes were hard to get past. It did not score well in our blind tasting. In light of the batch variation I have moved this down to a “Try Before Buy” rating specifically you should try to taste the same batch that you’re intending to buy if possible.A word on craft pricing These are slightly murky waters. Does it make sense to pay more for one company’s product simply because the nature of that company’s business model makes their whiskey more expensive to produce? Where’s the balance between pricing driven by costs-and-margins and pricing driven by competition? I was (and still am) skeptical about paying new Islay distillery Kilchoman’s prices for what was essentially really tasty new-make. McCarthy’s similarly is produced slowly in small quantities to exacting standards. It uses imported barley (not cheap) contracted wash (not cheap) custom-made barrels (not cheap) and is necessarily a niche product that cannot achieve efficiency via economies of scale in either production or distribution. Here’s the rub it has to taste better than the factory-produced lower-priced competition. If I make one bottle a day of hand-crafted dragonfruit eau-de-vie on a solid gold 20-gallon pot still and age it in 5-liter barrels made from solid mahogany… I shouldn’t expect to make up my costs by charging $2000 a bottle unless it tastes like $2000 a bottle. McCarthy’s at least tastes worth it. For all those other craft distillates out there – I say they have to pass the same test.
318,McKenzie Bottled-in-Bond Wheated Bourbon - Today I bring another American craft whiskey brand that… and I hate that I have to specify this… actually makes its own whiskey! Finger Lakes Distilling (Burdett NY DSP-NY-15020) is a small farm distillery located in the Finger Lakes Wine Country region of New York state and has been making vodkas gins and other spirits since July 2009. Most of their production now goes into whiskies They have a couple of bourbons and a rye that is suddenly on my “to taste” list. There’s also a white whiskey and an upcoming single malt.The distillery uses local New York grains milled using their on-site hammer mill. The mash for the Wheated Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon – 70% local corn 20% red winter wheat 10% malted barley – is double-distilled using a Vendome continuous still and copper thumper (basically a secondary spirit still) although the company also has a Holstein copper pot still which they use for one line of “pot still” whiskey made from a mash of grains somewhat in the Irish style. The McKenzie line of whiskies are distilled to a relatively lower proof and are barreled at a very low 100 proof.The Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon is aged in new charred oak casks for a minimum of 4 years and is then bottled at 50% ABV without chill filtration. Expect to find it for around $45.Nose Unctuous wheated bourbon with heavy notes of baked goods (coffee cake) roasted coffee beans chunk charcoal pecan pie and molasses. Minimal nose tickle for 100 proof.Palate Soft medium bodied. Heavy tongue burn. Chocolate-covered cherries cacao nibs blackberry jam. Prominent oak. Complex.Finish Long. Slightly bitter black coffee cherry liqueur (or is it cough syrup?). This lingers. Nice.With Water A few drops of water amplify the cherries – making them fresh – and adds tartness. The palate retains its body but is brighter. The finish is a little sweeter and more in balance. I very much recommend water with this bourbon.Overall This doesn’t share a lot of notes with other notable wheated bourbons but it does have a distinct and unique flavor profile that I really appreciate. The notes are heavier and darker than similar whiskies with a lot of coffee and chocolate and oak. It reminds me a little of Westland although those are malts not bourbons. McKenzie is kind of a category of its own and I think it’s worth tasting if you’re at all interested in the modern American whiskey scene. For what it’s worth $45 is not a bad price for a well-made “craft” bourbon these days especially at 100 proof. Well done.
319,Michter’s US*1 Bourbon - Michter’s is an old name. The brand was founded in the 1950s at the legendary Bomberger’s Distillery in Pennsylvania but claims heritage to a long line of Pennsylvania distillation that goes back to a (probably apocryphal) story about George Washington ordering whiskey from the area to enliven his troops during the Revolutionary War. The brand name dropped into disuse and was renewed by Chatham Imports in the 1990s where industry contacts allowed the brand to distill its recipe under contract at an undisclosed Kentucky distillery. The recipe incidentally includes not only a specific strain of yeast and a mash bill of 79% corn 11% rye and 10% barley but the unusual choice of filling barrels at 103 proof (instead of the more cost-effective 120+ proof). That would have been the end of the story but Michter’s built a full-scale industrial distillery in Shively Kentucky and began distilling bourbon in 2016. Even though the new distillery is large Michter’s will still be using small batches of around a dozen barrels to maintain quality control.Without an age statement there’s no way of knowing when the new juice will be ready for the shelves but it will be at least three or four more years. I grabbed a sample from a friend’s bottle to do the following review which is obviously from the “under contract” distillate.Nose Maple syrup. Heavy corn syrup and oaky notes with caramelized sugars (toffee) cherry bitters and oak varnish or furniture polish. Heady but without a strong nose tickle.Palate Syrupy body. An initial impression of maple sugar candies followed by a strong tongue burn (a bit hot for 45%). Through the haze there are cinnamon red-hots maple syrup and cocktail bitters (Angostura). A vague hint of vegetal grassiness but obscured by the heaviness of the oak and sugars. Finish Medium-long. Cherry lozenge. A hint of charcoal but without any bitterness.With Water Several drops of water increases the nose tickle and adds grassiness. On the tongue the water draws out some nutty notes like toasted pecans but thin the body. The finish is also grassier. Take or leave water with this one.Overall This is a quintessential bourbon. It has all of the hallmarks of a low-rye mid-proof bourbon cinnamon sweets big oak corn syrup cherry notes bitter charcoal and a little youthful grassiness. If this were $20 I’d be calling it the value of the century. At $40 I’d pass because it doesn’t elevate itself beyond that “big basic bourbon” category. There is hope that Michter’s new facility will enable the brand to justify itself on the shelf with either a lower price due to economies of scale or a better product through finer-grained control.
320,Milford Single Malt (10 year) - Single malt from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand occupies an odd part of the market here in the US where the burgeoning whiskymaking region is making waves in the media winning awards and generally accumulating acclaim (it reminds me of the start of the Japanese whisky craze). However the whiskies are exuberantly expensive probably due to the expense of importing the small-scale low-volume products from literally across the globe. In other words I’d love to taste and review an array of down under whiskies – many of the best ones on the island of Tasmania – but I just can’t justify the expense.Milford a single malt aged in ex-bourbon casks was distilled at the now-closed Willowbank Distillery on New Zealand’s South Island. The distiller started distilling in 1969 and closed in 1997 after changing hands between Seagram and Fosters. Small amounts of the distillery’s output were being released by the New Zealand Whiskey Collection at ages from 10 to 20. Their website implies that the casks are now all sold but bottles are still cropping up at various retail locations around the globe. This 10 year from a Flaviar tasting box is bottled at 43% ABV.Nose An abundance of tropical fruits namely green banana papaya and pineapple. A slightly grassiness and a nutty (coconut?) undertone. Resting in the glass brings out vanilla sweetness that evokes banana cream pie. Luckily that banana note never turns overripe.Palate Thin body. Mild tongue burn followed by dry oak and vague nut butter. Bitter charcoal and earthiness (peat?) emerge with a bit of banana pudding. Somewhat confused and a little too bitter here for my taste.Finish Medium-short. Dry and mouth-drying somewhat bitter. Coconut returns now dried along with bitter herbs and cut grass. Fades with a suggestion of dark-roast coffee grounds which are… again… bitter.With Water A few drops of water seem to dull the aroma clamping down on those nice fruits. Normally a rest in the glass would fix this but here it doesn’t. The palate is perhaps sweeter and has a bit more sweet-bitter balance. It also has more banana. The finish is also sweeter. If you do decide to add water to this dram make sure to give it a good nosing first.Overall A pleasant flurry of tropical fruits and the near-miss of banana (an aroma note which tends to ruin malts for me) is offset by a muddied palate and an overly-bitter finish. There is not much here that you can’t get from any other single malt with a decade of maturation in ex-bourbon. If you happen to live in a region where this is locally available and cheaper than malt imported from Scotland or if the mystique of trying a dead distillery’s whisky before it’s gone forever appeals to the romantic in you then you’ll find it’s at least as good as any 10-year single-malt scotch you might find. I just wouldn’t seek it out myself or pay a premium for it. $40 is fine $60+ not so much.
321,Monkey Shoulder - Despite the promise of the category “blended malt whiskies” (the artist formerly known as “vatted malt” whiskies) have failed to take off as prophesied. Probably this is because the distinction (a blend involving several malt whiskies but no grain whiskies whereas a “blended scotch” like the ubiquitous Johnnie Walker contains several malt whiskies and one or more grain whiskies) is a little geeky for the average consumer. Compass Box has made a name for the category although not all of CB’s whiskies are blended malts. Wemyss has done a niche business making middle- and high-end blended malts. Finally there is the stalwart of the category William Grant & Sons’ own Monkey Shoulder.I must admit that I’ve done my faithful readers and fellow value-seekers a disservice by taking this long to get around to mentioning Monkey Shoulder. At $25 – $30 if you haven’t tried Monkey Shoulder before you might as well stop reading here and go buy a bottle. It’s not the best whisky in the world but such a solid whisky at such a great price deserves a spot on basically everybody’s home bar.Monkey Shoulder is labelled “Batch 27” as a reference to the original experimental batching of 27 casks. Now runs of Monkey Shoulder are made 27 casks at a time although the batches are not individually numbered. The vatting is a mix of William Grant & Sons’ three distilleries all located in Dufftown in Speyside Glenfiddich The Balvenie and Kininvie. (Kininvie was built in 1990 on the grounds of The Balvenie and makes malt that is mostly used for blends.) All three are from “first-fill” ex-bourbon casks. Sometimes malts from other undisclosed distilleries might be included in the vatting. The ages of the whiskies are unreleased but you can basically assume they’re young.For what it’s worth “Monkey Shoulder” is the nickname for a shoulder injury experienced by maltsters after long hours of manually turning malt on a malting floor.Nose Crisp clear malty grains almost beery. A touch of lemon. No nose-tickle or heavy scents of oak just lightly sweet and round. After a rest in the glass there is a heavy layer of vanilla extract.Palate Initially a wave of lemon peel and caramel accompanied by slight tongue burn. This passes quickly leaving nougat mineral water (almost like tonic with a touch of herbal-like quinine) and vanilla frosting.Finish Short. Nougat all over nutty and sweet but quickly vanishing with a fading hint of dry oaky tannins and a bit of charcoal which leaves the mouth wishing for a little better balance.With Water A few drops of water amplify the citrus in the aroma which (when paired with the vanilla notes) remind me of lemon salt-water taffy. The palate has less burn and tastes a little rounder – more “filled out”. I recommend a little water with this.Overall This is the kind of dram that you show to your friends who think “whisky” means something you add to Coke. Then you tell them it’s only $30. A gentle introduction to the world of malt whisky with a very welcoming profile and a gentle effect on the palate all with a nice array of grains and sweets that showcase what good middle-of-the-road ex-bourbon Scotch malt whisky is like. The finish could be better-balanced and the aroma could use more lemony/fruity top notes but that’s splitting hairs at this price. This also makes it a reliable staple for the “low end” section of your cabinet something you can easily toss back on ice without guilt or mull in a tulip glass after a meal. Or hell you could even make cocktails with it (a practice encouraged by the brand). A jack-of-all-trades if you will but master of none.
322,Mortlach (15 year) – Game of Thrones “Six Kingdoms” - Long-time readers know that I’m a Mortlach fanboy. I won’t say that I emit a high-pitched “Squee!” when I see a good deal on Mortlach but I also won’t say that I don’t… And what a deal this is. Right now (if it’s not already sold out) retailers across the world are being told they can (and should) closeout all of the Game of Thrones editions of Diageo single malts. Some of these were passed off as Black Friday sales but some retailers are just listing them for bottom dollar without much fanfare. The “Six Kingdoms” bottling which was supposed to be the crown jewel of the collection originally retailed for around $150 after the show ended (don’t get me started on that) and then it went on sale for $80 in some places last year. Now you can find it for $60. Talk about a fall from grace. Don’t limit yourself to the Mortlach though you can still find many of the other bottlings from the Game of Thrones series for 50% – 70% off retail. Stock up none of them are bad. Based on reading a few scattered reviews they’re all drinkable but just below the quality of the normal official bottlings from each respective distillery.Why are these bottles going for such crazy markdowns? Simple really Diageo over-estimated the demand for co-branded whisky and bottled too much of it. The show has faded from the public’s memory (the last season didn’t exactly help) and boxes upon boxes of slightly subpar Diageo malt in pretty canisters are sitting in back rooms and warehouses all over the place. They want it gone presumably so they can forget it ever happened. Honestly I feel that it’s a pity because it was a cool idea… but it turns out that slapping an attractive co-branded label on a bottle doesn’t justify a higher retail price if you don’t also put stellar whisky in that bottle. Who knew. Lesson learned? Probably not.I feel like Diageo has a similar lack of strategic vision when it comes to the crown jewel of their treasury Mortlach. The Rare Old was a dismal overpriced disaster (which was ALSO closed out at a severe discount). In fact every good Mortlach I’ve had was from an independent bottler. You wouldn’t think it would be a hard concept Put well-matured sherried Mortlach in bottles with an age statement and sell them for just under what the public considers a fair price for the age. They’ll be allocated everywhere guaranteed.As I climb down off my soapbox I’ll talk about the whisky. It’s Mortlach single malt that has been aged for 15 years in sherry casks and then ex-bourbon barrels. Oddly the label and tin say it was “Finished in ex-bourbon casks” which is a silly way to convey that the whisky started in first-fill sherry (seasoned) casks and then was finished in ex-bourbon. You’d think they’d focus on the sherry. In fact before I looked it up online I thought it just was reracked from ex-bourbon into ex-bourbon! There is no information about whether the whisky has been color-adjusted or if it has been chill-filtered so I always assume that means it has been. The resulting whisky is bottled at a respectable 46% ABV. More information? Please. This is Diageo.Nose Meaty sulfury classic Mortlach. Raisins figs dates. Fresh banana. My brother-in-law suggested that it smelled like pennies which I agree with. It’s coppery but I wouldn’t call it metallic. Fairly complex there’s definitely more deeper in the glass that I’m not picking up on yet. Invites a second and third and fourth nosing…Palate Heavy body. Moderate burn slightly hotter than I’d expect for 46% ABV. Flavorful with a lot of the same notes from the aroma repeated. A chewy date shake with banana cream. Finish Medium length. A bit of barrel char / charcoal appears and while the meaty/coppery flavor persists a lot of the fruit has dropped out. Fades without much evolution aside from a ghost of menthol on the very tail end.With Water A few drops of water initially mute the aroma necessitating a rest in the glass. The water picks out a little more banana on the aroma and adds a layer of sweetness (vanilla / cake frosting) but not much else. The water does make the palate a little more vibrant and adds a tart note there and on the finish… orange peel. Water doesn’t hurt here but try it without water first.Overall This gets a “Recommended” rating but only at the current closeout price. It’s not the best Mortlach I’ve had but it’s still Mortlach with an age statement and that’s not something that you can often just pick off a shelf. I would have been severely disappointed if I had paid the full $150 retail price for this. I paid $80 and I’d say that’s the upper limit of its value. At the current closeout price of $60 I think it’s an excellent deal especially if you’ve never had any Mortlach before.For what it’s worth I bought two more when it dropped to $60.
323,Mortlach Rare Old - Mortlach one of those “only for blends and independents” distilleries that has graduated through sweat and perseverance (or marketing and PR) to official lineup status is actually one of my favorite distilleries. The independent Gordon & MacPhail bottling was a stunner and frequent readers will know that the “heavily sherried and meaty” style is right up my alley.Mortlach is an unusual distillery. Like Springbank it has a unique and convoluted distillation process that involves “partial triple distillation” or “2.7 times distillation” which I won’t even try to describe here. Mortlach has six stills of vastly different types and sizes and has been around since 1823 (and a major component in the Johnnie Walker blends since 1923). Owned by Diageo it has not had much of a presence in the single-malt scene aside from one-offs from independents or special releases from Diageo. Until 2013 that is when Diageo announced new packaging and a corresponding new brand strategy for Mortlach single malt aiming at the premium market. The entry-level “Rare Old” expression with no age statement launched for almost $130 a bottle in the US. Yikes.The Rare Old is neither rare nor old. A non-age statement bottling at an appropriate 43.4% ABV (Why not 43%? Who knows.) from a mixture of ex-sherry and ex-bourbon casks the Rare Old shocked everyone with its initial price – made worse by its bottling at 500ml instead of 700ml in the UK – and then further shocked everyone by diving down the price charts by more than 50% after demand failed to materialize. That’s an unheard-of discount these days with whisky of all sorts costing MORE every month not less. I purchased my 500ml bottle from the UK for $41 (That’s £30 down from its launch price of £55) after missing a sale of the 750ml size at Costco last year for $40! When you consider that some US retailers carried the 750ml Rare Old at launch for $129 that’s quite a fall from grace.Update 7/25/2018 Apparently Diageo has been informed of their mistake in presenting Mortlach in smaller more expensive bottles with less sherry and no age statement and is re-re-launching Mortlach with full-sized bottles and age statements. The Rare Old and other recent NAS releases have been discontinued.Nose Thin and somewhat insubstantial. Clearly very little sherry influence just ex-bourbon (possibly refill). Very light lemon (lemonade) stale biscuit blanched almonds fresh banana and pale honey. Malty but insipid. Does not smell particularly “young” – I would make a wild guess of around 10 years by aroma.Palate Syrupy body. Sweet up front with only moderate tongue burn. A nutty dimension appears – cashews or Brazil nuts – along with a slight bitterness like walnut skins. A reprise of all the notes from the aroma. Well-balanced but unexceptional. No off-notes or “too young” flavors.Finish Short. Malty with a hint of peanut butter. Fades without any additional complexity.With Water A few drops of water add a papery grassy aroma and bring more banana to the palate. I don’t recommend any water with this.Overall An unchallenging dram that one could even call uninteresting. At the price I paid ($41 US for 500ml) I wasn’t terribly disappointed although I would have been a bit miffed to pay $60 for 750ml. Yes I’m aware of how little sense that makes. This bottle has also taught me that what I really like about Mortlach is not its “blank slate” nature but rather its ability to meld with old sherry casks. In that way it feels more like Glenmorangie than Balvenie to me. If you see a full 750ml bottle on sale at the $40 price grab one. It’s worth that. $129? I think not.
324,Nikka From The Barrel – Japanese Whisky - My third taste of Japanese whisky – another blend like the Hibiki 12-year that I recently reviewed – is another home-run hit. This is some damn fine blended whisky. Honestly I would have been unable to distinguish it from single-malt in a blind tasting. Nikka “From The Barrel” is a rather misleading name for a blend of Japanese single malts and Japanese grain whisky (no age statement given) which is married in oak casks (rather than in a giant stainless-steel vat) and then bottled at (or near) cask strength. That (I think) makes this the first time I’ve tasted a cask-strength blended whisky.Asahi Breweries which owns the Nikka brand also owns whisky distilleries Yoichi and Miyagikyo. It’s a good bet those are heavily represented as components in Nikka blends.Alas this (along with most of the rest of the Japanese whisky on the global market) is unavailable in the USA most likely because of the 500ml bottle size (US law allows only certain bottle sizes for retail spirits – 500ml is not on the list). This is a pity especially because it makes it difficult to pin a price-value comparison on the product. If the bottle was repackaged at 750ml for the US market its current UK price would predict a US retail of about $57. That’s a bit hefty for a blend and would drop my recommendation down from a “Must Try” to a “Recommended”. Either way this is equally as good as Hibiki 12 and offers a different array of flavors. Another win for Japanese whisky!Nose Pear drops tropical fruits (kiwi or starfruit or something) and a lot of green banana. The aroma is as expected powerful and tends to crawl up your nose if you get too close. There is complexity to be had here – underneath that domineering banana note resides a nice depth of oaky sweetness and a hefty dose of malt.Palate Wow take small sips of this. Concentrated and robust with loads of tart fruits and brash fiery alcohol. I wouldn’t call this particularly mellow but the oakiness is in excellent balance with the fruit and the high proof makes it dance on the tongue.Finish The dominant note turns to caramel. Very nice. Caramelized banana? A bit of barrel tannin – a hint of bitterness – creeps in at the end.With Water Water adds a bit of vanilla to the nose has a bit of a taming effect on the tongue burn (a bit) and might amp up the tartness on the finish. Water certainly doesn’t hurt here.Overall This is I think my first cask-strength blended whisky. The high proof seems to minimize the flavor of whatever grain whisky is present for me. I get a ton of delectable fruits (most of which are tart my favorite kind of fruit notes in whisky) excellent balance of wood and malt sweetness and a proof that’s just the right amount of intensity straight-up but can also handle some water. Nice stuff even with the dominant banana notes.
325,Nikka Yoichi (10 year) - Japanese whisky is all the rage at the moment. With the dwindling supplies of older scotch stocks and the complete vanishing of bourbon and rye over the age of 12 the trend-setters have turned their attention to the already tiny category of Japanese whisky. The result? The very few bottles that were already being imported into the US have doubled in price and disappeared from shelves. Hibiki 12 (one of my favorites) has dropped the age statement and gone NAS with the new Hibiki Harmony. And now articles with laughable titles like “Japanese Whisky beats Scotch?” and “Is Japanese Whisky Better Than Scotch?” (WSJ) began popping up largely because of Jim Murray’s 2015 “Best World Whisky” award for a Yamazaki bottling. (By the way I say “laughable” not because the answer is “No” but rather because the question is stupid. How can one category of whisky be “better” than another?)Japanese whisky in my thus far limited experience is generally subtle focused and very derivative of its original inspiration scotch whisky. Stand-out Japanese whiskies have been made by aging in Japanese Mizunara oak or plum wine casks which lend a unique Japanese character. While I was very impressed by Nikka from the Barrel and already a big fan of blended whisky Hibiki 12 I disliked the Yamazaki 12 year.The Yoichi distillery is one of Nikka’s two malt distilleries. Established in 1934 by Japanese whisky legend Masataka Taketsuru it produces peated heavy malt for both blending and release as single malt. While Yoichi originally used local peat it now imports most of its peat from Scotland. The distillery is notable for its use of direct coal-fired still a practice so old that it’s not even in use in tradition-bound Scotland anymore. The 10 year is aged in ex-bourbon casks (and allegedly spends some small amount of time in Mizunara casks) and is bottled at 45% ABV. My sample came from my Flaviar Welcome Pack (although current Welcome Packs no longer include it). The sample was collected from a bottle in December 2014.Nose Toasted nori. Flour dumplings and the faintest hint of plum sauce. Quite salty (like Old Pulteney). Roasted salted nuts. Lightly peated but maritime in nature (briny).Palate Definitely salty. Thin on the palate. A little hot. Savory – like Pork Bao – peaty with notes of smouldering hay smoked meats and smoked fish. Malty as well with undercurrents of sweet cereal grains.Finish Long. Clearly peated although the peat seems to run in the salty/seaweed direction rather than the smoky/campfire direction. Fades slowly with evolving notes of crispy fish skin nori seawater and finally iodine.With Water A few drops of water open up a lot of iodine medical tape adhesive band-aids and mutes the savory notes a bit. On the palate it accentuates instead the meaty / pork notes. I would avoid the water with this one unless you find it a little hot and in need of proofing down. Even then don’t add much.Overall Peaty with the same notes as the more seaweed-flecked Islay malts like Laphroaig but without the same intensity. As much as I respect Japanese malts I find this to be a copycat of Scottish malt from Islay. Besides the somewhat-unique salty notes (which can also be found in Old Pulteney) the Yoichi isn’t demonstrably “better” than any 10 year-old peated Scotch while it costs substantially more. I have the same opinion of the peated Amrut single-malt from India which also feels like a copycat.I’m marking it Not Recommended because I feel that the non-enthusiast is better off with a cheaper more widely-available Scottish malt from Islay (Laphroaig Quarter-Cask for example). Still if you’re tired of the same-old peated malts and want to try something else the Yoichi 10 is not a disappointment.
326,"Oban (14 year) - My Scotch journey began with three drams. A Laphroaig 10 an Aberlour A’Bunadh and Oban 14. In that order. It’s no wonder that at the time my impression of the Oban was that it was light and largely flavorless. Anyone assailing his or her taste buds with the peat attack of Laphroaig 10 and following that up with a cask-strength Sherry monster cannot be relied upon to taste anything let alone a floral nuanced highlander like Oban. To illustrate something of the journey I’ve taken in these short few months (I’ve been drinking single malts for 8 months as of the date of this blog post) here are my tasting notes 8 months ago and my tasting notes today

Nose has honey oily green fresh herbs. Super light smoke with seaweed and the lightest touch of smoke.
Palate has honey strawberry jamrosemary baked fruit pies.
Finish is long. Clover honey port wine?

Nose Orange peel (Gran Marnier?) and coriander. Heather blossoms rose water peach sherbet. Deeply honeyed floral and rich. White fruits even a touch of white port. Perhaps a touch of peat in a pithy green herbal note. A dash of water brings out a little green apple and mown grass and heightens the very small amount of peat (in a mossy/earthy way not smokey).Palate Viscous and honeyed. Full bodied if not creamy. Sweet baked goods (sugar cookies) raw local honey red raspberries. Later there is some jammy red fruits like pie filling. Very smooth with nary a tongue burn. Water does this a dis-service thinning the body with only a few drops and stinging the tongue with alcohol.Finish A touch of oak drying in the back of the throat. Medium-long but with nice floral passes and a lot more of that raw herby honey.Overall A satisfying dessert dram. Honeyed and full-bodied it reminds me a lot of white port but with more bite. It’s hard to imagine anyone not loving Oban 14. Leave off the water on this one though."
327,"Oban (18 year) - Oban is a Highland malt well known for its gentle dry honey-and-fruit character. See my review of the 14-year standard bottling here. Diageo owners of the tiny distillery have just announced that they now have enough stock of the older 18 year which was previously only released as a limited-edition bottling to make Oban 18 a permanent part of the lineup. As explained by Diageo Senior Master of Whisky Steve Beal at last week’s K&L Whisky Tasting in Redwood City CA the Oban distillery is unable to expand its still-room due to the city which has grown up around it. Diageo must make do with the production capacity of only two stills 6 days a week. They set aside 300 barrels each year for the Distiller’s Edition (review here) and now 300 barrels a year for the new 18 year-old. K&L in Redwood City currently has this one for the incredible price of $99.Nose Light honey lemon peel candied orange peel some bright golden apple notes. Light bright and sweet aroma.Palate Smooth but quite dry. Crisp. Caramel apple orange blossom honey warm notes of hard apple cider. Very elegant. The dryness does not come off rough like a young blend but instead dries the mouth and tingles the palate.Finish All honey. Raw local organic honey. Long and warming.Overall This is easily as smooth and refined as the Macallan 18 but the dryness and gentle straightforward flavors make it unchallenging. If you have a penchant for easy-drinking whiskies and a spare $100 to spend (which is a steal) this one is calling out to you. If you’re curious about Oban’s style the 14 is an exemplar of West Highland malt. Try that first.
"
328,Oban (Distiller’s Edition) - A Note on my tasting choices I’ve been criticized for discussing expensive malts on this blog and here comes another one. I’d just like to describe my strategy for choosing what to review I sample anything that I can get my hands on whether it’s $20 or $200 and I post those tasting notes despite my goal of reviewing mostly sub-$50 drams. I generally only purchase full bottles that are under $50 with a few notable “special occasion” purchases. I like to keep two or three bottles of expensive Scotch several bottles of sub-$50 whisky and a rotating selection of at least four value drams generally blends 10 year-old single malts and bourbons or ryes.Oban is a Highland malt well known for its gentle dry honey-and-fruit character. See my review of the 14-year standard bottling here. Diageo owners of the tiny distillery must make do with the production capacity of only two stills 6 days a week. They set aside 300 barrels each year for the Distiller’s Edition and now 300 barrels a year for the new 18 year-old. The Distiller’s Edition is a yearly release of the usual 14-year Oban which is further matured for 6-18 months in a Montilla Fino sherry butt (which is always a first-fill cask – in other words has only held sherry before). I tasted some of the 2010 bottling which was distilled in 1995.Nose Light hint of red grape otherwise pure Oban floral heather deep golden honey apple cider. This also shows some nice almond or marzipan and is light and dry.Palate Dry. Elegant light sherry with a wave of deep black cherry sweet apple juice and the characteristic honey. A very nice blending of the Oban style with a delicate sherry fruit basket.Finish Black cherry again plus some light fading wood tannins and a bare hint of sweet smoke. Wow.Overall I actually prefer this dram over the 18-year although its price puts it out of consideration for a spot in my regular cabinet. The 14 year remains my go-to Scotch for a light honeyed Highlander even above many similarly-styled Speysiders. However if you’re familiar with Oban and want to see what a little high-quality sherry does to the mix you owe it to yourself to try this one out.
329,Oban Bay Reserve – Game of Thrones “The Night’s Watch” - I’ve always been a big fan of Oban. It’s one of the few distilleries that come to mind when I want something essentially “Highland” and with such a consistent house character that you know every bottle is going to contain that same predominant biscuity honey quality. Prices have crept up over the years as they have with everything with the word “whisky” on the label but I still think of Oban 14 as my go-to Highland malt.You may have read my review of the Game of Thrones edition of Mortlach which is worth revisiting if you’re currently asking yourself what this bottle has to do with “Game of Thrones”. As of this writing there are still bottles of Oban “Night’s Watch” as well as some of the other Game of Thrones bottles in circulation. I suggest waiting until they go on another wave of closeouts since Diageo still wants to see these bottles off their books. I wouldn’t pay the listed $60 to $70 for this bottle but I sure as Hell would (and did) pay $25. At that price I wish I’d bought three.As usual with Diageo there’s not much reliable information about what’s actually in the bottle. Oban uses lightly peated malt which always surprises me because I rarely detect smoke in the glass. Oban Bay Reserve is a NAS (no age statement) whisky so we know it’s at least 3 years old but more likely – and this is a total guess – between 9 and 12. It’s bottled at 43% ABV. Chill filtered and color-adjusted? Probably. Who knows.Nose Gentle fruit with clear notes of plum apricot kiwi and bubble gum. Aromatic with nondescript floral notes and just enough tartness to be bright and inviting. Beneath that clean honey and crisp sweet barley grains. Simple but perfect in execution.Palate Moderate body. Intensely honeyed with a short tongue burn. The honey is complete with beeswax (reminds me of Clynelish). Some of the fruits from the aroma are present along with a layer of very slightly bitter charcoal a mild vanilla oakiness and a floor of standard malty cereal.Finish Medium-short. Turns nutty quickly with blanched almonds and toasted walnuts. The fruit runs out right away and it ends dry but without much bitterness.With Water A few drops of water seem to wash away the aromatic high notes including the best fruit. The palate seems thinner. Skip the water here.Overall A very straightforward tasty dram that is exactly what you expect from a not-quite-fully-mature Oban. The finish is on the short side and feels incomplete but the aroma is fantastic and the palate keeps up. I would happily buy more of this at the current bargain basement price of $25 and would even be satisfied to have paid $40. Pity I didn’t get more when it was on sale. 
330,Old Bardstown Bourbon - So I picked up a bottle of the new labeled version of Old Bardstown because it was on my “to-do” list. It wasn’t until I got it home that I realized that not only is this a Willett product but it’s actually distilled at the new Willett distillery in Bardstown Kentucky. Sweet breath of fresh air a new whiskey on the market that isn’t sourced! Hallelujah!Bottles in recent memory of Old Bardstown were sourced whiskey (like another Willett product Johnny Drum) but now that Willett has liquid of legal age it has switched the label and the contents to reflect that. Old Bardstown is a classically styled bourbon with a mash bill of 72% corn 13% rye and 15% malted barley. The whiskey is aged in new charred oak barrels for 4 years and bottled at 45% ABV. I got my bottle for $20 which is about where you’d expect to find a young bourbon with some pedigree and craft sensibilities. (It’s not single-handedly financing a new upstart distillery so it’s not $50 a bottle.)The distillery’s new output also goes into a Bottled-in-Bond version which does not yet enjoy wide distribution.Nose Up front there is a lot of wood with hints of fresh pine lumber. Dry and a little grassy. A hint of menthol. This actually smells like a young craft rye whiskey. A rest in the glass adds some vanilla sweetness so it no longer smells dry. The rest gives better balance as well.Palate Medium bodied. A fair tongue burn followed by candied ginger and gingerbread dotted with beads of sappy resin that border on engine grease. A little sweeter than promised by the nose with cherry cordial developing late.Finish Medium-long. A nice balance of cherry and wood. No longer grassy but somewhat bitter. Fades with a little charcoal.With Water A few drops of water mute the nose tickle and amplify the wood. I don’t think this needs any water just a rest in the glass.Overall Simple but well-executed. My current house bourbon is Eagle Rare 10 but this could easily replace it if I felt that I was going through it too fast to keep paying 40 bucks a bottle. At $20 this would make a very budget-friendly house bourbon.I scored this a “Must Try” because I’m so damn happy that there is affordable own-distillery juice coming out of Willett. You may not be as impressed as I was but if you don’t have a solid house bourbon yet you should definitely take a look at this one. It doesn’t hurt that this bourbon is easily better than a number of $50 craft offerings I’ve sampled in the past.
331,Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon - In my ongoing quest to discover truth in the claim that there is still good value in bourbon I grabbed a bottle of this inexpensive Kentucky Straight Bourbon. At $16 a bottle I’m not expecting fireworks. At 100 proof (50% ABV) Old Fitzgerald has a decent heft and can stand up to cocktail ingredients. This bottle is labelled “DSP-KY-1” (which means it was distilled at the Heaven Hill/Bernheim distillery) and bottled at DSP-KY-31 (the original Heaven Hill facility at Bardstown Kentucky) where it was probably warehoused as well. Heaven Hill is a huge operation capable of filling 1000 barrels a DAY and owning the rights to produce 86 different bourbon labels all of which are made using only two mashbills (one with wheat as the flavor grain the other with rye). That means that Elijah Craig Evan Williams and Henry McKenna and many more are all basically the same rye-flavored straight bourbon whiskey just aged and proofed differently. Old Fitzgerald Larceny Parker’s Heritage 10 year and Rebel Yell are basically all the same wheat-flavored straight bourbon whiskey. Sorta takes away from the “Prohibition-Era” “Bottled in Bond” mystique doesn’t it?Nose Walnuts caramel-covered apples an unfortunate dose of “fake”-smelling corn syrup and a bit of wood varnish.Palate Hot on the tongue. Not over-oaked but some nicely-balanced cooked sugar notes with some baking spices (clove cinnamon) reminiscent of ginger snap cookies.Finish Medium-long a continuance of the palate flavors and mercifully without bitterness. A final ghost of roasted chestnuts.With Water Several drops of water opens a very nice cloud of vanilla and rounds off (and dulls) the palate. Take it or leave it but the synergy with water bodes well for its mixability. Is that a word?Overall While Old Fitz doesn’t bring anything exciting or original to the table it has a good amount of heft (100 proof) some reasonably well-balanced flavors an unobjectionable finish and is light enough to mix a cocktail without dominating it. I could wish the aroma had a little less of that “cheap bourbon” character but beggars (at $16 a bottle) can’t be choosers.After mixing a simple cocktail I have to say I’ve had more robustly-flavored drinks with other bourbons but not $16 ones.
332,Old Forester 1920 “Prohibition Style” Bourbon - Brown Forman’s Old Forester brand to avoid being left in the dust of the whisky hype train is releasing a series of special-edition bourbons in honor of the brand’s history of per-Prohibition distillation (effectively a brag about how long the brand has been around). For once a whisky’s website blurb is more succinct than I would be in explaining what this particular expression is so I’ll just quote itThis 115 proof expression is the third release in our Old Forester Whiskey Row series and celebrates the brand’s continued distillation during Prohibition. For 13 years the production transport and sale of alcohol was strictly prohibited. However Old Forester was granted a permit to continue distilling on Louisville’s Whiskey Row. The 115 proof expression represents a barrel sample that company president Owsley Brown I would have batched at the beginning of Prohibition.It’s a nice story and it may even be true. In case you missed it the “1920” refers to the year the Volstead Act (aka Prohibition) went into force in the United States. This excerpt from Wikipedia on the subject made me giggleProhibition came into force at midnight on January 17 1920 and the first documented infringement of the Volstead Act occurred in Chicago on January 17 at 1259 a.m.Like most “special-edition-with-a-story” cash-grabs that have hit the shelves lately in the spirits industry this one carries a hefty price tag ($60 at my local stores). That’s kind of a lot of money for bourbon without an age statement in my mind but it’s gotten good press so I thought I’d give Old Forester another try since I panned their basic bottom-shelfer.This bourbon uses a mashbill of 72% corn 18% rye and 10% malted barley (for enzymes) the same as other Old Forester bottlings and is by law at least 4 years of age. The 115 proof (57.5% ABV) is the distiller’s estimate of the probable bottling proof that would have been used during Prohibition for whisky intended for “medicinal purposes”. That higher ABV takes some sting out of the price… at least if nothing else I can use it to make decent cocktails right?Nose At 115 proof this whiskey fairly climbs up your nostrils and begins garroting your nasal receptors. (Yes I’ll be sprinkling Prohibition-era imagery into this review wherever possible. You have been warned!) A rest in the glass does cool its heels a bit. Deep chewy nougat and blonde fudge. Not overly woody but roundly sweet. Lousy with caramel and a nip of banana. Right full of flavor and ritzy to boot.Palate Medium bodied. A haymaker to the tongue this burns like a house on fire. When the smoke clears there’s a layer of toasted nuts a sense of cardboard and raw cornmeal. There’s something missing – not enough sweetness not enough balance… something.Finish Medium-short. Banana cream pie and salt-water taffy. Not bitter at all but without a dominating flavor. Fades quickly like a getaway car after a bank heist.With Water Several drops of water have little effect beyond making the tongue burn more tolerable which is not a bad idea at this proof.Overall Like other Old Foresters that I’ve tried this comes across as big well-crafted bourbon that is somehow missing one critical element that I can’t put my finger on. Like a dive without a canary or a trigger man without a heater… it almost rates. The aroma is the cat’s pajamas but the rest leaves you dangling. One expects a little more oomph at this proof in terms of flavor concentration and it’s not there. A bourbon for this much cabbage should hit on all eight get me?Well that was fun for me anyway. If nothing else this will make some SOLID Prohibition-era cocktails not that I relish putting $60 whiskey into a mixing glass.
333,Old Forester Bourbon - After very much enjoying the Evan Williams Single Barrel earlier this week I move now to a sample that has been sitting in the back of my cabinet for awhile. Here’s a bottom-shelf brand in a plastic 50ml miniature (often a bad sign) Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon. First bottled in 1873 it was the first bourbon ever to be bottled by the whiskey maker and sold in sealed bottles (most whiskey at the time was sold in barrels to retailers who would bottle it themselves sometimes after doctoring or diluting the product).I’ve also reviewed the 1920 Prohibition and 100 Proof editions.Nose Sharp young with elements of sweet corn black cherry and old oak. A splash of water does nothing to improve.Palate Mild burn which doesn’t really resolve. Continues to be sharp and young-tasting even when notes of bitter almond dried apricot and musty hay emerge. Luckily a splash of water dulls a lot of the burn letting some of the sweeter flavors come through. A sparse but nice assortment of dried fruits nuts and jams.Finish Short mostly wood tannin and barrel char maybe a few fading nutty flavors and a little cherry preserve.Not particularly brash but also not particularly complex or interesting. The oak comes through but without much vanilla to balance it. There aren’t any higher fruity notes either. Mostly a muddy indistinct “bourbon-ness”. This is a very inexpensive whiskey (BevMo has it for $13 a bottle) but there are several other value whiskeys with more flavor Wild Turkey 101 (review upcoming) for one. That said if you have some Old Forester to drink and want it neat a few splashes of water go a long way and vastly improve the available flavors on the palate. I don’t like ice on (even bad) whiskey but that might be an option too.
334,Old Forester Signature 100 Proof Bourbon - Ok I’m going to start out with a spoiler. It turns out that I just do not like Old Forester bourbon. I really didn’t like the Classic 43% bottling and I thought the 1920 Prohibition Style bottling overpriced and underwhelming. In both cases I felt the whiskey was missing something. So I thought maybe 100 proof (arguably the “Goldilocks Zone” for bourbon) is the answer to my quibbles?Old Forester’s Signature 100 Proof is indeed bottled at 50% ABV but notably is NOT bottled in bond. Like the rest of the Old Forester bourbon lineup it is Kentucky Straight Bourbon from Brown-Forman made from a mash bill of 72% corn 18% rye and 10% malted barley (for enzymes) and aged for an undisclosed amount of time in new charred American oak barrels. Originally released at around $30 it seems to have dropped a bit and can be found for the very-appropriate price of $20.Nose Alive and assertive with classic bourbon aromas of dry oak brown sugar and molasses cherry juice and anise (black licorice). The anise is actually a little more complex something like root beer or sassafras. There is also a layer of vaguely-sweet corn (cornmeal) and a strong nose tickle.Palate Thin body but a robust oaky wave of tongue burn and tastes hotter than 50% ABV. The oak is heavy but in good balance with the corn-based sweetness. Some bitter charcoal invades the back half of the palate boding ill…Finish Medium-to-long. Dry with more of that bitter charcoal right away and little sweetness to balance it. Eventually the bitterness turns vegetal like cocktail bitters before fading.With Water A few drops of water open up a nice additional fruit aroma like cherry candy (Jolly Ranchers) and makes the palate initially sweeter and tames some of the tongue burn. It even allows that cherry note to echo on the finish. I highly recommend a little water with this.Overall It starts strong with classic bourbon flavors in appropriate balance but then quickly devolves into an overly-hot overly-dry bitter mess. After the first sip the palate is somewhat ruined by all the bitterness and the experience becomes monotonous. Water improves it a bit (indeed water is essential) but can’t single-handedly save this whiskey. Most of this is irrelevant in a well-mixed cocktail but neat I cannot recommend it even at this price. If you find it for $20 you can dump it in cocktails without remorse. Much above that and I would look elsewhere.
335,Old Grand-Dad 114 Bourbon - Owned and distilled by the Jim Beam company Old Grand-Dad is named after famed distiller Basil Hayden. The whisky is produced at a few different proofs including a 100-proof Bottled in Bond variant and a 40% ABV bottom-shelfer. Having enjoyed the 40% ABV version despite its anemic wateriness I thought I might enjoy the full-strength version. Old Grand-Dad 114 is named appropriately for its 114 proof (57% ABV). This is not quite cask-strength as they must water the whiskey down to hit a consistent 57% ABV but it’s close.Old Grand-Dad bourbons are purportedly from a “high rye” mash bill despite a total lack of definitive information on the subject.Oddly I found that Old Grand-Dad (both 40% and 57%) to be distinctly different from their namesake bourbon (created by Jim Beam in 1992 to honor the legendary distiller) Basil Hayden which is… I’m sorry… bad.Nose Alcohol burn (of course) tobacco scorched toasted nuts (acrid). Heavily oaky. Caramel and burned sugar. Closed-off (hard to detect anything but alcohol).Palate Medium bodied. Intense tongue burn (as expected) followed by signature Jim Beam corn-forward mash. There are also elements of cherry pie filling caramel powdered cinnamon and dark chocolate-covered cherries. This otherwise pleasant-sounding combination is marred by overbearing charcoal and astringent cardboard-like oakiness.Finish Medium-short. Corn (think Corn Nuts) charcoal (but oddly without the usual charcoal bitterness) cinnamon and more tobacco. Fades without changing much.With Water Several drops of water (yes please!) have little obvious effect on the aroma. The palate however is far easier to handle and contains sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla. If you’re tasting this I suggest smelling it adding a very little water tasting it and then adjusting with more water to your preference.Overall This is very basic corn-forward Jim Beam-esque full-strength whiskey. This is the kind of thing you use when you want a cocktail or recipe to taste like “bourbon” but without caring much about the nuance. The kind of thing you order so that you can shoot it and feel like a frontiersman at a dingy saloon in Deadwood. The kind of thing you use in a cocktail when it’s been “that kind of day” and the only thing you care about in your Old Fashioned is the alcohol percentage. (For what it’s worth it makes a perfectly passable Old Fashioned with a robust bourbon flavor and appropriate strength.) At $26 it’s good for all of those things and those things only.
336,Old Grand-Dad Bourbon (40% ABV) - Owned and distilled by the Jim Beam company Old Grand-Dad is named after famed distiller Basil Hayden. The whisky is produced at a few different proofs including a 100-proof Bottled in Bond variant. I tasted a plastic 50ml miniature containing 40% ABV whiskey which would normally be an inauspicious start. Luckily I was quite impressed with the 40% (although below I note the wateriness) and am looking forward to trying the 50%. This is according to the website a “high rye” mashbill although no other information is available. Shocker.Some perusing on the ‘net has revealed that this 40% ABV version is a cut from the previous 43% bottling strength a move that went largely unnoticed by the whisky drinking public. This is as opposed to the recent Maker’s Mark debacle which was such a PR nightmare that Maker’s rescinded the change. I would say that this one is distinctly watery and thus the slightly higher price tag on the 100-proof bottled-in-bond product is a worthwhile investment. (See my review of the 114-proof bottling here.)Nose Light corn syrup candied apple maraschino cherries substantial nose tickle. Lively and bright aroma not unpleasant. Maybe a hint of clove or cinnamon.Palate A bit watery. On the rough side with a lot of young unripe alcohol. Resolves into pine sap cherry pie filling and fresh corn. Light and not overly wooded.Finish A hint of wood an echo of the fruits from the aroma and a suggestion of marshmallow and soft caramels. Not bitter not bad.With Water Water increases the suggestion of baking spices on the nose brings out too much raw alcohol on the palate and makes the finish ragged. I’d skip the water.Overall It’s not the most amazing bourbon in the world but it’s light refreshing young and vibrant. There are some interesting flavors and aromas and except for its watery texture and low proof it’s probably quite decent in a cocktail and not altogether objectionable straight up. I think it’s interesting that despite being young being filled into a plastic bottle and sitting in my cabinet for six months to a year this whiskey has not suffered in the slightest. I’m willing to take that as evidence that bad 50ml experiences (of which I’ve had quite a few) come from bad batches not bad bottles. C’mon whisky industry wake up and realize that people use these things to sample your products not just to dump together a manhattan on an airplane! Also good on you Old Grand-Dad. This is a respectable pour of cheap bourbon and it makes me very interested in trying the higher-proof versions. If you’re looking for inexpensive bourbon this is a good place to start although I’d seek out the 100-proof Bottled In Bond (50% ABV) one.
337,Old Malt Cask: Talisker (6 year) 2009-2016 - This is not a review that is intended to inform a purchase. I bought a bottle of this K&L Wines and Spirits -exclusive Talisker from Old Malt Cask awhile back and only just recently dug it out of my cabinet to try. It’s long sold-out. I am reviewing this instead as a look at what you might expect from independent bottlings of very young peated malts which seem to be appearing more and more on shelves as the older stuff disappears from warehouses.Talisker 10 is one of my favorite drams of all time and maybe #2 or #3 on my list of favorite peated malts. I’ve been (thus far) slightly less-than-impressed by any of the NAS expressions released by Diageo to capitalize on the popularity of the distillery which is just fine with me because Talisker 10 can still be had for $50 a bottle. This Old Malt Cask bottling spoke to me younger Talisker (with an age statement!) purportedly aged in sherry bottled at a potent 100 proof and only $40. The malt was just one month shy of 7 years of age and bottled in 2016 without added coloring or chill filtration. Only 361 bottles were filled out of this single sherry hogshead.Nose Fishy peat with a heap of black peppercorn thin malty grain and chalky minerals. Seaspray and absolutely no sherry whatsoever. Complex young and fiery.Palate Thin body. Aggressive tongue burn which clears slowly to reveal some vanilla sweetness sea-salt caramels and a drifting hazy fugue of peat – like being in a cold-smoker cabinet after the fire has gone out.Finish Long. More of that salty caramel now with a seaweed chaser (yum!). More black pepper and now some tobacco. Fades very slowly to a dry cigarette-like smoke which is somewhat acrid.With Water A few drops of water release a lemon peel (verging on Lemon Pledge) note which conflicts oddly with the fish (ok ok “brine”) notes. It does however tame the fieriness a bit. I can see wanting a little water for that reason.Overall Man this is really not good. But at $40 I also really can’t complain. This confirms two suspicions that I’ve had One that ultra-young peated malts contain more peat flavor than their standard 10- and 12-year elder siblings. Two that there’s a reason peated malts are usually released at 10 or 12 years of age. The smoke and peat and brine need some time to integrate to mellow and to lose that brash acrid aspect. Unfortunately this may as well have been aged in cardboard for all the total and complete lack of sherry character. The label might as well have just said “aged in a barrel”.It IS fascinating to see not-ready-for-prime-time Talisker though and I’m happy to only have paid $40 for a ticket. I can’t ever imagine being in the mood for a glass of this unless maybe when I’m mad at myself for something. They could put that on the bottle.Seriously though I can’t recommend anyone buy this even if it were still available. I do think it would be possible to develop a taste for “rough” and cheap peated malt… although you’re really only saving $10 to $20 per bottle and getting a lot less quality. Bottles like this are in the same vein as Finlaggan Old Reserve and other bottom-shelf peated malts except that the transparency of the indie bottling is refreshing. Nobody is trying to pass this off as anything but what it is.
338,Old Overholt Rye - Rye whiskey has enjoyed an amazing renaissance over the last decade (or less) owing largely to the parallel rise in popularity of pre-prohibition cocktails. Straight rye is similar to bourbon in that it is made from a mash of grains usually distilled on a continuous column still and aged in new charred American oak barrels. In fact a legal straight rye whiskey might be 51% rye grain and 49% corn while a legal straight bourbon whiskey might be 49% rye grain and 51% corn! (Although nobody does this to my knowledge.) Straight rye is also usually mashed with a small amount of malted barley (around 5%) which is useful for its naturally-occurring enzymes. These help to break down the troublesome rye grain and help release its sugars. By all accounts rye by itself is a very tricky grain to distill because of its tendency to turn into a sticky tar-like mess in the mash tun and still. This may be why 100% rye whiskies are uncommon although they do exist.Old Overholt has become a staple in the wells of bars around the US and is often what you’ll get if you ask for a Rye Manhattan or a Rye Old Fashioned. Produced by Jim Beam at the Clermont distillery in Kentucky the brand dates back to the early 1800s and was originally made in the Monongahela (Pennsylvania) style meaning it was 100% or almost 100% rye distilled in a copper pot still and was sweeter and/or rougher than modern rye (reports vary). Nowadays Old Overholt is 51% rye just barely meeting the legal definition with the remainder made up of corn and a little malted barley for enzymes. It’s aged for three years (fours years in the recent past the switch occurred around 2013) and bottled at 40% ABV.Nose Burning rubber tires. Clove cardamom stale spices. Shoe leather. Vinyl polish (“new car smell”). Marzipan.Palate Medium body. Mildly sweet. Cinnamon rolls tanned leather old hay.Finish Very short. Rye malt beer a hint of cinnamon “red hots” candies. Fades quickly with nothing – not even bitterness.With Water A few drops of water adds some star anise and a mild tartness – like cider vinegar – to the aroma. It also brings out a fresh apple note on the palate and lengthens the finish adding some nuttiness. I highly recommend adding some water if you’re stuck with a glass of this.Overall Obviously this was intended for mixing and not sipping straight. Nevertheless if I dislike a whisky straight up then I’m not likely to want to make cocktails with it especially when there are better choices (like Rittenhouse 101 Knob Creek Rye (also from Jim Beam) or even Wild Turkey Rye) which are superior for both purposes. While it makes unoffensive cocktails which could be seen as a plus (especially for a well bottle at a lot of bars) it also makes uninteresting cocktails. Adding water definitely perks up this rye and gives it a few redeeming qualities but overall this is not a bottle I would invest in (or recommend) again.
339,Old Pulteney (12 year) - What can I say about Old Pulteney that I didn’t say in my review of the 17 year? I promise not to talk about Jim Murray… oops.Old Pulteney 12 year is aged only in ex-bourbon casks and can be found (with a little hunting) for $32 a bottle although recent fame caused by the attentions of the aforementioned author have driven up prices of the entire OP range (even the NAS Navigator). You may have to pay $42.Nose Everyone always says ‘salty’ when talking about OP. To me it smells more like a heavily vegetal tequila. Seaweed cooked cactus (nopales) lime peel and a hint of vanilla. All of the aromas are robust – nothing light about this whisky.Palate Salted caramel roasted chestnuts a sticky industrial grime (a little like the ‘dirty’ flavor of Springbank) like grimy pennies.Finish Some sweetness arrives dry taffy shortbread cookies. The finish gets grassy again but without any bitterness. Ends on the woody side.With Water Water adds a tart note a more distinct lime peel or even key lime pie to the nose and makes the finish slightly sweeter. Some water can’t hurt.Overall Somewhat of a rollercoaster of unique flavors and aromas paired with off-putting and off-seeming notes like grimy pennies. It’s a bit like a woodsier grassier more tequila-like variant of Springbank. Very little sweetness this is almost more of an aperitif or digestif than a dessert drink although missing the bitter herbs. I would seek out a taste of this before committing to a bottle even if you’re a Springbank fan. It’s just not for everybody.
340,Old Pulteney (17 year) - What does briny mean in a tasting note? How do you smell brine? It’s not just the salt… salt alone has no smell. Try pouring a cup of salt into two cups of hot water let it dissolve and smell. Nothing. Brine in a tasting note must refer more specifically to the essence of the ocean – or more exactly – the shore. Seaweed algae and the many minerals and microflora present in oceanwater contribute to the unmistakable scent and taste of the sea. It may also be more accurate that ‘brine’ smells like ocean air not ocean water. For me – a childhood memory perhaps – the scent is inextricable from the flavor of fresh soft saltwater taffy.The debate has been raging (hyperbole if ever there was) for decades about whether coastal whiskies such as Talisker and Old Pulteney truly smell or taste like the sea air in which they mature. The arguments largely un-provable are based on the probable fact that air laden with oceanic compounds enters and interacts with the whisky as the casks “breathe” during their maturation. Thus whisky aged in the presence of sea air (especially turbulent seas and where the wind is extreme) will absorb some of that briny character while casks aged inland will not. This would be arguably the closest whisky gets to wine’s terroir – the influence of the land on the final product. Detractors argue that the effect if it happens at all is minuscule and the briny notes are solely the products of suggestion.I think Old Pulteney has characteristics of brine so I guess I’m on the side of the terroir-ists (see what I did there?). I also noticed some tart cherries which might be attributable to the 10% oloroso sherry aging. The rest of the malt is aged in ex-bourbon. The 17-year is not chill-filtered and is bottled at 46% ABV.These days you can’t talk about Old Pulteney without discussing whisky writer and author of Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible Jim Murray who in 2012 awarded Old Pulteney 21-year with his “2012 Best Whisky in the World” title. This caused a flurry of sales for the previously sedate line of products and a flurry of Internet commentary about whether Jim Murray is just stirring up trouble. I don’t have any of the 21 but let’s proceed on the assumption that the 17 is similar enough.Nose Yup. Brine. A definite whiff of freshly-trodden seaweed on a windswept shoreline… yes whisky always makes me wax poetic. Seawater and something citrus lemon saltwater taffy. Tangy peat – like Highland Park‘s. Tart cherries. The buttery salted caramel and marshmallow malt character is somewhat buried beneath the tartness but it’s there. Very nicely crafted – statuesque and gruff but potent and flavorful.Palate Soft. Lively tongue burn. Some light barrel char and malty caramelized grains. The tip of my tongue picks up some of those tart lemon/cherry notes. The rest tastes like somewhat standard bourbon-aged single malt.Finish Medium long. Principally sweet – caramel again. Driftwood fire smoke. Vanilla saltwater taffy now. Fades with smoked lemon peels. Many writers call it ‘dry’ but I don’t get that.With Water Water makes the nose a little too sharp – although it awakens some mild fruitwood smoke notes. The water does a nice job of taming the tongue burn and spreads out those lemon – now lemon custard – notes across the whole palate. Try without the water first and then see if it does anything interesting for you.Overall Unless those additional four years cause magic to happen I don’t agree with Jim Murray. It is a tasty straightforward malt with an excellent tart/briny nose and some interesting smoky notes on the finish. It can’t compete with Islay for peatiness nor with Highland Park for value (especially after the prices shot up with the Whisky Bible award). If you’re a fan of the briny/tart character and can’t get enough of Highland Park and Clynelish then this is probably a must-have for your shelf. If not maybe it’s worth buying a special-occasion bottle to try for yourself to understand what Jim Murray thinks is so wonderful about the distillery.
341,Old Pulteney Navigator - Sheltering in place has put me in a funk that makes me more likely to knock back cocktails than appreciate good whisky. Really this week’s review is appropriate for that. My first thought after tasting Old Pulteney Navigator was “This is a dram for someone who’s looking to punish themselves.” Now that sounds overly judgy so maybe let’s rephrase that as “a dram for someone who’s had a hard day. Or week. Or 75 days in a row.” I’ve said before that Old Pulteney is not for everybody. It’s not quite as much of an “acquired taste” as highly-peated Islay scotches like Laphroaig but it’s also so full of odd salty grimy flavors that it’s hard to put it in the same category as a pristine Glenmorangie or Balvenie.Navigator has some (I’m not in a charitable mood) marketing drivel about yacht races or some such. It’s really an NAS (no age stated) vatting of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. At least the whisky is bottled at a perfect 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring (aka “craft presentation”). OK I hear you saying it’s a craft NAS single malt so I can expect to pay a little less than the age-stated entry level bottling right? Nope. Wrong. Voted off the island. This is around $10-$15 more than the 12-year. Bah I say. Bah.Nose Industrial oils and solvents with briny meaty peat and tarry molasses. Not even a little sweet. Of course I say that and then a rest in the glass adds some brown sugar.Palate Medium body. A robust tongue burn (more than expected for 46%) is followed by sludgy seaweed muddy peat (without the smoke) and engine grease. At last there is a very slight sweetness in the form of dark treacle or molasses and some slight fig notes that only appear after a rest in the glass. (Ah! There’s the sherry. I guess.)Finish Long. The molasses appears first finally showing some brown sugar instead of just vegetal tar. Some mouth-drying oaky tannins that are surprisingly not bitter. The whole thing lingers intact for quite awhile.With Water A few drops of water add a little nose tickle and round out the small amount of sweetness in the aroma. The body is thinner but the palate flavors are more likable and even has a new tart lime note that pairs well with the rum-y flavors. I definitely suggest trying this without and then with some water.Overall It’s certainly maritime in that it smells like something slathered on a hull to make it seaworthy. I kid. Sort of. There is an intrusion of peat but absolutely no smoke which makes it smell and taste earthy but without evoking Islay’s style of smoky peat. The overall effect is brooding and difficult and that so-called partial sherry cask aging is thoroughly in the background. I’m not sure I could enjoy this regularly although I appreciate the complexity and the stubborn rum-like lack of affability.In my own personal notes I graded it the same as Old Pulteney 12 which is cheaper and has an age statement. That’s all you need to know I think.
342,Old Soul Blended Straight Bourbon - “Generous Reader” strikes again! Today’s review is courtesy of long-time and long-suffering reader formally referred to as “Generous Reader” but this time it’s not a Talisker or Caol Ila. It’s a bit of an oddball and not something I’ve ever seen on my local shelves out here in California. This is a blend of straight bourbons produced by Cathead Distillery in Jackson Mississippi. Cathead is the first legal distillery in MS since Prohibition and they produce vodka gin and bourbon.So what’s a “Blended Straight Bourbon” you ask? I’m not sure about the legal definition of the term but Cathead has taken three straight bourbons and blended them together so the term is apropos. The first two (totaling 90% of the blend) are 4 year-old MGP sourced bourbons and the third (at 10% of the blend) is Cathead’s own 2-year-and-1-month-old Mississippi bourbon. It’s not specified on the website but I’m guessing there’s not much of the own-distilled juice to go around so they decided to stretch it with readily-available MGP liquid. Time will tell if the distillery updates its blend or its lineup when it has more of its own aged bourbon to pull from. The website lists the mash bill at 21% rye 75% corn and 4% malted barley but it’s not clear whether all three bourbons share the same mash bill or if that’s some kind of average.The final blended straight bourbon is bottled at a respectable 45% ABV and retails squarely in the “craft” range between $40 and $50. For the stats those are “I believe in this enterprise and I want to support it” prices. Which as much as I tend to knock it is a strategy that can mean the difference between a working local distillery and a defunct boarded-up former distillery. Vote with your dollars as they say.Nose Heavy nose tickle but a good amount of caramel and nutty oak. The combination reminds me of pecan pie. It’s sweet on the nose but not overly so.Palate Medium body. Strong but brief tongue burn. More of the same notes from the aroma but there’s also more spice here – cinnamon nutmeg allspice a bit of barrel char and a little bit of pine sap.Finish Medium length. A nice round tart cherry note takes over and meshes nicely with the spices which proceed through the finish. Finishes without evolving.With Water A few drops of water bring out a lot of the spices that were hiding and adds a vanilla bean note. The water doesn’t seem to affect the palate but makes the finish a bit sweeter. Definitely try this with a little water.Overall As I’ve taken to saying quite often lately MGP makes some damn fine whiskey. Cathead’s blend turns the MGP components into a very tasty bourbon with a lot of classic bourbon elements that are tied together nicely. The youth is detectable via a little pine note and a little extra vegetal bitterness at the tail end of the finish but those are minor issues. Obviously I’d prefer a higher percentage of Cathead’s own whiskey in the blend and I’ll be interested to see what a bottle of 100% Cathead whisky tastes like if they ever bottle one. If you have a tie to Mississippi or are in the area and see this on a shelf and want to support a local business it’s probably worth a taste. Worst case it’ll make perfectly acceptable bourbon cocktails.
343,Old Tub Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon - I have not historically been much of a fan of Jim Beam. Something about the house character jars my sensibilities and I seem to detect it in every inexpensive release they do. Older Beam (Knob Creek Baker’s Booker’s etc.) doesn’t seem to have that problem.It was thus that I took David Driscoll’s effusive shilling of Beam’s new limited “Old Tub” release with a grain of salt. I mean he’s not always right. (Spoiler He is always right.) Still $19 wasn’t too much to throw away on a bottle of bourbon I figured and it could always become cocktails.Old Tub is what Jim Beam used to be called a century ago when it was first sold in bottled form. The name changed to “Jim Beam” in 1943 and the previous brand name was relegated to a Kentucky-only low-volume brand. Now in 2020 Beam has released a limited edition renewal of the Old Tub brand. It’s still bottled-in-bond and in an effort to lend the release some authenticity the whiskey is not chill-filtered and also not charcoal filtered. Honestly I don’t know why in 2020 any whisky company still filters its whisky but kudos to Beam for recognizing that maybe keeping some flavor in their young whiskey might be a good idea. Before you ask the liquid is screened to prevent chunks of oak and charcoal from ending up in the bottle.The whiskey is a Kentucky straight bourbon and is 4 to 5 years old. So 4 years old. Due to the Bonded requirements it is bottled at 50% ABV and was distilled in a single distilling season and aged in a government-bonded warehouse. The bourbon is “limited” but you can bet your breeches if it takes off Beam will make more.Nose Cork. Chewy chocolate nougat. Caramel popcorn. Circus peanuts (banana-flavored candy). Peanut butter. It smells – God help me – like a turn-of-the-century saloon with peanut shells on the floor.Palate Robust heavy body almost chewy. Tongue burn is as-expected for 100 proof. Most of the aroma compounds continue onto the palate. It actually tastes like it smells. There’s also some cherry and cinnamon and a bit of charcoal.Finish On the short side. A little menthol picks up on the finish and it fades without much change but also without any bitterness.With Water A few drops of water don’t seem to change things much aside from maybe adding a touch of corn-syrup sweetness to the aroma and palate. I actually prefer it without the water but it’s cheap enough to experiment with. See what ice does too – see if you can detect the visual “unfiltered” difference when it becomes chilled.Overall Something unique in bourbon? What?! Seriously I expected this to be reconstituted Jim Beam with a soupçon of marketing but no! I don’t know if it’s the lack of filtration or the barrel selection or what but this is not only downright tasty bourbon it’s also got an honest-to-God antique character. Tasting this I actually feel like someone from 1920 knocking back a glass in a saloon after a hard day on the trail or whatever. This gives me the same sense of history that some older single malt scotches do when they smell like barnyard/hay.This is also cheap enough that I can call it a “Must Have” without any regret. If you like bourbon you’ll like this even if Jim Beam isn’t your cup of tea. Also I don’t know if this is really a limited release or not but you can probably assume that even if it becomes popular and Beam adds it to the regular lineup they’ll have to cut some corners. Future batches will probably not be quite this good so buy some now if you’re interested.
344,OOLA Waitsburg Bourbon - Let’s cut to the chase Up until today every craft whisky I’ve tried that’s come out of Washington state has been excellent. So upon seeing a bottle of OOLA’s Waitsburg Bourbon available in my Flaviar subscription I figure what’s the worst that can happen?On paper everything seems to check out. This is 5 year-old bourbon which was previously sourced and blended but is now all made with a four-grain mashbill distillate from OOLA’s own small distillery in Seattle. They’re using locally-grown Washington State soft white winter wheat and organic corn from Waitsburg WA along with locally-sourced barley and rye. The mashbill which probably changes based on grain availability is around 65% corn 25% rye 13% malted barley and 12% white winter wheat. The whiskey is aged for a short time in small 10-gallon barrels to kickstart maturation and then is moved into standard 53-gallon barrels. The final bourbon is bottled at a respectable 47% ABV. Before you ask OOLA is the name of the owner’s dog.Despite some thorough digging I’m unable to determine what batch number represented the switch from blended sourced bourbon to 100% in-house spirit. My bottle is from Batch 86 for what that’s worth and the bottle label mentions the act of “sourcing the finest aged bourbon available” so I’m guessing I have one of the prior blended versions. It’s also worth noting that reviews online seem to vary with a lot of respectable reviewers giving this bourbon high marks. This could be due to batch variation (which is a much bigger deal with small-batch craft spirits) or it could be due to the switch away from blending sourced bourbon. Impossible to tell.There is also a cask-strength edition available and OOLA also produces gins vodkas and other craft spirits.Nose Vodka-esque acetone notes greet (assault?) the nose first followed immediately by an almost-cloying refined sweetness like powdered sugar or unflavored rock candy. The vodka is accompanied by some nice (by vodka standards) notes of fruit-and-flowers variety (juniper berries kiwi orange blossom). And now that I’ve noticed the juniper I can’t get the scent-memory of gin out of my head.Palate Medium-bodied. Woody up front with a lot of pine sap and wet sawdust. Not too hot even for 47% ABV. The sweet notes are prevalent here as well with abundant caramel/butterscotch and a nice light cereal flavor. Alas what would be a nice light bourbon flavor is marred by more of that acetone / paint thinner.Finish On the short side. Rock candy again a touch of pine and a bit of barrel charcoal that isn’t quite bitter. A bit thin and over quickly.With Water Water of course amps up the vodka notes. It does add a pleasant silkiness to the body but I’d still say skip the water.Overall A thoroughly disappointing experience. One has been conditioned these days to think of craft whiskey as the purview of the quality-obsessed the flavor-conscious the skilled craftsmen who can do it better than the big boys because they aren’t shackled by the lowest-common denominator or hampered by a board of directors. This is however distinctly worse than most bottom-shelf bourbons in every way I can think of. I’ve only tasted that acetone/paint thinner note in the cheapest spirits (usually those blended with straight grain whiskey) and this has no backbone of oak nor raft of flavors or aromas to offset the overpowering suggestion of vodka.I’m sad I wanted to like this more. I hope it’s a fluke or a bad batch. I hope this is not representative of the newer 100% own-distillate bottlings that are on the market now. Despite that hope consider the effects of Anchoring – the name of this distillery will forever be anchored in my mind to this first bad experience.
345,Paddy Irish Whiskey - Paddy which claims to be the best-selling whiskey in Ireland has only recently received wider distribution to the rest of the world in an effort to compete with giants Jameson and Powers also made at the Midleton distillery. Formerly a Pernod-Ricard brand Paddy was sold to Sazerac (makers of Buffalo Trace Bourbon and Pappy) in 2016. The whiskey itself a “high-malt” blend of all three styles of Irish whiskey (malt whiskey single pot still and column grain whiskey) is triple-distilled aged between 4 and 7 years and bottled at 40% ABV.Nose Heady grain-forward whiskey with a lot of hay-flecked oiliness and a grimy/sooty nearly-peat-like earthy quality. Slight vanilla sweetness deep in the glass but main impression is dry.Palate Syrupy body. Again grain-forward with a bit more tongue burn than I expected at 40% ABV. Sweet with a lot of cereals honey and a hint of cocoa nibs.Finish On the short side. Here the acetone / paint-thinner notes finally show. Mild nuttiness and a bit of bitter charcoal.With Water A few drops of water amp up the weird industrial notes and add some acidity (white vinegar) to the aroma. The water thins the palate somewhat and adds vague sweetness to the finish. Water not necessary but it doesn’t hurt anything.Overall Not. Bad. The impression is heavy on the grain and there is a weird sooty oiliness that could be off-putting but it is well-balanced by sweetness on the tongue and a delay of the inevitable “young grain” acetone to the finish. It lacks the heavy caramel notes of Powers and the tropical fruits of Jameson but makes up for those deficiencies with complexity (earthiness) and fewer vodka-esque “cheap grain” notes. Faced with the decision of these three blends in a bar I would likely choose Paddy neat over the others. A newbie might be better off with Jameson due to the weird sooty notes here. Still they all get the job done and don’t stand up to any of the better Irish pot still whiskeys (Redbreast 12) or malts (Tyrconnell).
346,Pappy Van Winkle’s Family Reserve Bourbon (15 year) - I was in Beltramo’s Wines and Spirits the other day perusing the Scotch when I overheard a fellow customer asking an employee whether they had any Pappy Van Winkle’s Bourbon. I could tell the Beltramo’s rep was stifling a laugh. “There’s a waiting list” he said. “How long? Very long.”This is a pretty common story. Pappy Van Winkle tends to do releases by allotment once a year generally in the Fall. Stores that have placed orders get an unpredictable number of bottles – or none at all – and these all go to the waiting list participants some of whom may have been waiting for years to get their hands on some Pappy’s. Even sadder according to Bourbon Dork there’s speculation that the era of Pappy’s is coming to an end with stock of the original wheated bourbon (Stitzel-Weller which closed in 1992) running dry this year with the 15-year-old and in 5 more years the 20 will be gone as well. By “gone” I mean it will be made with Buffalo Trace spirit but sold under the same label. Only time will tell if the level of quality will remain as high or if this gem will be truly gone forever.The whiskey mashbill contains wheat instead of rye although some rye-like spice notes emerge. It was aged for 15 years in “deeply charred” mountain oak barrels in Kentucky.I don’t normally mention appearance but this bourbon has a truly beautiful red-gold color.Thanks SO much to Tim who kindly sent me some samples of precious bourbon. Here are my notes on the 15-yearNose Caramel corn treacle and cinnamon taffy. The wheat component is very reminiscent of rye – hints of nutmeg and clove. There is an unctuous depth to the nose – dark wood grilled sweet corn on the cob and whole roasted pecans. A little vanilla bean ice cream or crème anglaise on top. Big and potent.Palate Big wood influence lacquer nutty and dark with a little cherrywood. Dry cigars hickory smoke blackened corn. Medium bodied.Finish Oh so smooth. The cherrywood and varnish notes stick around and the oak tannins take up near permanent residence in the back of the throat.Don’t bother adding any water to this one… It doesn’t need it.Overall Everything you expect in a bourbon with a healthy spice profile but amplified. It makes other bourbons taste watered-down in comparison. The wood integration is masterful – you’d expect 15 Kentucky summers to reduce this to a glass of liquid wood extract but instead it just makes everything taste… Bigger. Excellent.I marked this “must try” but I suggest trying a few cheaper bourbons first and if you like them you’ll love this so seek out a glass or a bottle (if you can) and be quick about it in case next year’s allotment isn’t as good!
347,Pappy Van Winkle’s Family Reserve Bourbon (20 year) - It is Christmas and I am celebrating the season by opening a 1oz sample that I have been saving for – literally – 5 years. Shortly after I started this blog a very (VERY) kind reader sent me a pair of Pappy samples. The first Pappy 15 year opened my eyes to the wonders of Stitzel-Weller bourbon and I squirreled away the ounce of 20-year for a special occasion. As the secondary market for rare bottles blossomed and Pappy 20 became worth north of $1000 no occasion seemed “special” enough. That’s the issue with “special occasion” bottles of all kinds – sometimes you just gotta let a Tuesday be special or you’ll end up with a giant pile of unopenable treasures.If you don’t know what Pappy is by now go ahead and do some quick Googling. For the lazy and uninformed it’s old wheated bourbon from a now-closed distillery that is flat-out impossible to get due to a buying frenzy and very limited allocated releases. Even newer bourbon made at the Buffalo Trace distillery to reproduce the old recipe is snapped up immediately upon release and garners long waiting lists and crazy auction prices. Some bars carry bottles of Pappy and charge ridiculous prices for a glass which is nevertheless the only way most people will ever taste it. There are 10 12 15 20 and 23 year releases and a 13-year straight rye. The whisky I’m reviewing came from a bottle released before the Buffalo Trace juice reached 20 years of age which guarantees it was made at Stitzel-Weller.The 20-year is bottled at 45.2% ABV (contrast with the 15-year at 53.5%). Most of the dismissive “too cool for Pappy” commentary on the ‘net would have you believe that the 20- and 23-year are overly oaky and that the 15-year is best. Let’s see…Nose Dripping caramel dense vanilla honey candy and bright fresh orange peel. Intensely oaky but not dry or astringent. Potent and concentrated and a little more nose tickle than expected from 45% ABV. After a rest in the glass the grain notes come forward and smell like moist baked goods (blondies).Palate Silky syrupy body. Potent hazelnut butter note upfront with minimal tongue burn. Soft with flecks of charcoal and sweet dense oak but without any bitterness. High notes of orange peel and cherry liqueur.Finish Medium-long. Still sweet but drying out with mild tannins. A wave of menthol. Lingers finishing slowly without any bitterness. Classic.With Water A few drops of water amp up the nose tickle without adding anything new. The palate is a little more tart but otherwise unchanged. There is no need to add water to this. Enjoy it as is.Overall Pappy hysteria aside this stuff is really tasty. Flawless potent concentrated flavor and without the eye-watering proof of the younger expressions. Surprisingly not overly-oaked (like the Internet claims) but also not really markedly different than the 15 year. In fact I would probably be unable to say which was older if tasted side-by-side if it weren’t for the difference in proof. It does strike me as somewhat sweeter than I expected but in a good non-cloying way. Truly rewarding in the glass. Too bad about the ridiculous waiting lists and secondary market prices.I won’t insult you by calling this a “Must Try” because good luck but I will say that if you are someday lucky enough to be confronted with the choice of buying a bottle of the 15 or a bottle of the 20 know that the 20 is not noticeably better in this blogger’s opinion but it’s also not worse or overly-oaked. Both are also not worth (again in my opinion) much more than retail. I’d probably be happy to hand over $150 for a bottle or either but not much more.Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
348,Peach Street Distillers Bourbon - American craft whiskies – particularly bourbons – have been cropping up everywhere in the last five years. It seems like every week I read about a previously-unknown distillery in some little town that has won an award or launched a national release of its whiskey. Luckily for these craft producers most American whiskey can be ready to bottle in as little as a year or two. This is in contrast to scotch which takes approximately ten years in barrel to mature enough for release. Of course the stills can also be used to make and sell clear spirits like gin white rum and vodka to pay the bills. That makes the barrier to entry a lot lower for new enterprises in the US – expect to see even more of these small producers going big time in the near future.Peach Street Distillers from Palisade Colorado makes a Colorado Straight Bourbon (a legal designation – the first of its kind in Colorado) aged at least 2 years in new oak. Unlike most modern brown spirits Peach Street distills its mash ONCE before racking into oak. Presumably this makes for a lower barrel-entry strength while retaining some extra character from the original mash. The mash is made from 60% locally-grown sweet corn 20% rye and 20% double-row unmalted barley. Barley catalyzes the fermentation of the other ingredients and is commonly added to corn-based whiskes although not usually in this high proportion. Peach Street sticks to its craft sensibilities making batches of less than 200 barrels each.Nose Cinnamon red hots SPICY. A bit hot in the nose for 46%. Anise seed spiced orange peel caraway baked apples.Palate Hot young and excitable. Spices again. Some oak. Potently flavored. Bright – an enthusiastic newcomer.Finish Medium long. Taffy? Black licorice abounds. Some nice mild barrel tannins.With Water Adds some grass on the nose and fresh raw corn. Makes the palate sweeter.Overall Well it’s quite good. It has the air of an excited young pupppy full of life and excitement and bounding with energy as opposed to some older bourbons which are like plodding old hounds wise in their years and contemplative. Unfortunately young craft whiskey comes at a price. $63 for a 2 year-old bourbon? That’s the kind of price I might pay after touring the distillery and bringing home a souvenir bottle… but it’s unlikely to become a staple bourbon in my house with such a pricetag.
349,Penderyn Madeira Single Malt Welsh Whisky - Nothing says “Whisky Boom” like new distilleries cropping up in countries that have no history of whisky production. It doesn’t take long for a country with celtic ties to notice the wild explosion in international whisky fervor and stick some new make into a few barrels. The Welsh Whisky Company built its Penderyn Distillery in the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales in 2000 and began distilling whisky from a mash brewed by nearby Brains Brewery. Penderyn uses an usual pot still designed by Dr. David Faraday which uses a 660 gallon copper pot still fed into a pair of rectifying columns. This hybrid approach produces new make in a single pass but maintains the elegance and flavor associated with the use of copper pot stills. The spirit is aged in Buffalo Trace first-fill ex-bourbon barrels followed by a six month dip in ex-Madeira casks. The company also sells a sherry wood expression and a peated whisky (made by filling spirit into peated refill scotch barrels). Penderyn whisky is bottled without an age statement and without chill-filtration.Nose The first word that comes to mind is “clean”. Penderyn smells clean like freshly-folded laundry or sparklingly clear spring water. The aroma laser-focuses on crushed nuts lemon peel and white chocolate fudge with a tart high note of fresh plum or green grapes.Palate Creamy mouthfeel. Moderate tongue burn. Very nutty with layers of pistachio and hazelnut over a bed of crisp roasted malt. The madeira only comes through on the end with notes of golden raisin and a bare touch of balsamic.Finish Medium-long. Drying with a bit of grape-skin tannin and even more nuttiness. Ends pleasantly with no bitterness.With Water A few drops of water release a bumper crop of grape skins and white vermouth making the nose somewhat drier. The palate is still creamy and is undiminished by the water which also pulls out a little more pure barley flavor. Try this both with and without water.Overall An excellent example of how high-quality a whisky can be made outside of the traditional whiskymaking countries. Penderyn is focused superbly balanced eminently flavorsome and crystal clean. All at the correct strength – 46%. I could have been tricked into thinking this was a single-grain whisky with all of that creaminess and clarity. A pleasure.I marked this ‘Must Try’ because even though it doesn’t offer anything that’s unique in the whisky world I believe that whisky drinkers should expand their horizons and taste the products – when of high quality – of every producer worldwide. With Penderyn you can cross Wales off of your list!
350,Pendleton Canadian Whisky - As whisky consumers in the United States we are at a serious Canadian whisky disadvantage and most of us don’t know it. The largest proportion of Canadian whisky available for purchase in the United States (both by volume and by number of brands) is adulterated slop imported via tanker truck and bottled for sale in plants in the US. Think of it this way Imagine if the only scotch available to you in bars or liquor stores was Johnnie Walker Red Label and Cutty Sark. Want a single-malt or a well-crafted blend? Better go to Europe to buy it. That’s the situation with Canadian whisky. The few quality spirits that emigrate from Canada (such as Forty Creek products) are relatively hard to find in stores especially the limited edition whiskies.The reason I bring this up is not to criticize the Canadian Whisky industry but rather to highlight the reason that whisky drinkers in the US have a hard bias against Canadian whisky and thus have a strong misconception that all Canadian whisky is both “light” in flavor and low in quality.Is Pendleton Blended Canadian Whisky imported and bottled by Hood River Distillers in Oregon here to save US drinkers from a fate of tepid grain-heavy adulterated brown vodka? (Note that Hood River Distillers recently purchased craft spirits hero Clear Creek Distillery makers of McCarthy’s Oregon Single Malt Whisky). Alas no. Pendleton like Canadian whisky “8 Seconds” is riding a curious wave of Canadian whisky popularity among rodeo fans. Their marketing materials website and bottle iconography are rife with references to cowboys bucking broncos and “life on the trail.” Why is Canadian whisky filling the apparent void in Western-appropriate whisky? I have no earthly clue.As befits a product that puts demographic over quality the whisky is a largely undisclosed blend of bulk Canadian whisky brought to bottling proof (40% ABV) using “glacier-fed” spring water from Mt. Hood in Oregon. Under “facts” on the companies web page you can find out that the whisky was aged in oak (really?) and “Each bottle prominently features the rodeo’s famous bucking horse symbol and Let’er Buck slogan.” Oh. Well now I’m sold!Nose A lot of rye spice almost too much. Heavy caramel slightly chemical.Palate Very thick creamy. Indeed syrupy. Maple syrup (Seriously? Way to stereotype Noob) a veneer of cinnamon and clove and a dose of high-fructose corn syrup.Finish Medium length. Sweet and syrupy again like allspice-infused corn syrup. Unfortunate chemical twist at the end like aerosol.With Water Water adds some vanilla but the nose becomes cloying. Thins the body somewhat. Makes the rye spices clearer on the finish.Overall Well. This is about 200% better than Ellington Reserve 8 year but it’s still very sweet and has a chemical aftertaste that I’m not fond of. Of course it’s intended for mixing but wouldn’t you prefer to mix your cocktails with something that tastes good on its own? I wouldn’t buy it. It’s not as wholly bad as many of the other bulk Canadian whisky products sold in the US but it’s not a reason to warm to the market segment.
351,Pig’s Nose Blended Scotch - Something about the Scottish sense of humor just can’t help itself I guess. Pig’s Nose. Sheep Dip. Monkey Shoulder. Pig’s Nose is a blended scotch from Ian McCloud makers of Smokehead Sheep Dip Isle of Skye owners of the Glengoyne and Tamdhu distilleries and the name behind well a bunch of other brands.Unlike the other animal references which are slang phrases that evolved from whiskeymaking Pig’s Nose refers to the whisky being as “smooth as a pig’s nose”. I’ll have to take that one on faith having never personally felt the nose of a pig. The blend contains 5 year-old grain whisky from Invergordon as well as 5 single malts (3 Speysiders 1 Highland and 1 Islay). The recipe has likely changed at least once as another source refers to a Lowland malt as well. The blend was assembled by famous scotch whisky ambassador and blender Richard Paterson aka “The Nose”. It’s bottled at 40% ABV and retails for a strangely wide range of prices between $23 and almost $40.Nose Quintessential blended scotch dry hay lemon peel and some faint peat that is on the maritime side (briny). Comes across a bit watery at this proof. A brief rest in the glass opens up more sweetness in the form of vanilla buttercream frosting.Palate Syrupy body. Mild tongue burn and not as watery as the aroma suggested even at 40% ABV. Sweetness emerges first with light toffee and white chocolate. Next the grain appears in the form of fresh hay and puffed oats. Lastly the peat leaves a twist of earthiness.Finish Short. The peat is more evident here along with cocoa nibs bitter charcoal and walnuts. Fades quickly leaving some sooty bitterness as the last note.With Water A sparse few drops of water have little to no apparent effect on the aroma. The palate seems more spirity (like vodka). Skip water here.Overall The addition of an Islay peat is no doubt intended to make this blend complex but instead I find that it just distracts from the rather surprising purity of the grain and malt despite the (I’m assuming) young age. The finish is a bit of a disappointment… I expected it to be brief but did not expect so much lingering acrid bitterness. I don’t know if that’s from the peat or not but it’s a little unpleasant. The rest of the experience though is nice and certainly performs well for the price.Speaking of price it seems to vary. I gave this a “Try Before Buy” rating because it’s not as good as Bank Note 5 year which is my benchmark for budget blended scotch. If you can only find it for above $30 a bottle I would call this “Not Recommended”. In that case try Bank Note or Cutty Sark Prohibition instead.
352,Pike Creek Canadian Whisky (Port Finish) - The latest in my blog series on “Too Little Too Late” I now bring you a discontinued Canadian whisky! I bought this bottle on closeout last year forgot about it and finally cracked it open to taste after the last few bottles vanished from store shelves to be replaced by a 10 year-old rum-finished edition that is likely nothing like this one. Oh well I bought it so now I’m reviewing it.Pike Creek is another in a spate of Canadian whisky brand revivals along with Lot 40 and Gooderham & Worts from Corby Distillers. From 2012 until 2016 or so Pike Creek was available as a 10 year-old Port Finish edition in Canada and a Port Finish edition in the US which is only aged 7 years although this is not disclosed on the label. The US version is younger because the producer felt that demand for the new brand would outstrip supply. Thanks Canada. Demand must not have been all that after all because both were discontinued and have been replaced by a single 10 year-old Rum Finish edition. I am an ardent Lot 40 admirer which I still refer to as my favorite Canadian whisky so when I saw a port finish from the same distillery (it’s made at the Hiram Walker plant in Winsor Ontario and now owned by Pernod Ricard) on closeout for $14 (normally closer to $30) my better sense abandoned me and I ordered it.Pike Creek is double-distilled on copper column stills from corn. I’m not really an expert on the technical aspects of distillation methods but column stills do not “batch” like pot stills – the distillate runs out at the target proof – so I’m not sure HOW you double distill something on a column still whether it’s made out of copper or not. The whisky is aged in Ontario Canada in a non-climate controlled warehouse. This is important because the extreme climate fluctuations cause the wood to expand and contract which is crucial for oak maturation. The barrels are first-fill ex-bourbon casks and they are filled into “vintage” port barrels of undisclosed origin for an undisclosed amount of time but I would guess only a matter of months. The whisky is bottled at the legal minimum of 40% ABV and has caramel coloring added for “consistency”.The label which is topped off by an awkward twine knot is a word salad of trendy whisky phrases “Finished” “Vintage” “Port Barrels” “Double Barrel” and “Crafted by the Elements”. When looking at labels like this I’m often reminded of the saying “Watch out for people who are always bragging about who they are. A lion will never have to tell you it’s a lion.”Nose Piercing nose tickle surprising for such a low ABV. The initial impression is of fruit punch with artificial sweetener in it. Saccharine sticky and cloying. Next you realize the nose tickle smells like repulsive bottom-shelf vodka mixed with nail polish remover. The fruit is one-dimensional and smells of fruit-flavored candy rather than actual fruit.Palate Syrupy body. Mild tongue burn. There is a wood note (oak sugars) which is welcome but the cheap vodka flavor invades quickly as does the aspartame and candy notes.Finish Medium-long unfortunately. Warming with a little bit of caramel and oak mixed with the unrelenting vodka notes. Finishes with a bit of port wine which finally tastes slightly like something real. This is however marred by the sudden appearance of charcoal bitterness which is all that remains when the finish fades.With Water I’m not sure why you’d bother but a few drops of water actually increase the nose tickle which now feels like someone is painting acetone on the inside of my nostrils with one of those nail polish brushes. The palate is thinner and tastes watery in addition to all the terrible things that it already was. The finish is unchanged. Eyuchhh.Overall I’m not sure I’ve ever had such an irredeemably awful glass of whisky. The liquid provides ample warning of what’s to come with its repugnant aroma and those that fail to heed the signs will be greeted by an increasingly wretched experience right down to the unmercifully long finish. Maybe it would have been more bearable if the “Elements” that “Crafted” it had been allowed another 3 years to work. If you happen to see some of these bottles still lying around on sale I can’t say this often or loudly enough Do Not Buy This Whisky.I really really hope that the new 10 year-old rum finished version of this is an improvement but I’m now gun-shy about putting down actual money to try it.By the way I stopped doing tastings at this point because I was afraid the Pike Creek residue in my mouth would ruin the next whisky I tasted. The one and only piece of good news This stuff can be successfully drowned in a cocktail with enough bitters and ice. There’s a lesson in there.
353,Pikesville Rye - Well now this is refreshing. A rye bottled at a decent proof with an age statement on the back label (6 years) which was distilled and bottled by the company on the label (Heaven Hill Distillery). Glory be. You wouldn’t expect it to be hard to find a whisky that is actually made by the people listed on the label but here we are.Heaven Hill produces myriad brands including the eponymous Heaven Hill Bourbon (I love that word and I never get to use it…) Evan Williams Elijah Craig Bernheim Wheat Whiskey Henry McKenna Larceny Old Fitzgerald Parker’s Heritage and Rittenhouse Rye.The Pikesville brand was a pre-Prohibition (and post- until distillation ceased in 1972) Maryland rye. The brand now claims the distinction of being the last Maryland rye brand to fall despite the category’s once prolific market presence. Heaven Hill brought the brand (although not the Maryland origin) back to life in 2015 using stocks of 6 year-old Heaven Hill rye. The whiskey now sold under the Pikesville brand is a 6 year-old straight rye whiskey distilled in-house at Heaven Hill’s “Old” Bernheim Distillery in Louisville KY from a mashbill of 51% rye (a minimum requirement for “straight rye”) 39% corn and 10% malted barley. It’s bottled at a robust 55% ABV.It’s possible that this is in fact Rittenhouse Rye with 2 extra years of age and 10 more proof on it.Nose Dusty warehouse floor – nearly fungal – with a coating of dry cocoa powder. These two aromas are so dominant that they wash out anything else. Chocolate warehouse floor. Check. A rest in the glass draws out a faint balsamic vinegar note and eventually seems to tame some of the weirdness leaving pumpernickel bread and toffee.Palate Medium body almost syrupy. Tongue burn is surprisingly moderate for something that’s nearly cask strength. Dark brooding oaky tannins dense burnt caramel horehound (boiled hard candies) and Moxie soda.Finish Short. Shoe leather balsamic vinegar rosemary (??) and pine tar. A tinge of charcoal and then it fades rapidly leaving only a remnant of dry oak.With Water A few drops of water bring back the crazy aromas and also adds enough sweetness to really drive home the root beer notes. I recommend nosing this neat and then again after a rest and then add a little water and start over. The experience does change.Overall Whew this one is all over the place. It comes across much older (and much dryer) than you’d expect for a 6 year-old rye but that apparent age has not translated into “smoothness” or mellow well-rounded flavors. Instead everything you expect from a rye seems to have sunk into a bubbling tarpit of eclectic and not-quite-off flavors with random stuff jumping out at you and then sinking just as suddenly back into the bog. ‘Complex’ doesn’t really cover it. You could definitely spend some time analyzing this one. Note that most of this is lost in a cocktail where it just tastes like basic dry rye without much sweetness.I’m going to give this a “Must Try” because it’s one of the most individual and unusual ryes readily available on the shelves these days even if it doesn’t fit the classic definition of “Good”. When you find something different in a sea of same-y sourced young ryes that actually has a real distillery and an age statement on it you cling to it like a life raft. For that matter it’s also hard to find ryes proofed above 100.Sure it’s $40 (in some places $50) which is high for any American whiskey but it’s probably an experience worth having at that price and you’re not likely to need to buy a second bottle.
354,Port Askaig 110 Proof - Stop me if you’ve heard this tune before. Independent bottler or importer with a few industry connections wants to get in on the current whisky craze but doesn’t happen to own a distillery. Why let that stop you? Buy a few barrels of something on the independent market optionally do something minor to distinguish your barrels against the official bottling from the same distillery and then release a “small batch” vatting under a creative new label… perhaps named after an obscure Gaelic legend or just a handy Scottish town or geographical feature. Fill the label with depictions of the artisanship of handmade whisky and/or the meticulous “selection” – by hand of course – of just the absolute most perfect barrels to bring you blah blah blah. If I sound jaded and angry it’s frankly because I’m a little sick of “new” releases that are just the same whisky that has been on the shelf for decades but a little younger with a little less transparency on the label and at a higher price. Oh but excuse me this is small batch. My bad.To its credit this first US release of Port Askaig (named you guessed it after a port town on the Scottish island of Islay) is bottled at cask-strength (55% ABV) and without chill-filtration or added coloring from a small batch of “2 to 40” barrels per batch which means whatever you’d like it to mean. The barrels in question are from an “unnamed” Islay distillery and are all ex-bourbon casks. Different releases of Port Askaig in the future are likely to be (or at least could be) from different Islay distilleries. This one is almost certainly Caol Ila based on exhaustive weeks of Internet research plus me putting my nose in a glass of the stuff.Note that there are several age-stated versions of Port Askaig available in the UK and other markets which we should expect to arrive on US shores at some point. No doubt they will be horrendously expensive if they feel they can get away with charging $75 for NAS single malt at cask strength. “They” in this case is Elixir Distillers (not distillers in fact) who also bottle the Elements of Islay series of bottlings. Thanks to ImpEx for the sample!Nose Ashy meaty smoke reminds me of charred meat roasting over an open wood fire. Singed dry grasses (hay) like the scent of a distant wildfire. Dry malt with a lot of nose tickle if you venture deeper into the glass. Some very faint vanilla.Palate Thin body. Robust tongue burn in fact pretty fiery for a 55% which suggest the age might be on the shorter side (6 years is my wholly unsubstantiated guess). Dry on the tongue with more charred meat and heavily toasted multigrain bread. Finish Concentrated smoke like bottled “liquid smoke” – almost verging on hickory. Fades without bitterness and also without much dimension.With Water Several drops of water adds little instead roughening up the nose tickle. The finish is a little better balanced with some sweet malty notes to counter the dry smoke. I’d only bother with the water if you find the ABV too high to enjoy neat.Overall If $75 for a bottle of NAS Caol Ila at Cask Strength sounds appealing to you go ahead and buy in. If not you’re not missing a heck of a lot. In a day and age where I can still buy Caol Ila 12 year for $60 Talisker 10 year for $50 and Laphroaig 10 for $33 I don’t see where this fits into the market. Cask strength is something I suppose but even then Ardbeg Uigeadail is around this same price and Laphroaig 10 CS is around $10 less. Both are better.
355,Powers John’s Lane (12 year) Irish Whiskey - The pantheon of Irish Single Pot Still Whiskies is small but I personally consider the style to be one of my favorites. Something about the distillation of malted barley (as in single malt) with unmalted barley in the same pot still plumbs the depths of that grain’s capacity for complexity while offering more body and an almost inherent polish that’s hard to find equaled even in the world of single malt scotch. I’ve reviewed a book on the subject and my original review of Redbreast 12 contains my thoughts on the style as a whole.Despite the “Powers” name this release bears little resemblance to the bottom-shelf Powers blend which is a typical Irish blended whiskey containing both pot-still whiskey and cheap grain whiskey. The John’s Lane bottling is 100% single (formerly “pure”) pot still Irish whiskey. It has as much relation to blended Powers as Aberfeldy single malt has to Dewar’s or Mortlach to Johnnie Walker.It’s worth pointing out that Powers John’s Lane and Redbreast are almost the same whiskey. Both are triple-distilled in copper pot stills by Midleton from a recipe of both malted and unmalted barley and both aged for 12 years in ex-bourbon and sherry casks although Redbreast uses a far higher percentage of sherry. John’s Lane boasts a lack of chill filtration and a slightly higher bottling proof (46% versus 40%) but also a substantially higher price tag. Recipes are hard to come by but it appears that John’s Lane uses a heavier “mod pot” distillate than Green Spot or Redbreast. (Midleton is known for being able to produce a virtuosic range of distillates from the same pot stills.)Let’s see how they compare in the glass.Nose Rich! Dense honey dried apricots nutmeg brown sugar. Decadent and full. Only a very light touch of the single pot still signature oiliness which usually smells to me like soot and engine grease (but in a good way?). A rest in the glass develops the hearty coconut note that I find in Redbreast 12.Palate Medium oily body. A surge of coconut water greets the tongue which burns almost imperceptibly. The flavors then unfold as promised by the aroma – decadent caramelized sugars gingerbread and spice cookies candied nuts and chewy nougat.Finish A hint of soot a sparkle of sweet green barley and a total lack of bitterness accompany the fading remnants of the palate notes. Turns drier as it departs but without much tannin.With Water A few drops of water release a flurry of grassy notes licorice (anise) black pepper. The palate gains a slight tartness – apricot again – but is more muddled. The finish may be brighter with a hint of mint. Water is a curiosity here but definitely taste without the water first.Overall This is very similar to Redbreast 12 although with a few marked differences It lacks some of the chewy body and industrial oils that make Redbreast (and this style) distinctive but it trades on those weaknesses to offer heightened sweetness mellow balance polish and a total lack of “off notes” like raw green barley or vegetal bitterness. I’ve started to think of John’s Lane as “dessert Redbreast” but the truth is that a beginner to the style is unlikely to notice (or care about) the differences. Considering that Redbreast is $47 at my local store and John’s Lane is $70 I would only suggest this to lovers of the style who are bored with Redbreast and find Green Spot too mild. At $70 this is definitely a “splurge” bottle for me. Note that some retailers appear to be discounting this to the $55 range – I’d consider that a steal.I’m calling this a “Must Try” only if you’ve already tried (and appreciated) Redbreast 12. If not think of that one as a “Must” first.
356,Prichard’s Rye - Unlike a lot of the masses of new ryes on the American market which are all sourced from MGP or other established bulk producers (or cooked up on a gin still) Prichard’s Rye is made at the first new distillery built in Tennessee since Prohibition. Built in 1997 and utilizing copper pot stills Prichard’s is making traditional American rye aged 3 to 5 years from a mash of 70% rye 15% white corn and 15% malted barley. The rye is bottled at 43% ABV. Prichard’s also makes a variety of spirits including rum bourbon Tennessee whiskey malt whiskey white dog (“white lightning”) and a few liqueurs.This particular sample collected from bottle in April 2015 was included in my Flaviar “Ryevolution” tasting box. Ironically that means it was distilled and aged in Tennessee shipped to Europe poured into a glass vial sealed and shipped back to me in California. That’s bad news for my carbon footprint! It’s also a good case for why rebottling of spirits should be made legal in the US. Think of how easy it would be to taste a wide variety of new spirits if services like Master of Malt and Flaviar existed in the States!Nose A root beer float with vanilla ice cream. The rye spice notes are mellow and understated – instead of cinnamon red-hots and sharp star anise there is a warm spice glow like mulled wine. There are also assorted rooty extract notes that I’m not qualified to identify. The overall impression is sweet and herbal. After a lengthy rest in the glass sweeter notes like candy corn and taffy come out.Palate Thin body. A faint banana note plays with dusty cinnamon and clove. Very moderate tongue burn. A little on the dry side.Finish Dry and herbal. Ginger. A little bitterness emerges on the fade-out which is mostly charcoal.With Water A little water wakes up some of the expected rye spice notes (clove nutmeg) but that’s about it. I’d consider the water to be optional.Overall Well I like it better than Rittenhouse Rye for sipping as it’s well-rounded balanced properly for a rye whiskey (not too sweet) and doesn’t have any off-flavors or “young rye” (eucalyptus) notes. That said there’s nothing that stands out to me as a reason to recommend it unless you want a rye that’s squarely in the middle of the road. For the money I prefer Hochstadter’s Rye. Really though you won’t be disappointed unless you’re as jaded as I am so I’m thinking this is a solid “Recommended”. If you do pour a glass to sip give it about fifteen minutes to develop.
357,Rebel Yell Small Batch Reserve Bourbon - Let’s keep on with our recent Luxco kick with another future classic The Rebel Yell Small Batch Reserve Bourbon because if it’s “Reserve” it has to be good. Right?Distilled by “Rebel Yell Distillery Louisville KY” (The Internet Which Knowest All Things says this is probably Heaven Hill) the bottle contains Kentucky Straight Bourbon bottled in “small batches” from a wheat-flavored mash bill at 45.3% ABV. Luxco compatriot David Nicholson 1843 is also a wheater. Long a resident of the Bottom Shelf Club Rebel Yell is a favorite of everyone from the college-guy-sent-to-the-liquor-store-with-a-fistful-of-fives-to-get-booze to the hobo-on-the-corner-with-enough-class-to-not-be-drinking-vodka. It’s hard to argue with $13 a fifth until you taste it anyway. So why not fork over an extra Hamilton (that’s a $10 bill for my readers from outside the United States and some inside. Public school system!) for the same thing with a black label with “Reserve” on it?Nose Shy with very faint tropical fruits (kiwi guava) and “fruit punch” bubble gum. Very light otherwise with few of the common bourbon characteristics.Palate Thin body. Bubble gum again with rich coconut. Followed by stale chocolate nibs hazelnut and dusty spice cabinet (like cinnamon so old it’s lost the taste of cinnamon).Finish Short. Some oaky tannins a hint of charcoal faint vanilla and a cloying “fake” processed corn syrup note.With Water Water does not noticeably change the aroma. It might bring out more bubble gum on the palate. No need for water with this one.Overall Disappointing from start to finish. Reminds me of McAfee’s Benchmark No. 8 Basil Hayden and Winchester Straight Bourbon all made at different distilleries but a common thread is a sickening corn syrup candy note and an overwhelming tutti-frutti bubble gum character. I far preferred the Luxco brand’s David Nicholson 1843 also a wheater and only $5 more. If you thought adding “Small Batch Reserve” and $10 to the price of Rebel Yell would make it a competitive bourbon you’d be wrong.
358,Redbreast (12 year) Cask Strength Irish Whiskey - Irish Distillers Limited owners of the Midleton Distillery and many of the brands that are synonymous with Irish Whiskey made a big splash this year by releasing several special editions that show off their monopoly on the classic Irish style of Pure Pot Still Irish Whiskey (now called Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey by law). Two of those releases Barry Crockett Legacy and Powers John’s Lane were priced distinctly out of my comfort range and I’ve duly ignored them. However when IDL released a cask-strength edition of my favorite Irish whiskey (and one of my favorite whiskeys ever) Redbreast 12 year I clamored for a bottle. Intelligently priced at $60 – $65 retail (at 57.7% ABV it’s almost 50% higher strength so pricing it at less than 50% above the non-CS standard bottling is responsible pricing in my opinion) and it’s damn good!Nose Poignant alcohol tickle making it difficult to get an accurate nosing. After a rest in the glass I get a blast of coconut milk cinnamon honey-sweetened iced tea and vanilla. In fact it has all the ingredients of a chai latte. Several more minutes of resting benefits the dram significantly revealing soft maltiness subtle lemon and sugary vanilla icing.Palate A torrent of coconut and spice is followed by mouth-numbing concentrations of alcohol. When the haze clears I get warm notes of brown sugar caramel macchiato a metallic twinge of copper (like licking an old penny) and a peppery herbal twist.Finish Mildly bitter and of medium length. The coconut shows itself and fades followed by black pepper almond skins vanilla saltwater taffy and finally some charred oak.With Water Water brings out the sweetest notes in the nose – mostly vanilla ice cream and processed (white) sugar. It does the same to the palate – softening the rougher edges of the alcohol. It makes the dram sweeter and easier to drink (a plus) but reduces the complexity and totally washes out the coppery oily meaty notes (a minus). Your choice!Overall A powerhouse dram of Irish whiskey that’s more Flogging Molly than The Irish Rovers. At once hectic and well-packaged it demonstrates the intense concentration of flavor possible at cask strength while also showcasing the finer notes of damn fine pot-still Irish whiskey. If single-malt scotch is a refined sporting gentleman this dram is a bare-knuckle boxing Irish dockworker with a dozen pints in him. If you like Redbreast 12 you’ll like this better. If you don’t care for cask-strength or robustly-flavored whiskey stick with the Redbreast 12. This one is loud brazen and powerful – you won’t soon forget the category of Irish whiskey with a glass of this in front of you. Sláinte!
359,"Redbreast (12 year) Irish Whiskey - Just in time for St. Patrick’s Day! I’ll be toasting the emerald isles with Redbreast – that gem of traditional Irish single pot still whiskey.Redbreast is the 100% pure (single) pot still whiskey made by Irish Distillers Ltd. (IDL) at the “New” Midleton distillery. At the same distillery the company’s other brown spirits Jameson and Powers (both blends of grain whiskey with pot still whiskey) are produced using the same stills (three column and four pot stills). A smattering of other whiskeys are made here as well including (by contract) Green Spot and Tullamore Dew. In fact as my brother-in-law likes to put it – Jameson is basically watered-down Redbreast (that is ‘diluted’ with grain whiskey).Irish single pot still whiskey is similar in ethos to single-malt whisky. While the mashbill contains both unmalted and malted barley (usually in a ratio of 60 to 40) unlike single malt the combination of both is distilled in traditional copper pot stills which introduce a lot of character into the spirit (whereas stainless-steel column stills yield light vodka-like grain spirit with little natural character). This yields a complex whiskey with a distinct oily full mouthfeel. This “greasy” style of body is present in spades in Redbreast but is difficult to discern (for me) in the blends containing only 40% pot still whiskey such as Jameson and Powers. Redbreast will always have a spot on my shelf – not just because of the myriad awards it wins but because its unique character and reasonable price point fit perfectly into my rotation of regulars.Nose A shock of greasy toffee and bacon fat a hint of industrial solvent. Lots of spicy dried coconut and white pepper. Right out of the bottle the young grain component (unmalted barley) is a little too sharp – a few minutes undisturbed in the glass will mellow this. Water dulls the nose… Don’t do it!Palate That pot-still greasiness and chewy mouth coating fullness is delectable. Lots of sweet brown sugar or molasses root beer and marshmallow. More dried coconut some black licorice. Water only thins the body.Finish Very long and drenched in coconut mixed dried herbs and lavender. Later the coconut degrades into an impure cane sugar bitterness. Best to wash this away with more Redbreast!Redbreast 12 is a must-try for that unique toothy quality. It’s a must-have because this level of quality just isn’t available at this price in competing single malts. Don’t bother with the water – you’ll only mess with the mouthfeel. Enjoy it as-is.

360,Redemption Rye - Despite claims to be “redeeming” rye from its lost heritage by handcrafting a 95% rye to convince the world of rye whisky’s value this and an embarrassing multitude of other bottled ryes are simply labels slapped on bulk rye produced at LDI (now MGP). Aside from barrel maturation differences bottling strengths and minor differences in age these ryes are all basically the same thingRedemption Templeton Rye Bulleit Rye Willet Rye (until they start releasing whisky from their new KBD plant) High West (at least they blend it skillfully) George Dickel Rye Angel’s Envy Rye (at least they finish it in rum barrels) and a host of other small-time brands that have not come clean about their origins.Now I like a good story as much as the next whisky drinker but the idea of two bottles with different labels (and different prices) containing basically the same juice and with entirely different back-stories on the label just gives me an uneasy feeling. But that’s marketing for you.This bottle is from Batch 104 (I’m guessing that’s a Redemption batch number not an LDI batch!) bottle #1802 bottled at a respectable 46% ABV. Like all the ryes above this is a mash of 95% rye with 5% malted barley aged in new charred oak for less than 4 years. The “less than” is a legal definition for any straight rye whiskey aged between 2 and 4 years. The malted barley if you’re wondering is in there to kickstart fermentation and is usually present in bourbons too regardless of their mashbills.Nose Eucalpytus which shows up sometimes in young rye. Deep underneath there is a small cache of mulling spices (cinnamon clove) and something that might be caraway. Not too much nose tickle even at 46% ABV.Palate Thin body. Minty. The rye grain is lively with a little sweet maltiness. Mostly though it’s eucalyptus and cinnamon. Very ‘smooth’ though with very little tongue burn.Finish Medium-short. Some greener vegetal notes; grassy. Caraway again fading with a hint of fresh cherries and almond extract. Not bitter.With Water Water adds more nose tickle than I like. I don’t see any reason to add water to this.Overall While it’s an unobjectionable sip I think the value of young LDI/MGP rye like this is to serve as the brown spirits in classic American cocktails. There are much more complex ryes for sipping (Rittenhouse 100 for one) and the green notes betray Redemption’s youth. Buy it to drink a glass straight and then mix up some Manhattans with the rest. I’ve marked this ‘Not Recommended’ though because you’re really better off hunting down some Rittenhouse or springing for a clever High West blend. However if you just want some rye to toss in cocktails this will suffice.
361,Rittenhouse Rye 100 Proof - Now that’s more like it. I bought a bottle of Rittenhouse 100 rye purely on a recommendation and I think it’s a fantastic dram for an even more fantastic price. All rye whiskies share a similar flavor profile full of baking spices like nutmeg and cinnamon as well as black and white peppers and middle-eastern spices like cumin clove etc. This one is no exception and is bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV) to boot. It is bottled in bond at approximately 6 years old. Shame on Heaven Hill Distilleries for not providing a website – or even a page on their own website – for this brand.Nose Cinnamon clove black pepper. Big spicy rye presence without too much nose tickle. Smooth and peppery. A little sweet overtone of marshmallow and black cherry. Also there’s a big oak influence – verging on woody. A few drops of water seem to dull the nose.Palate Medium body without much heft. The higher proof makes itself felt on the tongue but quickly gives way to smoke with charred wood upfront and a suggestion of smoked meat. Next there is a range of tobacco clove cinnamon allspice and brown sugar. A crackling Thanksgiving turkey comes to mind or a pumpkin spice latte.Finish Long evolving through spiced chai vanilla black tea and a lingering ghost of spent charcoal and of all things spearmint. A very nice progression without any bitterness. The water coaxes out an extra few sweet notes – butterscotch hard candies and birch beer.Overall A tasty satisfying dram. The smoky and peppery tobacco notes balance very well with the sweeter chai and brown sugar notes. It does not have the overbearing sweetness of some bourbons nor the acrid dryness of some ryes. Not ground-breaking but very much worth the price of a bottle. This is the kind of “ah hah!” flavor that brings life to the “American whiskey is a good value” adage. It’s certainly not true of several whiskies I’ve tried recently but this one almost makes up for all of those. 😉 If you’re curious about rye and want to taste a good one without shelling out for something top-shelf get a bottle of this.
362,Rowan’s Creek Bourbon - I’ve passed by this one on the shelves for years always looking for something more important. I think I knew vaguely that it was (yet another) sourced bourbon but it disappears in a sea of vaguely rural-looking and -sounding American whiskies. I finally picked up a bottle (as I always say “Worst case? Old Fashioneds!”) and gave it a try.Rowan’s Creek despite listing “Rowan’s Creek Distillery” as the bottler on the label is a brand owned by Willett (formerly known as Kentucky Bourbon Distillers or KBD) and sourced from somewhere else. It is straight Kentucky bourbon bottled at the obnoxious ABV of 50.05% presumably so they can say it’s 100.1 proof. Y tho? The whisky is named after the creek that runs through the Willett distillery grounds.Apparently the bottle used to boast a 12-year age statement but does no longer. It is instead a small batch vatting of purportedly 5-15 year-old barrels. This switch may account for some older reviews online praising the consistency and quality of the bourbon which seems to have erm slipped. Nobody online seems to know where Rowan’s Creek is actually distilled or what its mashbill is or when or if it will switch over to distillate from the Willett Family’s distillery which opened and began distilling in 2012. I’ve seen some guesses that it might be Heaven Hill and that it might be a high-rye mashbill but those are both unsubstantiated.My bottle is from Batch QBC No 19-1.Nose Sweet unctuous bourbon with a corn-heavy sweetness up front and a dense oak profile. After a rest in the glass it’s still fairly shy.Palate Medium bodied. Powerful tongue burn as expected for 100 proof. Oaky with a dark sappy sweetness and a heavy dose of concentrated rye spices. Reminds me a bit of allspice dram with all the clove and pumpkin-spice flavor.Finish Medium long. A continuation of the oak-dominated sweetness from the palate. Fades gradually without evolving.With Water Several drops of water seem to have no effect on the aroma or palate. They do add a welcome nuttiness to the finish. Water optional but not a terrible idea.Overall Despite the deceptive complexity of the oak-derived flavors (resin sap oak tannin etc.) there isn’t much else going on here. The dose of rye spice is patchy and inconsistent and the sugar notes are one-dimensional. This is certainly better than most $20 bourbons but I don’t think it quite stretches to the $35 ones. For example I would much rather drink Legent or Dickel BIB than this.
363,Royal Lochnagar (12 year) - Yet another of Diageo’s stable of “blending fodder” – some malt distilled at Lochnagar finds its way into Johnnie Walker (Blue in particular) and Vat 69 but the majority of the output of Diageo’s smallest distillery (smallest in production volume that is) is now bottled as a single malt. This includes a Distiller’s Edition finished in Moscatel casks and an NAS Selected Reserve edition aged in sherry casks. The distillery’s single malt does not seem to find distribution into the US except via a few independent bottlings which are few and far between.The official portfolio labels underwent a recent redesign.Nose Grain-forward (puffed barley) lemon peel fresh banana airy with light fruits and mild floral perfume. A rest in the glass only intensifies the banana notes. I don’t know what banana flowers smell like but I’d guess it’s something like this.Palate Thin body. Some vanilla sweetness and coconut water tame tongue burn and a dry austere nuttiness like unsalted raw almonds. Fresh though. It reminds me of those scented candles that say “Fresh Laundry” or “Fresh Air”.Finish Short. A reprise of the palate notes but with a bit of mouth-drying tannin and a wash of mild bitterness. Gone in an instant.With Water A few drops of water seem to dampen the aroma and also increase the nose tickle (it wasn’t noticeable before). The palate is a bit washed-out. At 40% this needs no additional water.Overall I mean it’s OK. A very standard Highland malt from a very standard (likely refill) combination of sherry and ex-bourbon casks. Even at 12 years of age it has little maturity or development and zero complexity. The only off-note is the bitterness on the finish but it’s not balanced by any interesting characteristics. A disappointment for more than $25. Not something I would bother to carry back to the US on a plane (or pay shipping from the UK!). 
364,Russell’s Reserve (10 year) Bourbon - Wild Turkey long-time champion of the bottom bourbon shelf has been steadily expanding their range with ryes reserves small batches and single barrels plus whatever “Forgiven” is (Update now I know!). The line of Russell’s Reserve bourbons and ryes are crafted by (and named after) legendary master distiller Jimmy Russell and his son Eddie Russell. Aged a full 10 years (hear hear for age statements!) and bottled in small batches (a meaningless term these days basically an excuse for batch variability) Russell’s Reserve is reportedly made from a mashbill of 75% corn 13% rye and 12% barley. The barrels used in each batch are chosen by Jimmy and Eddie and are from the center of the Wild Turkey rickhouses.Nose Nutty. Furniture polish marzipan butter toffee. Mostly though it’s furniture polish. A rest in the glass sweetens up the aroma a bit with some buttercream frosting and better balance.Palate Thin bodied. Moderate tongue burn. The first impression is of honey-roasted peanuts or candied almonds. Then the woodsy notes arrive with more furniture polish and oak sawdust.Finish Medium-long. Nutty and mostly without bitterness. A reprise of the butter toffee and finishes nicely with a very pleasant frosted cinnamon-bun flavor.With Water Several drops of water wake up the nose a bit but fail to change the component aromas or overall balance. The palate seems a little thicker but more muddled. The finish is tarter and there’s more rye-delivered cinnamon and clove notes which also come across when this is used to make cocktails. Water (or ice) totally optional when sipping.Overall I can’t find much to recommend this over any other bourbon in a +/- $20 range. It’s better than your bottom-shelfers but it suffers from a lack of robustness and an unfortunate leaning towards the “furniture polish” side of oakiness rather than the “buttery sweet” side. The rest of my bottle made a series of totally acceptable Old Fashioneds but then that’s pretty much true of any bourbon over $20 a bottle (and a few under that). If you’re a huge fan of Wild Turkey’s focus on cereal notes you might consider this a worthwhile upgrade.
365,Ryan and Wood Straight Rye - A little bit out of the norm for me today. I generally write about easy-to-find and easy-to-get (except the Pappy’s of course) whiskies. Here I have my tasting notes from a sample sent to me from a buddy on the East Coast who found this tiny craft distillery in Gloucester Massachusetts. They just finished bottling their first-ever batch of Straight Rye whiskey (although they’ve been making vodka gin and rum for awhile). In fact it’s so new they haven’t even added it to their website yet.Ryan and Wood Straight Rye Whiskey is just under three years of age matured in Massachusetts in new charred oak barrels. The mash is rye wheat and malted barley and it was barreled in July of 2008 / bottled April 2011 at 43% ABV. The first four barrels (1200 bottles) are 50-gallon size while the next batches will all be matured in 30-gallon barrels. It will be interesting to see how that alters the flavor profile.Nose Very piney. Spruce. Gin notes juniper berries. Eucalyptus? Some lurking muscat grapes. Surprisingly subtle nose – very little prickle. Very mature for a young whiskey.Palate Very nice body – structured and silky. Smooth again little burn. More typical rye flavors – cinnamon and clove with a little sweet corn. Further in there is sweet blueberries toasted oak (in a Chardonnay style – buttery and round) and more pine sap.Finish Lingering – piney and grassy. A drop of honey. Some clover and then lavender. Elegant.Overall For a first-time effort from a small craft distillery this is excellent stuff. Much more mature for its age than I’d expect. Underpriced at $30. Here’s hoping it only gets better with time!
366,Sagamore Spirit “Calvados Finish” Rye - I was shocked – shocked! – at how good Sagamore Spirit’s baseline rye is especially because it – like a dizzying array of other products on the shelf – is just blended MGP rye. Something about the combination of skillful blending and skillful barrel selection has allowed Sagamore to elevate the category of sourced rye. That’s not something I thought was possible without building a distillery which of course Sagamore Spirit has also done (construction finished in 2017).Anyone who reads this blog knows that I’m a sucker for a Calvados finish. They’re super rare though so when I spotted this one on the shelf I didn’t even blink at the $66 price tag and lack of an age statement.Like the baseline rye this is a blend of straight rye whiskies all sourced from MGP (Midwest Grain Products the artist formerly known as LDI). The website reveals the age to be 4-5 years (so 4) but doesn’t specify the amount of time spent finishing in Calvados barrels. This bottling is a part of Sagamore Spirit’s “Reserve Series” which includes Cognac Port and various wine finishes. This Calvados Finish is bottled at a robust 50.6% ABV. My bottle is from Batch 1A which I’m guessing means the first batch.Nose Ah yes no mistaking the calvados. Sticky dried apples oaky brandy and a smattering of rye spices. This smells exactly like mulled cider if mulled cider were 101 proof. There is a lot of nose tickle but the aromas are also robust and deep. Palate Medium body. Sweet with oaky vanilla thick slices of dried apple marshmallow and a sachet of mulling spices. It tastes just what the aroma promised and the tongue burn is moderate. Yum.Finish Medium-long. A little barrel char – slightly bitter – takes over and the finish becomes dry. Ghosts of clove cinnamon cardamom and a touch of anise (black licorice) linger.With Water A few drops of water refresh the aroma which had been flagging after a rest in the glass. The water doesn’t however add anything new. The palate seems a little thinner. I would only suggest using water with this if it seems too hot to you or if you want to experiment with the proof.Overall This is exactly what I thought I would be getting when I read the label. It uses Sagamore Spirit’s well-chosen and well-blended MGP rye as a kind of sweet-and-spicy canvas for the delectable apple notes from the apparently very active calvados cask. We’re not talking about a faint wisp of apple here. Apple is center-stage and unlike some cheaper apple brandies the fruit comes through clear and concentrated.I’ve always been an easy mark for a calvados finish and this one delivers precisely. That makes it so very worth the price to me. $66 might be a bit of an ask if you’re not already an apple brandy fan though or if you balk at the idea of paying craft prices for MGP liquid.
367,Sagamore Spirit Cask Strength Rye - A few weeks ago I reviewed Sagamore Spirit’s Rye and I thought pretty highly of it even though it’s a blend of sourced whiskies from MGP. I was contacted by Liz from Sagamore Spirit’s PR firm to clear up some factual details and she offered to send me a sample of the Cask Strength Rye. Unfortunately she was out of samples of young preview whiskey from Sagamore’s newly-built Maryland distillery. While we wait for that liquid to release (the first bottle of own-distilled Sagamore at four years of age should hit shelves in 2021) we can at least enjoy the fruits of Sagamore’s careful blending of contract-distilled MGP juice. As I’ve said before on this blog whilst denigrating producers that use it MGP makes excellent whiskey.This is a blend of MGP-distilled straight rye whiskies from two different mash bills at 4 years old. Because these are contract distillations they aren’t just blending tanks of already-aged standard MGP rye but rather specifying the mash bill and barrel entry proof and waiting for the rye to hit target ages before blending them. The first mash bill is 95% rye and 5% malted barley and the second unspecified recipe is 51% rye and some combination of corn and malted barley. The result is bottled at cask strength or close to it (they add a “splash” of Maryland spring water to bring the batch to 56.1% ABV presumably for consistency). All of Sagamore Spirit’s products are made without added coloring but they are chill-filtered. My sample bottle – Thanks Liz! – is 56.1% ABV and is from batch 9AA.Sagamore Spirit is also cask-finishing a number of casks in everything from Cognac to Calvados – here’s my review of the Calvados finish which I bought soon after reviewing the flagship rye. I’m a sucker for Calvados finishes which are far too rare.Nose Cherry syrup with aromatic bitters. The deeper into the glass you go the more the cherry turns sweet and syrupy like a cordial. Rye spices (cinnamon clove) are present but restrained. Almost-astringent wood extracts are prevalent suggesting heavy oak influence.Palate Syrupy body. A strong tongue burn is accompanied by those heavy astringent oak flavors along with mouth-drying tannins. After the burn delectable cherry syrup returns along with walnuts and some molasses-y wood sugars.Finish Medium length. The finish is true to the palate with more of the same. There’s an additional note of balsamic vinegar but no other evolution. Fades without bitterness.With Water The addition of several drops of water initially release a pleasant maple sugar note and additional nuttiness (hazelnuts). The water also mutes the nose tickle a bit making it easier to detect aromas. The palate also becomes silkier and the burn is muted. I heartily suggest adding water to this. In fact experiment with various amounts to see how it changes. When I proof it down to approximately 48% and then (important!) give it a brief rest in the glass the aroma becomes far more floral and fruity the liquid is easier to taste and has less overpowering oak and there’s a new stone fruit (peach?) flavor on the tongue. Try it!Overall Straight out of the bottle this seems to be ALL about the oak with only passing reference to rye. The cherry notes are deep dark and very tasty but there isn’t a lot of complexity otherwise. That said this is one of the most reactive whiskies I’ve had to various amounts of water. It seems like each additional splash of water reveals different flavors. That’s where the complexity is hidden you just have to do a little work to unlock it.Try to find a bottle on sale for $58 which is a totally reasonable price these days for cask-strength rye no matter what the provenance is. The standard retail is closer to $75 which feels a little high to me.
368,Sagamore Spirit Rye - Another week another craft spirit. These are all the same right? More than half of them are just rebottled whisky from LDI/MGP or otherwise sourced and the rest are two year-old craft spirit from some guy with an alembic and a dream. I’ll just pour a little and get this review over with. Stick it on the bottom of the pile. *cartoon screeching noise* Holy… this stuff is actually really good! Sweet and fruit-forward without being cloying… I got all excited until I started reading the fine print.First the bad news. This is indeed rebottled whisky from LDI/MGP. Like just about every upstart distillery in America Sagamore is sourcing their Spirit while the output from their new distillery (built in 2017) ages. I’d expect to see some fanfare in 2021 when the first casks of four year-old spirit are bottled. Until then this is really just excellently-chosen MGP rye. Honestly I don’t know how they did it since there are twenty thousand “craft” ryes on the market that are made at MGP and most of them do not make me sit up and say ‘wow’. On the website they claim that MGP is distilling their “proprietary recipe” but then they all say that. The MGP rye is proofed down (to nearly the legal minimum at 41.5% ABV) with Maryland limestone spring water but that can hardly be the difference.A little searching online reveals that Sagamore is blending two MGP products; a high-rye (95% rye 5% malted barley) and a low-rye (51% rye but an unspecified mash bill probably corn). They are also cask-finishing a number of casks in everything from Cognac to Calvados so they aren’t just resting on MGP’s laurels. There’s also a cask strength rye. If nothing else at least they are revealing the source of their whiskey instead of trying to hide it. Still the proof will be in the bottles released in 2021. We’ll see if they can match or exceed the quality of the MGP liquid. Also then it will finally be “Maryland Rye” instead of Indiana rye bottled in Maryland.Speaking of MGP liquid as much as I belittle producers that use it the fact remains that MGP makes damn fine whiskey and they are able to do it at such scale and low cost that they can supply nearly the entire landscape of the American “craft” whiskey renaissance. Now that’s impressive.My bottle is from Batch 9AV Bottle #2939. All of Sagamore Spirit’s products are made without added coloring but they are chill-filtered.Update I was contacted by a PR rep at Sagamore Spirit to clear something up. Her words “[Sagamore Spirit] did work with MGP until their distillery was up and running they didn’t actually source rye from MGP. Instead Sagamore Spirit contracted production out to exact specifications to MGP until Sagamore Spirit’s own distillery opened in 2017. Instead of buying bulk whiskey and labeling it Sagamore Spirit had MGP custom produce and age it for them.” She tells me that Sagamore feels there’s an important distinction between sourcing bulk spirit (which a lot of brands do) vs. contract distilling. They apparently contracted MGP to distill and age two ryes (95% and 51%) and then Sagamore performed the blending themselves. In other words they had to wait for the ryes they contracted to age instead of going straight to market with already-aged whiskey. When the distillery’s output comes “of age” in 2021 they will no longer use MGP-distilled whisky at all.Nose Soft grain-forward rye. Reminds me of Crown Royal Northern Harvest. Almost floral notes of rosewater orange blossom toasted nutmeg and clove. Spiced but not spicy like mulled wine or sticky monkey bread. Very accomplished – downright polished.Palate Thin body. Tannic with a lot of wood up front. Basically no tongue burn. The rye spices return now accompanied by pliable fresh cinnamon sticks dried cherries and dark brown sugar. Tasty.Finish Of medium length. Spices of course rye to the end. The cherry notes verge a little close to cough syrup before fading.With Water Several drops of water increase the nose tickle but don’t seem to release new aromas. The water also seems to thin the body. I don’t think this rye needs water.Overall A very tasty rye with all of the classic elements of that grain. The spices are especially well-balanced because the grain notes are soft and rounded so the spices complement them rather than standing out or tasting “spicy”. Basically no rough edges or off-notes. This “sweeter style” can be attributed to the blending in of low-rye (aka half corn) spirit.I broke my own rule and read a number of reviews online after writing this and it seems like I’m in a bit of a minority here. Most reviewers seemed to be unimpressed – widely giving Sagamore rye middling scores. Perhaps I’m just a sucker for sweeter whiskies that manage to not be cloying. Perhaps I’m a sucker for good MGP juice. At any rate I liked it enough to buy another bottle.
369,Säntis Dreifaltigkeit (Cask Strength Peated) Single Malt Whisky - In 1999 historic Swiss brewer Brauerei Locher began distilling malted barley sourced from barley fields high in the Swiss mountains smoking it with local peat and storing it in antique oak beer barrels (70 to 140 years old!). The malted barley is smoked “twice” and the casks were also (previously) smoked with oak wood smoke. Bottled at a cask-strength of 52% ABV (pretty low for a cask strength) that makes for a pretty unique malt whisky. This particular sample collected from bottle in December 2014 was included in my Flaviar “Welcome” tasting box. Considering that box is meant to be an introduction to the variety of whiskies for relative newcomers I shudder to think what impact all of that weird smokiness might have had on unsuspecting young whisky drinkers. (Note that I don’t think current Welcome boxes include this one anymore.)Nose Smoke in an umami soy-sauce style. Toasted seaweed (Nori) smoked salmon roasting meats etc. Very savory and very complex. Note that the peat is not strong or overwhelming it’s simply the dominant note in a mildly-aromatic whisky.Palate Thin body. Not much tongue burn considering the high ABV. Much stronger smoke. Alderwood smoke with a sweet edge. This takes like liquid smoked salmon and not the weak grocery store salmon no this is a serious hot-smoked mess.Finish Guess what? Smoke. Slight charcoal but not bitter. Mostly just a reprise of the salty-smoky notes from the aroma.Water Water doesn’t seem to have an appreciable effect aside from reducing the strength. Wholly optional.Overall Wow. This is the single strangest peated malt I’ve ever tasted. All of the peat notes are specifically and only related to salty smoked meats (salmon barbecue etc.) There is a hint of the ocean/seaweed but the overall impression is of liquid smoked salmon. If that sounds good to you (it does to me!) then this is a Must Try. If it sounds gross then by all means skip it. Also you’re not alone A quick perusal of online reviews show that this whisky is very polarizing with a lot of “This is the worst whisky I’ve ever tasted” type of reviews and also some very positive reviews. This is not your standard peated whisky but it is an education. Alas good luck finding a retailer… I found a Dutch whisky shop with this in stock but it would have cost $89 in shipping to the US alone!
370,Sazerac Rye - Sazerac is a word with many definitions. Originally the name of a bar in 1860s New Orleans Sazerac became the name of its signature cocktail a mixture of cognac and bitters. Later when cognac became scarce the recipe was changed to use (probably Canadian) rye whiskey. Thomas Handy the bar’s proprietor began importing liquors and founded The Sazerac Company which today owns (among others) industry bigs like Buffalo Trace Pappy Van Winkle and Barton Brands. Its Sazerac Rye brand is a reminiscence of that earlier time and the “official” rye for use in Sazerac cocktails. An 18 year-old version of this recipe is part of Buffalo Trace’s popular annual Antique Collection release. Unlike the Antique Collection expression this non-age-statement bottling is a basic rye with mass-market sensibilities intended for mixing into cocktails. See my notes below.Nose Bourbon nose. Sweet corn and corn syrup. Black pepper. Cherry pits nutmeg and cayenne. Fair bit of that bourbon new-plastic smell. Heavy nose prickle.Palate Smoky black pepper up front woody and charred. Resolves into sweet cherry syrup and spice notes. Rye but still bourbon-y (corny?).Finish Long and very oaky. Some nice grilling spices mulled cider and smoky hardwood chips.Overall Not bad. A lot more corn than I usually like in my ryes but flavorsome and smooth. No doubt the large majority of this rye’s production is used for making cocktails as there are much better sipping ryes available (personally for the money I much prefer Rittenhouse 100 when I can find it). I would therefore say this is ‘Not Recommended’ unless you’re making cocktails for which Sazerac is well-suited. Kudos to the company however for keeping this at 90 proof instead of the more-common anemic 80.
371,Scapa (16 year) - I’ve been flirting with Scapa for a year now… tasting it here and there but never in a situation where I could contemplate and write about it. It surprised me at WhiskyFest 2011 standing out amid a throng of other whiskies that had me pretty much in the bag by the time I got around to the Scapa table. My notes amount to “Mm! Gud!” Finally I got to have a nice long conversation with a pour of Scapa 16 at K&L this week. It delivers. Just when I was starting to think I’d discovered all the exciting single malts around. It’s not often that I’m taken by a scotch aged solely in ex-bourbon casks (100% first-fill in this case) but the flavors here are deep and focused.Scapa is located by the ocean in the Orkney Isles off the northeastern coast of Scotland’s mainland. Like Highland Park it shares the distinction of being among the northernmost distilleries in Scotland. Unlike Highland Park Scapa does not use the local Orcadian peat to dry its barley. Also unlike Highland Park Scapa restricts itself to aging in those first-fill bourbon barrels which is probably the least intrusive way to age whisky – only a 3rd- or 4th-fill ex-bourbon cask would impart less influence on the whisky. In fact at its essence Scapa is as simple as single malt gets good malt carefully distilled aged in the simplest possible way and bottled without flourishes finishes or fanfare. I only wish it were bottled at 43% ABV and was not chill-filtered alas. I marked it “Must Try” because I feel that Scapa showcases what can be done without fancy barrel finishes. It’s a great whisky to try if you’re looking to step out of the mainstream.Nose Briny. Sugar cookies and vanilla saltwater taffy. Very floral – honeysuckle. Elegant. It rewards a lengthy pondering by evolving more depth – not so much new aromas. It definitely reminds one of the sea – briny air seaweed washed up on shore and driftwood drying in the sun.Palate Light in body and flavor but focused – a nuttiness like salted cashews and distinct vanilla and malt (which continues to show as sugar cookies and saltwater taffy).Finish Light and of medium length. Vanilla bean and fresh dairy cream. Elegant to the last and devoid of bitterness.With Water A surge of banana (ugh) but that fades and reveals syrupy melted ice cream. Definitely try it with a few drops.Overall Quite good. Scapa is light in nature but delivers surprisingly deep and complex variations on the theme. Not just vanilla but rich roasty vanilla. Not just taffy but briny homemade saltwater taffy. Not just a good sipping malt but elegant and accomplished from nose to finish.
372,Sheep Dip - Too often while writing reviews I find myself disassociated from the aroma or flavor notes that I’m trying to convert into words. I haven’t literally put my nose into a honeysuckle blossom in probably twenty years and yet when that honey-sweet floral nectar-y note appears in something I find myself typing the words. Some aroma memories are powerful like that but others are more ethereal. I probably couldn’t really tell you the difference between toffee caramel and nougat and I don’t really have an intensely strong sense-memory of those things. Mostly they smell like cooked sugar I guess.And then along comes a sense memory that is so powerful it snaps you back in time. I grew up in semi-rural New Hampshire and one of the highlights of the year was the county fair. This event was complete with a horse pull competition (or “hawse pull” in the local patois) rickety carnival rides and awards for 4H presentations. I never participated in 4H but our family was acquainted with at least one family that owned sheep and I can recall being near the creatures on more than one occasion. Despite their fluffy white appearance I can tell you one thing sheep don’t smell great. My memory of the aroma if I try to put it into words is a combination of rancid lanolin must manure and flatulence. The dip itself (used to inoculate the sheep against pests and fungal infections) smells like concentrated bugspray.I think you can see where this is going.Sheep Dip – the whisky – by Spencerfield Spirits (now owned by Ian Macleod Distillers Limited) is a blend of 16 single malt whiskies purportedly between the ages of 8 and 20 (although there is no “8” on the bottle) all aged in first-fill ex-bourbon casks. Famed blender Richard “The Nose” Paterson is said to be behind or involved in the blending. It’s bottled at 40% ABV and retails on the low end of the market for malts around $35 – $40 US. The name is actually related to actual sheep dip and refers to a moonshining practice in England whereby illicit distillers would disguise barrels of unreported whisky as barrels of sheep dip. The company also sells a blended scotch named – appropriately enough – Pig’s Nose and another blended malt called The Feathery.My first thought upon seeing the name was how common it seems to be to draw associations between whisky and animals but I’m a fan of Monkey Shoulder which sounds even weirder so… why not?Nose Astringent note of lemon furniture polish assaults the nose first with a musty overtone. By God this actually smells like sheep dip (or more likely sheep as my memories of sheep-related smells are in the distant past). No that’s not a good thing. Lanolin (another sheep-related smell) and dry fungal – almost sulfury – malt arrive next. A rest in the glass dissipates these leaving some pretty standard ex-bourbon notes of light caramel nougat honey and vanilla.Palate Thin-bodied. Sweet malty notes of caramel and toffee join black licorice and root beer after a short tongue burn.Finish Short. Licorice again and a fading bitterness including some oaky mouth-drying tannins. Fades without much else.With Water A few drops of water make the licorice/anise note more piercing now smelling more like cardamom. Other than that no change except for a slightly sweeter root beer note on the finish. I don’t see a reason to bother with water for this dram.Overall Boy howdy those are some awful notes fresh out of the bottle. I highly recommend letting this one sit for a bit before getting it anywhere near your olfactory senses. Once you do though you risk being thoroughly bored by this mediocre-at-best assortment of ex-bourbon malts. I can find nothing to recommend this particular blended malt and the sheep association in the name does it no favors monkeys grouse turkeys dogs and foxes notwithstanding.
373,SIA Blended Scotch - Here’s something new A blended scotch whisky will soon be launched after being successfully funded on crowdsourced startup birthplace Kickstarter. Kickstarter is known for funding tech startups video games and gadgets. San Francisco resident Carin Castillo has successfully leveraged the service to fully fund (and then some) her dream of releasing her own blended scotch whisky. Alas the Kickstarter campaign has ended but you can still look forward to the imminent product release in late February 2013.Carin was kind enough to send me a tasting sample. I’m always in favor of supporting local businesses and especially independent producers that challenge the entrenched factory mentality of big blends like Johnnie Walker. SIA packaged in an attractive 750ml bottle and at an equally attractive 43% ABV contains Carin’s own blend of malts from “Highland Speyside and a touch of Islay” with an undisclosed proportion of Scottish grain whisky. It was all distilled aged and bottled in Scotland qualifying it for the label “blended scotch whisky”. Let’s see how it tastes.Nose Honeysuckle lavender sprouted grains. Soft. Some light toffee. A bit grainy – a touch heavy-handed with the youngish grain? After a rest in the glass there is a dose of crushed vanilla bean and the stuff in the center of Cadbury Creme Eggs.Palate Awesome creamy mouthfeel. Milky and very very soft. A feather-light alcohol burn (although overused the word ‘smooth’ comes unbidden to mind). More sweet caramelized sugars vanilla crème brûlée and a little vodka.Finish Medium-long. Malted milk balls. Fades with marshmallow apple juice walnut skins and marzipan.With Water Water brings more vanilla cake frosting to the nose but flattens out the rest. If anything it makes the palate sweeter – Mexican wedding cookies? I would say you can take or leave the water with this one. It certainly will support mixing in cocktails especially at this proof.Overall This reminds me of Great King Street with its soft grains marshmallow and toffee. I think the proportion of younger grain is a bit high which causes a few high notes of vodka (not bad enough to call them ‘paint thinner’) but the blender’s touch is more apparent here than in many mass-market blends (Johnnie Walker comes to mind) and I’d far rather support this concept of blended scotch than the produce of big soulless factories. I don’t taste the addition of peated malt so maybe the ‘touch of Islay’ comes from Bunnahabhain (which would explain the walnut skins). This is certainly good enough to drink unmixed and un-iced and will do very well in cocktails.Carin has not announced a price point yet so it’s hard for me to give a solid recommendation. I believe products targeted at the low-to-mid-level spirits market live and die by their price points. My rough estimation is that SIA would be a very good deal at $35 a bottle although my valuation system appears wildly out-of-date considering recent across-the-board price hikes. At any rate your money is better spent on a product from a passionate small-business venture like SIA than on yet another bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label. Go SIA!
374,Smokehead - From the same producer as Isle of Skye this single-malt from an unspecified Islay distillery brings up a few observations I’ve been mulling about the branding of whisky. Barrels of single malt can find themselves in various places outside of the distillery’s own bottling plant. Many end up in the hands of blenders who use them as flavoring elements in branded blends like Cutty Sark and The Famous Grouse or include them in all-malt vattings such as those released by Wemyss Malts and Compass Box. Some are chosen by independent bottlers to release under their own labels (sometimes even with extra aging or finishing in other barrels). These include the likes of Gordon & MacPhail Berry Brothers & Rudd Whyte & Mackay and even the Single-Malt Whisky Society (SMWS). Finally some are chosen to represent entirely different brands with the original distillery’s identity hidden. Examples of this are Finlaggan Trader Joes’ own Highland Single-Malt and Ian Macleod’s Smokehead.For me this begs a question what exactly are you paying for when you buy such a product as this? You aren’t told the distillery from which it came nor (usually) the age. You’re asked to trust in the “brand” which is really nothing more than a careful selection of barrels which approximate the same style – usually a style that deviates from the distillery norm. If we guess that Smokehead for example is young Ardbeg and that the barrels were not kept for use by the distillery due to their milder peat ppm or divergent notes of pine sap fish sauce and mint then we are allowing Smokehead to establish its brand on that flavor profile. A consumer’s reason for buying such a product then must be either a preference for those flavors over the distillery standard or the desire to pay a lower price. Or perhaps a clever marketing campaign that hoodwinks consumers into believing that Smokehead is better at picking Ardbeg barrels than Ardbeg is.For me the only reason that compels me to buy products like this is price. In fact I do often keep a bottle of Finlaggan on hand due to its absurdly low price. I’m willing to accept slightly sub-par barrels of unknown Islay whisky in exchange for a bargain price. Smokehead on the other hand is $53 a bottle. Is it good enough to command such a price?Nose Dark musty grimy smoke. Oily. Some suggestion of pine sap. Warm charcoal notes and a tiny bit of dark chocolate.Palate Heavy barrel char and oaky resin to the point of being woody. Smoke comes in with barbeque sauce Thai fish sauce and hickory.Finish A hint of mint but only of medium length (surprising for an Islay). Not particularly bitter which is nice but fades with a lot of woodiness.Overall A mediocre dram when compared with similar young Islays. There is some nice dark musty peat but it’s not as intense as most Islay fans would like. My best guess is that this is a 6 year-old Ardbeg from a heavily charred ex-bourbon barrel but not an excellent one. Someone suggested it might be Lagavulin. If so it would have to be older – 9 years? – to account for those dark musty notes. However I just don’t find that Lagavulin sweet-smoke balance here. Would I buy a 6 year-old Ardbeg distillery bottling for $53? No and I wouldn’t buy this either.
375,Smooth Ambler Old Scout American Whiskey - Smooth Ambler is a West Virginia distillery founded in 2009 that like so many other upstart distilleries lately initially turned to sourcing and relabelling whiskey while waiting for its own new-make spirit to age. Like High West Smooth Ambler has chosen the route of creative blending to add value and individuality to these sourced whiskies. The Old Scout and Contradiction bottlings are both examples of this and the website is very transparent about where these whiskies were (not) made stopping just short of offering the actual distillery names. Big Level Bourbon is Smooth Ambler’s first 100% in-house-distilled mature bourbon and I look forward to tasting it.Smooth Ambler Old Scout not only has an awkward name it has an awkward composition A “union” of two sourced American whiskeys blended in “hand-selected batches” that prevents the whiskey from being labelled as “bourbon”. The first whiskey is an MGP-distilled 36% rye (“high-rye”) 9 year-old bourbon. The second is a Tennessee-distilled whiskey made from a bourbon mash which is aged for 5 years in re-charred used ex-bourbon barrels. This use of refill casks although prevalent in Scotland and for many other styles of whisky across the world makes the entire vatting ineligible for a “bourbon” label. I couldn’t find reliable information on the source of the Tennessee whiskey although I’m inclined to think that it’s Dickel.The resulting American Whiskey is bottled without chill filtration at the oddly-chosen 49.5% ABV and retails for $30 or so. My bottle is from batch #22.Nose Antiseptic up front with high notes of mango tutti-frutti and “0% fruit juice” bottled fruit punch. A rest in the glass dissipates those antiseptic notes leaving a nose-piercingly tart assortment of energetic fruits. The 99 proof strength does come through so don’t stick your nose too far in the glass.Palate Thin body (strange for a “bourbon”). More fruit punch with some corn syrup sweetness and processed candy flavors. Plastic-y.Finish Medium-long. Warming. Echoes of the omnipresent fruit faint wood and a tinge of menthol/mint at the end.With Water Several drops of water have little effect on the aroma. The water adds a little much-needed balance in the mouth with a little more oaky/caramel sweetness and a suggestion of rye spices. Water is not needed here but doesn’t hurt anything.Overall Uhh. What probably started out as decent 9 year-old MGP bourbon is ruined by the fake-fruit overly-young Tennessee whiskey. I don’t care that a rejuvenated cask was used nor do I care about the lack of a “bourbon” label. I care about too-young whiskey being blended into a product to spread out stock or lower its price… especially when that price is still nosing above the magical $30 level. I’ve tasted $15 whiskey that was around the same flavor profile as this. Here’s hoping that the whiskey distilled in-house is much better.
376,Sonoma County Distilling Co. Cask Strength Bourbon No. 2 - I don’t know if I’ve become some kind of jaded whisky snob (From Noob to Snob The Scotch Noob Memoirs… it practically writes itself!) but every time I choose a bottle of mass-market bourbon off of the shelf I open it with a sense of hope (am I discovering a new hidden gem?) that quickly turns to disappointment. In contrast whenever I find myself faced with a glass of $80-a-bottle craft American whiskey from a “distiller” I’ve never heard of I approach it with a sense of apprehension. Imagine my joy and consternation then when I discovered a new hidden gem in a craft whiskey from a distiller I’ve never heard of! You may have read my review of Sonoma County Distilling Company’s Rye which is phenomenal. I also got to try a sample of their “West of Kentucky” Bourbon No. 2 a wheater bottled at cask strength.Sonoma County Distilling located in Rohnert Park CA and opened in 2010 uses direct-fired copper alembic pot stills for its whiskies which are twice-distilled (like most single-malt scotches which are also distilled in pot stills). The West of Kentucky Bourbon No. 2 has a mashbill of Midwest yellow corn unmalted Canadian wheat and malted barley from Wyoming. The whiskey is aged for one year (it is thus not “straight” bourbon whiskey) in new charred American oak and bottled without chill filtration at a reasonably low cask strength of 53.8%. I tasted bottle #26 from batch #4 which produced only 40 cases and was bottled in September of 2016. The distillery appears to release the cask-strength editions of their bourbons on a rotating limited basis. This bottle retailed at $65.Note that Sonoma’s Bourbons come in three recipes No. 1 is made with cherrywood-smoked barley No. 2 is wheated and No. 3 is high-rye.Nose Yuge! Big aromas of oily grassy farm-distilled whiskey. You can almost smell the big clanky greasy alembic still. Rough but complex and challenging. As a wheated whiskey the aroma skews towards molasses and green grass (a young high-rye whiskey would skew towards pine/eucalyptus) but there are unusual notes of resin tobacco and cocoa nibs. Obviously young but characterful and interesting.Palate A wave of weird-but-good flavors greet the tongue Chocolate. Coffee. A grassiness verging on peat. Banana. Then the 53% ABV burns a layer of skin off of the tongue. After the tears clear individual notes of green grass raw sugar cane and ripe banana dominate.Finish Medium-short. A bit muddy. Dry. Oaky tannins dry the walls of the mouth but no individual notes are distinguishable.With Water Several drops of water add a licorice note to the aroma but tone down the other oily/industrial notes leaving the grassy ones. The palate is less fiery (slightly). Very slightly. Ok it still hurts. Water optional here – I don’t think it adds anything of particular value but you might desire to water it down to a more tolerable drinking proof. I won’t judge.Overall This reminds me a lot of Tom’s Foolery but with wheat-flavored elements instead of piney rye. It tastes rough and handmade but also fearless of big flavors. I would drink this now but I’d also keep an eye on the distillery – if they polish their methods and add a little age this could be a big contender for the new era of top-tier American whiskies.
377,Sonoma County Distilling Co. Cask Strength Cherrywood Rye - You might remember that I toured the Sonoma County Distillery in Rohnert Park CA earlier this year. I reviewed the distillery’s “No. 2” Bourbon as well as one of their single barrel ryes. The only bottle that I purchased while there was the unique Cherrywood Rye at cask strength which is a reasonable $65 (reasonable for a cask-strength “craft” rye). It’s young “No less than 1 year” which you can take to mean it’s 1 year old and it’s aged in new charred American oak and bottled at 54.7% ABV without chill filtration or added coloring.What makes this unique is that the unmalted Canadian rye (about 80% of the mashbill) and unmalted Canadian wheat (the distillery is working towards sourcing local grains) is distilled with a portion of malted barley from Wyoming that has been smoked with California cherry wood. This is a concerted effort by the distiller to create the effect of a barrel-aged Manhattan without using any additives (wine bitters etc.). The distillery uses alembic copper pot stills and double-distills its whiskies.My bottle is from Batch no. 5 which produced 80 cases and was bottled in February of 2017. By the way the distillery recently discontinued its “club” program in order to expand distribution so you might begin seeing their juice outside of local markets.Nose As a young rye I expect grassiness and mint eucalyptus or pine notes. There is grassiness but instead of pine I get a mild woodsmoke cherry blossoms (ahh the power of suggestion) heavy oak and maraschino cherries. Potent but not especially hot. There is also the required assortment of spices – mostly cinnamon here. Palate Thin body. Tart cherries up front followed by a heavy tongue burn. I can’t tell if the smoke is from the cherrywood or from my singed tastebuds but smoke there is. Oaky tannins vanilla cherry syrup and herbal grassiness (now there’s eucalyptus).Finish Medium-long. Some elements of cocktail bitters appear – bitter cherry and medicinal herbs – and burnt sugar or molasses. It does indeed taste somewhat like a high-proof smoked Manhattan.With Water A splash of water adds sooty smoke to the aroma dulls the burn on the palate (a little) and maybe provides a touch more fruit on the tongue and finish. Water does not hurt but if you paid for cask strength you should at least try it at cask strength first.Overall A success. Unlike some fruitwood-smoked whiskies this one is both heavily influenced by the cherrywood smoke and also fully in balance with it. The typical “young rye” grassy notes are present but very understated the barrel proof provides just the right amount of oak and the Manhattan-esque flavors feel emergent not forced. There are a few rough edges and I can’t help but wish for another two or three years in oak but I’m happy with the purchase and looking forward from more from the distillery.
378,Sonoma County Distilling Co. Single Barrel Rye - I love a good local distillery so I’m just going to jump in with both feet on this one. I tasted Sonoma County Distilling Company’s first rye release (a single barrel of straight rye whiskey bottled in 375ml bottles) and its cask-strength bourbon (review here). Right out of the gate the rye blew me away. THIS is their first attempt at a rye?! At the risk of spoiling the below tasting notes (which none of you read anyway admit it) this guy has the round soft sweet new-oak aroma of Cut Spike with the airy piney flavors of a good young craft rye. This plus bottling at cask strength and a “straight” designation (2 years of age if they’re not cheating the TTB) makes for a very solid bottle. At $50 for 375ml it’s squarely in the “pay for craft” sector but I’m hugely in favor of paying $50 for 375ml over $100 for 750ml. Note that most of the company’s other releases are in the $50 – $65 range for full-size bottles.Sonoma County Distilling located in Rohnert Park CA and opened in 2010 uses direct-fired copper alembic pot stills for its whiskies which are twice-distilled (like most single-malt scotches which are also distilled in pot stills). The 100% rye in the mashbill is a combination of unmalted Canadian rye and malted rye from the UK. The whiskey is aged in new charred American oak and bottled at a reasonably low cask strength of 53.7% at least it was for this single-barrel release. I tasted bottle #009 from barrel 14-0129 which produced only 25 cases and was bottled in December of 2016.Nose Sweet! fudgy (maple fudge or blonde fudge). Round and not overtly “rye”… in other words there is no heavy vegetal pine or eucalyptus element and the soft sweet notes take center stage. At cask strength the aroma is strong and decadent with no detracting qualities at all. Reminds me of all of the things I love about Cut Spike but with a straight rye. Excellent.Palate Thin body. Ahh! There’s the pine. It’s nicely balanced against caraway lightly-sweet new oak (vanilla brown sugar) and sweet cream. The tongue burn is intense. After it subsides notes of juniper hazelnut rose water and nougat pervade.Finish Long. Some elements from the aroma return (maple fudge) as well as from the palate (nougat). This fades without bitterness.With Water A couple of drops of water reveal more vegetal (pine/juniper) notes in the aroma. The tongue burn is lessened however and may be a tad sweeter. Water is optional with this one.Overall I’m very curious if the successes of this rye translate to the regular batched versions of the distillery’s ryes or if this particular cask was stand-out. The fudgey round flawless façade of the aroma contrasts nicely with the grain-forward-but-complex flavors on the tongue. The finish is basic but doesn’t detract. Overall this is a highly successful craft rye for a highly craft price. If you live in the area or plan to visit Sonoma at least visit the distillery.
379,Sons of Liberty: Battle Cry - It’s an exciting time in the American craft spirits movement. It seems like every day a new distillery pops up on the map making serious young whiskey with an American twist. A trend among these new distilleries seems to be the use of malted barley (thus making a single-malt in the Scottish style) but aging exclusively in new charred American oak barrels like bourbon but for very little time (often under 2 years). Cut Spike is a prime example of the success of this approach as are Westland and Balcones among others.I was sent tasting samples of two single-malt American Whiskies (and a third Hop-flavored whiskey review upcoming!) by Jake at DPA (Thanks Jake!) from Rhode Island craft distillery Sons of Liberty. Sons of Liberty is taking the above formula and adding yet another craft twist they’re using their experience as brewers to brew tasty beer in various styles to use as the wash for their whiskies. It makes sense really as beer is made primarily of malted barley and the American craft beer scene is booming even bigger than the craft whiskey one. The wash (fermented malt and water) used at most malt whisky distilleries is not something you’d want to drink a full-dry (alcoholic without sweetness) flat bland warm beer-like liquid with dead yeast cells floating in it. Also since most whisky is made from the same strain of distiller’s yeast and the same high-yield strain of barley this wash would also be largely the same at each malt distillery. Instead Sons of Liberty is brewing tasty stouts and belgian-style beers to distill into their equally tasty malt whiskies. To prove it Jake included a 12 oz bottle of the wash (slightly carbonated) from each of their two main whiskies!Battle Cry is an American single malt whiskey distilled from a Belgian Trappist-style beer (using Trappist Yeast) made with 20% rye malt and the rest Pale and Honey malts. The beer is then double-distilled in Sons of Liberty’s 250 gallon pot still and aged for under two years in new charred American oak barrels that are “enhanced” with lightly toasted staves of French Oak (something they probably learned from Compass Box’s John Glaser). They use both 10 and 30 gallon barrels probably to accelerate the oak influence (smaller barrels transfer oaky flavors more quickly than larger ones). The whiskey is then bottled at 40% ABV without chill filtration or added coloring.My 375ml tasting bottle was bottle #840 from batch #8.Nose Honey-sweet with milk chocolate oatmeal cookies and heavy oaky vanilla. There are bourbon-like charcoal notes but the balance is between malty cereal notes (like a Speyside single malt) and big oak-derived aromas.Palate Heavy bodied with a few nutty flavors (toasted almonds) and more malty grains. Some marshmallow and a heavy dose of oaky tannins. A bit of clove. Very bourbon-like.Finish Medium-long. Candy-corn (honey) toasted oats stale spices (clove nutmeg) fading with marshmallow and a dark cacao nibs.With Water A few drops of water wake up some vegetal notes – menthol or eucalyptus primarily – making this suddenly smell like a young straight rye. The palate is a little thinner but the finish is more lively and almost has a bare hint of tropical fruit (green banana). A little water’s not a bad idea with this one.Overall This drinks like liquid oatmeal cookies. A nice balance of clear-cut cereal grains with (almost) heavy-handed new oak. Like most American single-malts this is more like bourbon than scotch certainly because of the use of new charred oak. That said this one stands out in the crowd due to its spot-on cereal notes which could be because of the attention paid to the wort/wash. Currently Sons of Liberty products are only available in the US Northeast. Here’s hoping their distribution becomes wider!Bonus Wash tasting.It’s not often short of a distillery tour that you get to taste a whiskey’s wash alongside the distilled and aged final product. I’ve certainly never been able to do it. Battle Cry’s wash is lightly carbonated (a courtesy since the actual fermented wort would be flat) and is heavy with Trappist yeast notes of sour grapes citrus peels and honey. The beer is thicker and heavier than I anticipated but it is yeasty in that Belgian style. Interesting that the yeast-specific fruit notes do not make it into the whiskey whereas the 20% malted rye is undetectable in the beer but very influential in the whiskey! I enjoyed the beer so much that I savored the rest of it while watching a movie.I am SO curious what a boilermaker with Battle Cry wort and a shot of Battle Cry whiskey would taste like… Also check my review of Uprising from Sons of Liberty a single-malt American whisky made from stout!
380,Sons of Liberty: Hop Flavored Whiskey (Seasonal) - My stance in general on flavored whisky is that if sugar is involved I stay away from it. I also generally don’t review them since their purpose is usually to “enhance” cocktails with specific flavors or to provide sugar to ease the burn of whisky when taken as a shot. Really this stance is hard to defend since in essence all whisky is “flavored” by oak – or by compounds that are extracted by the high-proof alcohol over time including wood sugars. Going one step further many of my favorite whiskies are “flavored” by the sherry or other (sweet) contents left behind in newly-dumped barrels that are then used to age whisky. It shouldn’t be surprising that scotch is allowed by law to have a certain small amount of sherry or other wine mixed into it (specifically whatever is still sloshing around the bottom of a recently-dumped wine cask). This sherry can even be ADDED to a dry cask to “season” it before the whisky goes in. It’s tough to stand on some kind of moral high ground and claim that sherry added to whisky is OK but cinnamon syrup is not.Still I stand by my prejudices even if I can’t defend them.Here’s an interesting exception. Rather than adding hop-flavored sugar syrup mixed up in some lab which is what Hiram Walker and its ilk would do Sons of Liberty set out to create a whiskey that evoked refreshing summertime IPA beer by actually distilling an IPA beer wash suspending hops in a gin basket during pot-still distillation and then dry-hopping the finished (aged) whiskey! No sugar syrup no weird chemicals just artisanal ingredients treated with respect and the creative use of traditional brewing and distilling methods to craft something innovative. I can bend my indefensible position on flavored whiskies for that.Sons of Liberty’s Hop Flavored Whiskey is a seasonal release (they also have a Pumpkin one). Distilled from an IPA (India Pale Ale) wash and then distilled with a gin basket hung in the pot still containing Cascade and Centennial hops. The resulting “whiskey” (or malt gin?) is aged for less than 2 years in American oak and then dry-hopped with Citra and Sorachi Ace hops before bottling at 40% ABV.Batch #3 Bottle #447Nose Piercing notes of grapefuit juice pine sap and orange peel. Very perfumed with fruits and florals in dizzying number. Not particularly bitter (yet) but very strongly reminiscent of the scent of a freshly-poured draft IPA. The whisky notes are overshadowed by the hops but there is a biscuity fruitcake-like depth to the aroma.Palate Sweet. Medium-bodied with hops notes that are at first strongly bitter and then calm down and become familiar – pine resin lemon peel. There is a slight undercurrent of pale malt and vanilla but as an afterthought.Finish On the short side. Surprisingly not bitter. Some of the fruit notes linger becoming jammy. Fades with pine lemon.With Water Oddly a few drops of water seem to mute the hop notes leaving not a whole lot behind. I would definitely not add any water to this. Out of curiosity I tried a dram of this on ice and found the same thing – the hop notes are very muted and without them there isn’t much else going on. I would either drink this neat or use it to create a subtly hop-infused whiskey cocktail.Overall There is no question that the hop character is fully and prominently displayed with all of the full range of hop-derived flavors and aromas but amplified and carried by the alcohol to the point that the whiskey itself is little more than a vehicle for the distilled concentrated essence of IPA. Surely this was the point and it’s one of the more successful flavored whiskies I’ve tasted. I’m very glad that the “flavoring” of this whisky is restricted to the use of hops rather than the type of sugar-laden syrup that other flavored whiskies suffer from. I suggest that if you come across a bottle of this and you’re a fan of hoppy beer that you buy it just for the novelty of it. You won’t be disappointed by the quality even if you’re not really sure what to do with a hop-flavored “whiskey”!
381,Sons of Liberty: Uprising - If you haven’t yet read my review of Sons of Liberty’s Battle Cry a very similar American single-malt whiskey made from a Belgian-style beer.I was sent tasting samples of two single-malt American Whiskies (and a third Hop-flavored whiskey review upcoming!) by Jake at DPA (Thanks Jake!) from Rhode Island craft distillery Sons of Liberty. Like Battle Cry Uprising is made from a real beer (a stout) and aged in new charred American oak barrels. I got to sample both the whisky and the wash (see review below).Uprising is an American single malt whiskey distilled from a stout beer using classic American ale yeast and the traditional stout malts Pale Malt Dehusked Chocolate Malt Crystal 45 Biscuit malts and plain roasted barley. The beer is then double-distilled in Sons of Liberty’s 250 gallon pot still and aged for under two years in new charred American oak barrels that are “enhanced” with lightly toasted staves of French Oak (something they probably learned from Compass Box’s John Glaser). They use both 10 and 30 gallon barrels probably to accelerate the oak influence (smaller barrels transfer oaky flavors more quickly than larger ones). The whiskey is then bottled at 40% ABV without chill filtration or added coloring.My 375ml tasting bottle was bottle #662 from batch #7.Nose Drier than Battle Cry with a brooding bitter dark chocolate note dark roasted coffee chocolate-covered cherries but with less clarity in the cereal notes which are limited to a hint of over-toasted bread.Palate Thick bodied. Again heavy roasty notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Heavy dark bread (pumpernickel). Dusty. Toasted walnuts. After awhile there’s a note of cinnamon and vanilla like Mexican-style hot chocolate.Finish Medium-short. Crunchy dark chocolate-covered coffee beans and a slight bitterness like strong brewed coffee. Fades quickly.With Water A few drops of water seem not to affect the aroma but thin the palate. As with Battle Cry the finish is a bit livelier with a hint of that cherry coming through but I wouldn’t bother with water with this one.Overall This is good but not quite as successful (for me) as Battle Cry which is better balanced. That said Uprising is true to its roots with very clear roasty notes of coffee and dark chocolate just like you’d expect in a stout beer. There is not quite enough sweetness to balance the bitter nor quite enough malty cereal notes or fruit to balance the heavy toast of the malt. I’m also missing the new oak which is probably hiding beneath those coffee notes.Bonus Wash Tasting.Surprisingly fruity with a core of strawberry jam and cordial cherries. On top a foamy froth of creamy latte and mocha. Not oppressively heavy despite being a stout beer. On the finish the bitter roast malt notes come to the fore with those dark-roast coffee and baking chocolate flavors. The “chocolate-covered cherry” notes and the coffee definitely translate to the whisky although I think that the Uprising single malt would be more successful if more of the fruit and sweet malt notes had survived distillation.
382,Speyburn (10 year) - Quick on the heels of my Bradan Orach review I received a sample of Speyburn 10 to compare. The bottom-dollar category is an odd one for a reviewer. Can I pan it because it doesn’t compare favorably with standards like The Balvenie DoubleWood or Glenfiddich 15? Not really it’s almost half the price of those bottles. I could lift it up as a paragon of drinkable whisky for almost no money but then readers might mistake that for a wholehearted endorsement of the quality of the whisky and go buy a case.In the interest of skirting this issue here are my thoughts. Speyburn 10 aged in ex-bourbon barrels and bottled at a respectable 43% ABV is better than the younger NAS Bradan Orach. It costs about $3 to $5 more ($20 at BevMo here in California) and is better suited to sipping than any other $20 whisky I’ve tasted. Bradan Orach becomes more of a mixer after your first glass or two but Speyburn 10 manages to straddle the line between “cheap” and “worth drinking straight”. It’s lightly floral and has no outstanding positive (or negative) characteristics. You should buy it if you feel guilty drinking $40 whisky but don’t enjoy blends neat. It’s also worth the extra $5 over Bradan Orach. However it simply isn’t going to satisfy like a $40 or $60 whisky especially if you’re accustomed to sherry finishes or Nose Yeasty. A sour note – like young white wine. A hefty dose of vanilla. More character than the younger Bradan Orach. After a rest in the glass it becomes more overtly floral.Palate Creamy texture. A wave of vanilla bean up front subsiding to reveal soft grains sugar cookies and… well that’s it.Finish Short. The wine flavor returns – here grape skins – with a slight tannic quality. Not particularly bitter but there is a dry “vodka-esque” note on the fade-out.With Water A few drops of water draw out a little sweetness in the nose and a larger dose of florals. The mouthfeel suffers a little but that sweetness continues on through the finish. A few drops of water are a good idea with this dram.Overall This is a step up from the NAS release Bradan Orach in both potency and quality. There’s nothing here to warrant recommending this bottle over any other similar Highland malt which sounds like a criticism except that Speyburn is wisely priced to compete not against other better single malts but instead against inexpensive – and abrasive – blends. While it could be argued that some of the better $20 blends are superior it’s impossible to argue that this isn’t a great value. If you’re trying to decide between Speyburn 10 and Bradan Orach know that for $3 to $5 more the 10-year is about 50% better. Also Speyburn nice move bottling this at 43% ABV. That extra potency shows.
383,Speyburn Bradan Orach - Speyburn at first glance on the “cheap” section of the whisky shelf seems like one of those fake “distilleries” that is actually independently bottled from a secret source. It’s not. The Speyburn distillery sometimes cited as the “most photographed distillery in Scotland” for its picturesque location and quaint 1900s architecture has been in mostly continuous operation (albeit on only a pair of stills) since its construction in 1897. I was struck not by the blindingly shiny gold label nor the declaration of a “Highland Single Malt” which is “wonderfully balanced and full-bodied with a long-lasting finish” (who doesn’t say that?). No I was struck by the price. This NAS bottling (named using the Scots Gaelic for Golden Salmon after the excellent Salmon fishing on Granty Burn the distillery’s water source) was $15 at Trader Joe’s in California. Considering the competition at that price point it either has to be acrid and undrinkable or bland and uninteresting right? I bought a bottle.There aren’t many details about the makeup of Bradan Orach on Speyburn’s website. It’s matured exclusively in ex-bourbon casks. It’s a vatting of different ages (probably considering the lack of an age statement) likely most younger than 10 years old. After tasting it I’d venture a guess that the average age is around 6. And it’s unthinkably cheap for a single-malt at $15. The distillery’s 10 year-old is also light on the wallet at around $22. Expect a review of that one soon.Nose Malty caramel and a distinct green apple note. A tad yeasty. There is no denying the youth of this vatting from the aroma but the effect is not off-putting or overly harsh. Deeper in there is a hint of vanilla. After a rest in the glass the nose gets a little thin.Palate Thin body – almost watery. Moderate tongue burn. Sour apple unripe cherries sugar cookie and a slight tannic woodiness. The flavors are skewed towards the sour in an “unripe” way. Alas too dry to be well-balanced.Finish Short. Sparse but slightly sweet like a touch of honey in green tea. Not bitter but there is a fading sense of grassiness.With Water A few drops of water release a ghost of barley grains on the nose and add ever so little sweetness on the tongue. Unfortunately you pay for it with a distinct acetone note on the finish. Euchh.Overall The nose is gentle and expressive for such an undoubtedly young vatting. The body and finish don’t quite live up to the promise. A bit more sweetness or roundness on the palate would warrant a higher rating although it would probably be more expensive if that were the case. It’s pretty hard to pass judgement on a $15 whisky. It’s certainly not bad and is almost (almost) as good as the relatively pricier Glenfiddich 12. If you really want a bottom-dollar sipper that can serve double-duty in cocktails Bradan Orach isn’t going to disappoint. I just made a pretty passable Rob Roy with it. Just don’t expect it to taste like a $40 single malt. It doesn’t.I rated this “Recommended” because I don’t have a rating for “Buy it if you’re looking for the cheapest possible drinkable whisky”. I have it on good authority though that the 10-year is better and only $5 more. More to come on that.
384,"Springbank (10 year) - (See my review of the 100-proof version of Springbank 10 year here).
Nose Oily non-smoky peat hints of tar and woodchar spicy and mossy. Salt breeze almost savory like the air outside a Teriyaki joint. A dash of water brings out a lot of barleywine and fresh fruit scents dulling some of the peat.Flavor starts with smoked meats vanilla big wet earthy peat but no campfire. Saltiness continues with mid-palate cerealy sweetness… Complex and spicy a bit vegetal. Water brings out a sweetness like refined white sugar but covers up some of the eccentric meaty flavors. Definitely savory.Finish is long and complicated more spices salted fish boggy peat. Evolves as it fades.Summary This is eccentric and nuanced challenging and satisfying. Great stuff – I can’t wait to come back and discover more!Update 8/6/2018 I published an updated review of this whisky here.Note Noticed some black particles swirling around the glass (which I purchased at a bar). At the time I guessed barrel char that had escaped through the barrier filtering process. When I asked on twitter I got the following response from @Springbank1828“More than likely is barrel char. Sometimes these wee bits manage to escape through the filter so it isn’t unheard of.”Thanks mates!
Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly. The distillery uses traditional worm tubs a cast-iron mash tun and employs mechanical ‘rummagers’ (to prevent a buildup of burnt deposits) in the copper stills which are heated with a combination of steam and direct oil fire. Springbank uses three stills to create a 2.8-time (not triple) distillation. Now hold on because this math is tricky The first “wash” distillation produces so-called “low wines” which are around 20% alcohol. A second distillation produces an intermediate distillate which is in the neighborhood of 35% alcohol. A third still is charged with a solution of 80% of this double-distillate and 20% of the “low wines” and a third distillation is performed. Thus in the final spirit around 80% of the volume has been triple-distilled while around 20% of the volume has been double-distilled. Hence 2.8x distillation. Phew! For a fantastic and in-depth guided tour of Springbank distillery be sure to check out Ralfy’s visit (scroll down).Springbank also makes Longrow (a peated malt) and (new in 2006) Hazelburn (unpeated truly triple-distilled). These along with the distillery’s flagship Springbank bottlings are all non-chill-filtered have no caramel coloring and are reduced to bottling strength on-site with the same water used to produce the whisky. The water like all Campbeltown whiskies comes from the Crosshill Loch in the hills above the town and is supplemented by a private well from a borehole drilled deep into the rock beneath the town. Note that the Springbank “CV” bottling which is at a similar price-point is purportedly a vatting of 6 8 and 12 year-old malts (unverified) from different barrel finishes."
385,"Springbank (10 year), Revisited - It has been some time since I last reviewed Springbank 10 year (see my old review here) and since the packaging has changed in the meantime I thought I’d give it another go. I think it’s valuable once in awhile to revisit whiskies from your past. They may have changed true but YOU may also have changed. Tastes evolve as does your perception both subjectively (ability to compare to a wider range of experiences) and objectively (improved ability to interpret sensory inputs).I also now know thanks to a reader that Springbank is in an odd category of single malts products whose US importer heaps on an unreasonable markup. A 700ml bottle of Springbank 10 ran me $46 US after currency exchange rates when ordered from the UK (plus a whole lot in shipping but it was in a large batch of orders so that spread out the cost a bit). A 750ml bottle of the US edition of Springbank 10 runs $69 at my local store. Ordering Springbank specifically from the UK is a no-brainer… 50 fewer milliliters notwithstanding.Springbank 10 is classic stuff. Aged 10 years (It even says it on the bottle! How old-fashioned!) not chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV without artificial coloring. Springbank does things the “old way” and is unapologetic about it. On-site floor maltings worm tubs and even (some) direct-fired stills. They also do a crazy “2.8-time” distillation and the malt is partially peated. Why? Because that’s how they’ve always done it. These days with all of the marketing and media stunts all of the computerization and homogenization and the false grasping at “tradition” and “legacy” as though they were solely corporate buzzwords and not the valuable result of actual time and actual effort it’s nice to be able to enjoy whisky made this way. Here’s hoping it continues to last.Nose Green apple lime juice juicy green pear. Delectable but with limited peat presence.Palate Thin but silky body. Mild tongue burn. Drying vegetal (grassy) tannins with a bit of resinous (piney) peat. The overall impression is still fruity. Some charcoal.Finish A lot of charcoal but not too bitter. Green apple skins. Cucumber water. Fades quickly but lingers with that pine-flecked peat.With Water A few drops of water brighten up the aroma but don’t add anything new. Palate texture is unaffected although the burn is tamed. Water optional.Overall A very tasty mild-peated malt with a surprising amount of fruit. Very well-balanced. I wish other single malts had this kind of balance and quality at 10 years of age.Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly.

386,Springbank (15 year) - Let’s get something out of the way I love Springbank. It’s one of my favorite distilleries. It’s also one of the very few distilleries left in Scotland that embodies the “old school” tradition-laden whiskymaking techniques that marketing departments elsewhere salivate over. Flip through a whisky or wine magazine and you’ll see full-page ad after full-page ad of hardworking bearded men (usually) maneuvering rustic-looking wooden barrels in dirt-floored lichen-walled warehouses or running golden barley through their bare hands or stoking a peat fire in a brick oven. Springbank actually does those things.This can backfire though. Most of the technological improvements in the whisky industry over the past 100 years have been implemented for the sake of consistency in the resulting whisky. Everything from tree-to-warehouse wood management programs and drum maltings to computerized stills and stainless steel washbacks are primarily meant to guarantee a consistent level of quality in the final bottle (and sometimes to cut costs). A distillery that runs without all of these modern crutches is subject to Mother Nature’s whimsy and can produce sublime never-to-be-repeated nectars as well as skunky garbage. Usually somewhere in between. Here we have an example of the latter. This bottle costs $100 in the US where all Springbank Hazelburn and Longrow (all from Springbank distillery) bottles cost about twice what they ought to (a great reason to order from the UK). And yet the sample that I opened is completely riddled with sulfur. I will review it on that basis but know that Springbank 15 from another batch is likely to provide a much better experience. Think of this as a cautionary tale and always buy your whisky from a reputable merchant who will accept returns when this inevitably happens to you.The sulfur by the way is probably from a bad barrel or batch of barrels that previously held sherry. It is common practice with any barrels that contain wine to “candle” them with sulfur candles. The pungent sulfur dioxide gas disinfects the barrel and prevents the growth of bacteria mold and fungi during storage or transportation. Sometimes the lingering sulfur smell penetrates the wood and affects the whisky during maturation. Advanced barrel management and seasoning techniques can weed out or prevent these “bad barrels” but Springbank’s old-world methods carry a higher risk of failure and here we are. The “Avoid” rating reflects this particular bottle but I will make an attempt to find another sample and update this review in the future.Nose Much clearer sherry character than the younger expressions. Here though it is heavily sulfurous – of the “rotten eggs” variety – to the point of distraction. There is some typical sooty Springbank peat and doughy malt behind the sherry but without the stage presence of the 10 year.Palate Thin-bodied. Peat-forward with soot char and jam. Hot for 46%. The sulfur peeks through in places.Finish Earthy with charry peat and lingering mixed fruits (Cherry? Berry jam?). Fades with dried cranberries and vague peat.With Water Water – God help me – only intensifies the sulfur.Overall It’s really hard for me to speak intelligently about this Springbank when the only olfactory memory in my head is that of a composting outhouse I once experienced that smelt strongly of sulfur. You hear of whisky smells transporting you to places and times … that can also work to the detriment of the imbiber it appears as I am transported by this whisky back to that one particular outhouse. This is after hundreds of whiskies the first time I’ve really been affected by sulfur notes in a whisky. This one is bad though. I would return this bottle if I had purchased it for any price.Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly.

387,Springbank 100 Proof (10 year) - (You can see my previous review of the 46% ABV (92 proof) Springbank here). After enjoying the Springbank 10 year I sought out a bottle and found this 100 proof expression instead. It’s very similar (both are partially matured in ex-sherry casks) but a little nuttier a bit creamier fuller body and a little more ‘oomph’ from the slightly higher ABV. If you can find either bottle they’re both worth a try for anyone who likes savory challenging and complex malts. Note that this is a review of the American release of the 100-proof (50% ABV). There is another “100 Proof” bottling at 57% ABV (with exclusively ex-bourbon maturation) which is not available in the U.S. The “100 Proof” bottling listed on the Springbank website is the 57% ABV European version. The 50% ABV American version is not listed. Thanks for making it complicated Springbank. =PNose Roasting meats with a whiff of earthy mushroomy peat. Grassy herbal. Nutty and a little salty. A splash of water brings out the nuttiness – some walnuts and almonds.Palate Full bodied. Creamy. The 100 proof burn is present and intense but gives way to roasted peanuts rotisseried meat salt and light oak. Not at all sweet. Challenging. A splash of water thins the body a little and kills the creaminess.Finish Medium-long and complex with dark chocolate some bitter barrel char almond extract and fading vanilla. A little water intensifies the almond and brings out a surprising little echo of sour cherry and hibiscus.Overall Springbank 100 is challenging and intriguing. I get new flavors every time I drink it. Try it once with water – the interesting flavors on the finish are nice but in my opinion the loss of the creaminess in the body isn’t worth it. I marked this as “Must Try” but of course it’s interchangeable with the 46% ABV version – no real need to try both.Springbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings) while labor-intensive yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly.

388,St. George Single Malt American Whiskey (Lot 10) - These guys (they make Hangar 1 vodka) are up in Alameda CA and they’ve been making this excellent single-malt American whiskey for 10 years now. The Lot 10 bottling which I got to try tonight at K&L’s Wednesday Whisky tastings is going fast and will soon be replaced with a new (and slightly different) Lot 11.St. George makes single Malt from a Sierra Nevada-made wash (beer) which is crafted from malted barley – some beechwood smoked some roasted to ‘chocolate malt’ level. Aged between 4 and 13 years (average 10 years) Lot 10 is vatted from 17 barrels of single malt. It was aged in a combination of first- and second-fill ex-bourbon casks with a proportion of sherry and port casks as well. Each lot is different with a strategic blending using the best combination of components available at the time. The team at St. George tries to aim for “positive inconsistency” (their term) between batches – meaning they maintain a brand style without adhering necessarily to a static flavor profile. This gives them the latitude to experiment while still producing a consistently high-quality whiskey.(Update Lot 17 reviewed here.)Nose Dried mango. Perfumey vanilla and a few assorted botanicals. Juniper berry or pine? Clove and light chocolate or coffee notes. Eclectic but nuanced and not muddied.Palate A wave of chocolate up front with a creamy mouth feel. A clear crisp cereal character emerges showcasing the excellent barley. The various cask influences take second stage to the clarity of the barley flavor. Yum.Finish Medium-length and a bit bourbonny with more vanilla and caramel but a whisper of orange peel and – yay! – no bitterness detected. Trails off with dark chocolate.Overall Very tasty malt unlike anything else in style although it seems similar (to me) to an American rye. The influence of the bourbon casks is clear but the malt character asserts itself continually. A little fruit a little spice and a lot of chocolate make this an intriguing dram with a lot to discover and no obvious faults. If you’d like to support American craft distillation pick up a bottle of the lot 10 before it disappears – there are rumors of a price increase with lot 11 (along with new packaging) to offset the scarcity of older stock and keep pace with demand. Of course the lot 11 will also show more sherry character as it’s vatted from a larger proportion of ex-sherry casks. Decisions!St. George which also makes eaus de vie absinthe and other spirits is located in Alameda CA and provides tours on Saturday and Sunday (but go on Sunday as it’s less crowded).
389,St. George Single Malt American Whiskey (Lot 17) - “‘Twas Christmas Eve and all through the house…”Kidding! I’ve sort of grown out of the “all blog posts near holidays must be themed” phase and into the grumpy curmudgeon blogger phase. There comes a point in a blogger’s “career” (said with a straight face) when he or she realizes that the same “Top 10 Gifts” article from last year will suffice this year by simply removing the year from the title. I did however want to review something special as tomorrow is Christmas after all. So I dug through the nether regions of my whisky cabinet where I keep the “Open Someday for a Special Occasion” bottles and found this gem. I haven’t reviewed one of St. George’s single malts since Lot 10 back in 2011. Back when it was $50 a bottle. The Alameda-based distillery – which is basically my “home team” as far as proximity to a major distillery goes – has gained their confidence and now charges $100 for this annual lot of always-different and always-special single malt.The “Lot” bottlings are released annually around October of each year and conveniently the lot number corresponds to the year of release. Yes yes that means I’m a full year behind on this one and no you will not be able to find it in stores. You can try to snag the 18 though if there’s any left. You can be sure that the quality will be consistent even though the barrel makeup changes somewhat every year. St. George uses two-row barley and blends different roast levels (like a beer brewer would). They also smoke a portion of unroasted barley with beech and alder wood although I would not call the whisky “smoked” at all flavor-wise.The 2017 “Lot 17” bottling was composed of barrels of St. George single malt aged 6 to 8 years and matured or finished in an assortment of casks including ex-bourbon casks from the company’s sourced Breaking & Entering bourbon and dessert wine American and French oak casks. The malt is bottled at 43% ABV.Nose Intensely meltingly sweet and perfumed. It smells exactly like pear drops. A slight herbal quality (anise clove and pine sap) is balanced against elegant fruit and crystallized sugar. A rest in the glass brings tart berries. This is the kind of malt that one could easily spend an evening analyzing for new aromas.Palate Thin body. Kirschwasser cocoa powder and a cornucopia of candied fruits. Delectable.Finish Of medium length. Cherry liqueur again plus lemon verbena black tea bittersweet cocoa and faint green tobacco. Finishes abruptly without evolving.With Water A few drops of water seem to dull the aroma and brings nothing new to the palate. Don’t bother with water here.Overall A distinct and utter pleasure. St. George is adept at using a canvas of familiar-but-mysteriously-different malt and painting a masterpiece of fruits and flowers and sweets through the use of various casks. While it has a number of scotch-like attributes it ends up tasting undeniably of St. George and distinctly non-Scottish. I cannot get over how perfumed the aroma is with a fruit-and-flowers intensity that I rarely encounter in a whisky of any nationality.St. George “Lot” releases continue to increase in quality and alas in price. I will mark this a “Must Try” although that applies generally to any St. George single malt release. If you’ve already experienced a previous lot this one is simply Recommended (with reservations due to the high price). Grudgingly though I must admit that this malt is worth the price tag.St. George which also makes eaus de vie absinthe and other spirits is located in Alameda CA and provides tours on Saturday and Sunday (but go on Sunday as it’s less crowded).Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
390,Stagg Jr. Batch #9 - I learned about Buffalo Trace’s Stagg Jr. through an unlikely comparison – to its Buffalo Trace Antique Collection sibling George T. Stagg which is basically a 15 year-old version of the same and also bottled at barrel proof. As anyone who has tried to secure any bottle from BTAC knows George T. Stagg is not easy to lay hands on. Indeed this is true of nearly all 15 year-old bourbons these days. I realized after years of failing to acquire any BTAC (except this one) that I might as well sample the lesser-but-more-available expressions from Buffalo Trace. I especially enjoy Eagle Rare 10 without ever having tasted the BTAC 18.Stagg Jr. is an uncut and unfiltered barrel proof Kentucky straight bourbon. My bottle is 65.95% and does not indicate a batch number. The label code suggests that it was bottled in 2017 and the Internet tells me this is batch #9. There is also no age statement although the prose on the back states that it has aged “nearly a decade”. The first batch released in 2013 was a vatting of 8 and 9 year-old bourbon. Other Internet sources suggest 7 years so it’s somewhere between 7 and 9. Stagg shares its “low rye” (under 10% rye) mash bill with Eagle Rare George T. Stagg and the eponymous Buffalo Trace bourbon. Stagg Jr. is bottled at barrel proof which varies from batch to batch.It should be noted that significant batch variations exist to the degree that certain batches have wildly different reviewer scores. If you’re on the fence about a bottle of Stagg Jr. try identifying the batch (search the Web for the exact proof) and then look for reviews of that specific batch.Nose Plum wine and cherry jam. Chewy dark chocolate-covered cherries and fruit tape. Deep dark resinous dried fruit to the degree that I went and searched the Web to see if it was sherried (it’s not). There is also a hearty oak presence some mild spices and a thick foundation of sweet syrupy corn. Nose tickle is pronounced but not overwhelming. Flat-out excellence.Palate Thin body. Burns like vengeance. Burns like a woman’s scorn. Burns like a solar coronal mass ejection. What’s left of my taste buds emerge battle-scarred veterans to detect cherry juice pomegranate and antique oak furniture polish.Finish Long. More fruit but masked by a hazy wood smoke. A little drier now with cocoa nibs and coffee grounds. Fades with bittersweet chocolate and a tinge of salted caramels.With Water Oh God yes give me water. A hearty splash of water initially mutes the aroma and then reveals a little peanut butter and chocolate. My mouth still burns like Old Testament fire and brimstone… consider that you would need to drown this in water to get it anywhere near an easily-drinkable 50% ABV.Overall Holy Hand Grenade this is a bourbon for the ages. Everything I like about bourbon – big wood big fruit big spices – served up at a white-hot 65.95% ABV. I have exactly no bad things to say about this bourbon except that I am physically unable to fill my cabinet with bottles of it due to limited inventory and the next batch may or may not meet my now-lofty expectations. This is definitely a challenge to drink and fits the classical definition of “too hot”. If avoiding alcohol burn is high on your list you should probably avoid this one (just like Booker’s). If the challenge appeals to you and you’re a fan of big flavorful bourbons then this is a Must Try.
391,Starward Nova Single Malt - Despite the burgeoning whisky scene in Australia Tasmania and New Zealand there just aren’t that many bottles here on the shelves in the US. The whiskies that do make it here from entirely the other side of the globe are marked up so high they can’t realistically compete with whiskies made closer to home or at industrial scale from established brands. The whisky scene Down Under is still very much a craft affair. Imagine then my surprise at finding a readily available regularly stocked Australian single malt for less than $50! While I got my bottle from my Flaviar Subscription I’ve since seen it on the shelf at the local Total Wine.Starward is a small upstart Melbourne distillery with a single pair of copper pot stills. They source all of the ingredients for their whisky from local Australian products (“within a day’s drive”) ferment the local malted barley with brewer’s yeast and then double-distill and age it on-site. Starward takes advantage of the availability of local Australian red wine casks (still wet with cabernet pinot noir and shiraz) steams them instead of heavily re-charring them to avoid disturbing that wine and then full-term ages the whisky amid Melbourne’s unique “four seasons in a day” climate. This rapid heating and cooling achieves bottle quality within 2 to 3 years. This is similar to how distilleries in India and Taiwan are able to rapidly produce whisky that compares to Scotland’s 10- and 12-year-old products.The marketing materials confusingly refer to this as “elementally matured” which sounds kind of made-up to me. The resulting whisky is bottled at 41% ABV (weird) and retails in my neck of the woods for a pretty reasonable $50 – $60. I’ve purchased younger rougher whisky made within my own state for that much. Nova is bottled without chill-filtration or added coloring. With all the red wine in the barrels they’re using there’s no need for adding color.Nose Resin and balsamico which quickly resolve into red grape and pomegranate. The malt is present but in the background providing a floor of malty sweetness and a mild nutty grain note. Pleasant and aromatic. A rest in the glass adds more sweetness and a layer of cake frosting.Palate Thin and very tannic body. Instantly mouth-drying. The tongue burn is negligible almost nonexistent. A reprise of the aroma notes – red berries port wine and balsamic vinegar with a vague malt/grain backdrop.Finish Of medium length. A surprising dark chocolate note appears which is downright delectable next to all that port and balsamic. The finish is very tannic very mouth-drying. It doesn’t evolve much but with that lovely chocolate note it doesn’t need to.With Water Now that chocolate is in my head it’s all I can smell. The water might have revealed it or my brain did. The water might be picking out a few extra fruit notes kiwi fruit coconut water. I suggest trying this without water and then with just a few drops to see how it changes for you.Overall I’m very happy with this dram. The price is acceptable considering how far it has to travel to reach shelves near me. The flavors are competent and even exciting in places and there are no off-flavors. It has a very successful sweet-dry balance and the red wine barrel components are shockingly well-adapted (which is rare especially considering the full-term maturation in red wine casks). If you’ve never had whisky from the region Starward Nova is downright the easiest way to do so and it’s tasty to boot.
392,Strathisla (12 year) - Strathisla (pronounced “strath-aye-la”) will go out of its way to remind you that it is the oldest continuously operating distillery in Scotland. Most of the output of the four small stills and small on-site traditional dunnage warehouse goes straight into Chivas Regal blends and only a little of it sees distribution as a single malt. In fact Chivas refers to Strathisla as the “heart” or “core” malt of its blends. While researching this bottling I found that the whisky was previously available in the US before its 2013 packaging update and has since been pulled from the US market. Whether this is a prelude to a relaunch or simply due to lack of interest I can’t say. Also confusingly the ABV of the product appears to have dropped from 43% to 40% with the new packaging leading to a lot of retailers having incorrect information on their websites. I even found a few retailers that listed BOTH 40% and 43% on the same listing. Oops.Either way the 12-year is aged in an undisclosed combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks reportedly with a higher percentage of sherry.Nose Round warm honey notes. A touch hot for 40% Abv. Orange blossom and honeysuckle. Very floral – reminds me of The Balvenie Single Barrel 15. A rest in the glass reveals some nuttiness and some lesser alcohols (grainy or grassy).Palate Thin body. Bakery treats and floral honeys dominate with very little tongue burn. Very drinkable and no off-notes.Finish Short. A bit of oaky tannins and some fading nuttiness – cashew? – with only a subtle bitter note. Falls a little flat becoming two-dimensional and stale. With Water A few drops of water open up some tropical fruits on the nose – kiwi – without losing anything. This extra tart note is welcome. On the tongue it does suffer a bit of wateriness. The finish is unchanged. Water optional but use very sparingly.Overall It starts promisingly with full honey notes and a stable of floral notes that compares favorably with similar styles like The Balvenie. The dimensions begin to fall away on the tongue and into a disappointing finish. Still a very drinkable easy-going malt with few overt flaws. I would buy this happily around the $35 mark but would regret paying $50.
393,Suntory Toki Japanese Whisky - Whenever I think of Japanese whisky visions of highly-praised but obnoxiously-priced scotch replicas dance in my head. (Yeah yeah it’s August give me some creative license.) Maybe the stuff is affordable in Japan but hearing about $70-a-bottle Hibiki (which I love) being artfully stirred with hand-carved ice cubes and soda into whisky highballs makes me a little queasy. I mean I love a good whisky-and-soda when the balance is right but you wouldn’t catch me filling one with Glenlivet 18 or anything.Japanese whisky to me is all about art and subtlety. It’s aromatic floral subtle and complex. That makes for a pretty compelling stripped-down highball with only ice and soda water to support the whisky and deliver it in a refreshing way. The history of the Japanese whisky highball and the drinking culture surrounding it is fascinating but I’m not qualified to cover it here. Suffice to say that I’ve made a few at home (complete with the 13-and-a-half clockwise stirs) and have enjoyed the simplicity food-friendliness and refreshing nature of such a drink. I just can’t bring myself to put actual expensive Japanese whisky in it.Until now.My prayers have been answered! A Japanese whisky (an NAS blend but that’s the kind of thing you dunk in ice and soda water anyway) priced under $40 and widely available in the US! Also it doesn’t taste like engine cleaner. So there’s that.Japanese drinks giant Suntory (which now owns Jim Beam and its related brands) has blended “selected” (read leftover) barrels from Hakushu and Yamazaki distilleries (both malts) and Chita distillery (heavy-type grain whisky). Unlike previous Suntory blends this one relies on Hakushu as primary malt not Yamazaki. The Yamazaki components are aged in both American white oak and Spanish oak. The Hakushu in American white oak. (In other words no Mizunara here). The blend is bottled at 43% ABV. Did I mention that it’s bottled in a glass brick? Literally I bet Habitat for Humanity could collect these and mortar them together to make houses.N Fresh straw vanilla and gentle grain. A touch spirity a first (alcohol fumes) but this settles down to reveal faint coconut grains of paradise tamarind blanched almonds and mochi rice-flour cakes. There are also some florals that I can’t identify.P Medium-bodied. Grain-forward with a honeyed sweetness and a subdued tongue burn. Vanilla and coconut again and a ghostly oakiness.F Medium-short. Chestnuts lemon peel vanilla sugar and fresh spring water. No bitterness or off flavors.W A few drops of water dampen the aroma somewhat. They might bring out a little extra lemon oil on tongue and make the finish sweeter but if you’re drinking this neat it needs no additional water.O While you could certainly enjoy Toki neat you might find yourself wishing for a little more flavor. Where it shines (and where it was intended to go) is in a Japanese Whisky Highball. I like mine with 1.5 oz of whisky and 3 oz of good club soda or unflavored sparkling water (something that comes in a glass bottle) over fresh ice made from filtered water preferably in cubes just large enough to fit in the glass. You could throw a twist of lemon on there too if so inclined. Thirteen-and-a-half clockwise stirs optional. If you’re like me and enjoy a refreshing highball on a hot summer day but can’t afford to dump Hibiki in them this is your answer.
394,Talisker (10 year) - While not as overtly peat-heavy as an Islay malt Talisker’s peat provides a background of earthiness that matches its rocky flavors. As this is one of the more complex of whiskies it may take some getting used to. Once you can appreciate it though nothing beats Talisker for relief at the end of a hard day.Color Golden orangeNose Sea air seaweed brine a hint of blood orange.Palate Hard and rocky evoking sea cliffs and tumbling waterfalls. Rock candy. There is a shadow of heather in the middle notes and a solid background of peat (but not smoke). Very earthy and mineral. The body is firm a touch oily and a little creamy but the mineral flavors contrast starkly. Intricate complex evolving. Finish Long warming and citrusy with previously hidden notes of marshmallow moss chalk lemon white pepper and orange peel.Adding a dash of water opened up some of the warmer floral scents but seems to mask the coastal notes. I prefer it neat. 007 wouldn’t have added any water why should I?Talisker is a dram to brood over. Like Ian Fleming’s Bond it is edgy steely and mysterious. It punches you in the face and then lulls you into submission. There is nothing else quite like it.
395,Talisker (18 year) - As best man at my friend Mike’s wedding this summer it was my job to select some whiskies for the bachelor party. As far as special occasion whiskies go it’s hard to beat Talisker 18 and The Macallan 18 (set your mouth on fire with some peaty Talisker goodness and then put it out with a blanket of smooth sherry-bomb Macallan. Oh yes). While this is not the kind of thing I’d recommend buying on a consistent basis it’s an excellent way to mark the big moments in life. Those extra 8 years in the barrel (see my review of Talisker 10 here still one of my favorite whiskies ever) really plumb the depths of what Talisker is capable of.Nose Evident peat and hardwood smoke warm malty overtones with very well-integrated cask wood. Everything is harmonious – peat and malt and wood. A truly excellent ex-bourbon peated Scotch nose. Deeper in there is a bit of minerality ‘sharp’ salty notes (although not savory) like salted caramels. The smoke is uniquely Talisker – not tarry or piney but sweet and round like a hardwood fire in full blaze.Palate Malty upfront with the smoke sneaking in behind to fill your sinuses. A long slow burn with a rocky edge from the hard water. Trailing off there is a bit of bitterness perhaps the barrel char showing through.Finish Long with marshmallow peat smoke verging on the wet acrid side and more of the bitter charcoal. Not much wood tannin. Some of that crispness from the hard water remains in your mouth. A younger finish than I’d expect from an 18 year-old.Overall It’s hard not to love Talisker. The peat flavors that made Islay famous for their intensity here instead get equal billing with sturdy oak and lusciously sweet malt. I could wish a little less bitterness on the tail end but this is totally Talisker and substantially more smooth and finessed than the 10 year-old. I can’t love the price but for a special-occasion whisky it’s hard to beat. If I had unlimited money I’d drink this once a week.Water A few drops of water don’t seem to diminish anything about this whisky and they may crisp up the peat smoke a bit – adding some nice hay and lime notes to the nose. Worth a try but don’t do it if you’ve only got one glass.
396,Talisker (8 year) Special Release 2018 - Long-time readers of this blog will know that I’m a Talisker fanboy. It was one of my earliest favorite malts and remains a special treat to this day… at least when I’m in the mood for a whisky that evokes harsh maritime coastlines and hardscrabble working folk with calloused hands and… *cough* see what I mean? Talisker just makes me go all poetic.A reader who is apparently more of a Talisker fanboy than I am ordered a bottle of the very-limited very sold-out and very not-available-in-the-USA 2018 Special Release bottling from a specialty retailer in the UK. I’m going to take a moment to complain once more that Master of Malt no longer ships to the US after being taken over by AB InBev. My new go-to for overseas shipping The Whisky Exchange or TWE was sold out. Luckily said reader-slash-fanboy found a bottle at The Whisky World in London and had it shipped to his home in a state that normally doesn’t allow such a thing. Here’s a glass to fearless whisky retailers clueless customs agents and loyal readers who feel like sending me free whisky. Sláinte!Talisker 8 is a very limited edition cask-strength (59.4% ABV) batch of the familiar Talisker 10 except at 8 years which is a bit of a reference to earlier 1980s bottlings of Talisker that were released at that age (although not at that strength). The whisky was aged in first-fill ex-bourbon American oak barrels that were “deep charred” whatever that means. (All American oak barrels are charred most of them pretty deeply.) That’s pretty much all there is to it A storied distillery grabs a few exceptional barrels shy of their OB release date and dumps them into a marriage vat without adding any water and boom. Worldwide craze. Anyone remember Tickle-Me-Elmo? Yeah like that. It’s also got a strikingly pretty label and box. So there’s that.Alas I do not have a sample of the 10 year to compare against. Update Here’s a review of the 2020 special release.Nose Oddly shy despite a rest in the glass. Classic unabashed Talisker black pepper seaweed salty sea spray and thin smoke. The nose tickle is mild despite being nearly 120 proof.Palate Medium body. Initially sweet and bready and overlain with those same salty peppery maritime notes from the aroma. Tongue burn is robust as expected. As the reader who sent me this commented “If you want to know how big a man you are drink cask-strength Talisker.” Cue the poetry. Vikings and stuff. Eventually I’m able to regain my composure and I can taste pepper jelly barbecue char hay and tobacco.Finish Long. Dry with more of that pepper-and-salt combination. The peat smoke is present but not in the foreground. Fades pretty much as it started and without bitterness.With Water Several drops of water releases a deluge of meaty notes. Uncured bacon smoked pork shoulder my favorite salt-and-pepper brisket rub etc. The tongue burn is just as epic but there are now additional flavors green chili nori and smoked salmon. Definitely try this with water it’s a different – and complementary – experience.Overall I’m not really sure what to say. This is exactly what I’d expect Talisker 10 to taste like if you just removed the water. It burns like Hellfire but retains 100% of its identity. If I had to nitpick I’d say it doesn’t bring anything new to the party unless you add a little water and then that effect is fleeting. I agree with another comment from our generous reader though that Talisker 8 at 46% would probably satisfy about the same as Talisker 10 does if this bottling is any guide. Just don’t tell Diageo that.The fact that we have to fight over limited-edition scraps to get a shot at our favorite whiskies at cask strength though is one reason I’m not a big fan of our corporate overlords I mean Diageo. I’m going to call this “Must Try” because if you like Talisker and see a bottle for sale somewhere against all odds you probably ought to own it. Just don’t pay auction prices. Above $100 is pretty steep even for this… just get some Corryvreckan.
397,Talisker (8 year) Special Release 2020 - Two years ago I reviewed the Talisker Special Release for 2018 which was downright yummy. Today I was lucky enough to taste the 2020 release thanks to the same longtime-reader and fellow Talisker groupie who I will refer to below as “Generous Reader”.Diageo does an annual “Special Release” of bottles from its stable of Single Malt heavy-hitters such as Talisker Lagavulin Mortlach etc. These are always pricey hard to acquire and only a tiny trickle of the supply reaches retailers in the US. I’ve never seen one on a shelf. Generous Reader gets his via mail-order from the UK which is an increasingly uncertain and hazardous operation as the triplet specters of Brexit Covid-19 and punitive tariffs make the international shipping of whisky a downright Mission Impossible. One more global retail apocalypse and we’ll have a full set of Horsemen.Also let’s note with spite that 2 full years later and I’m still unable to order anything from Master of Malt due to its acquisition by AB InBev.Talisker 8 is a very limited edition cask-strength (57.9% ABV) batch of the familiar Talisker 10 except at 8 years which is a bit of a reference to earlier 1980s bottlings of Talisker that were released at that age (although not at that strength). The whisky for this year’s release was distilled in 2011 and this time the distillery broke new ground (for Talisker) by finishing the whisky in a funky pot-still rum cask from Jamaica. How long was the finish? What distillery did the rum casks come from? Who knows this is Diageo we’re talking about so details are sparse to none.Nose Pungent vanilla cracked white pepper nutty nougat and gently smoked meat. The pot-still rum cask comes through clearly with characteristic funky banana coconut molasses and vegetal sugar cane. Oddly the sum of these has subsumed all of the classic Talisker peat. Even after a rest in the glass the peat/smoke remains in the background.Palate Syrupy body. There’s the peat! Holy firecrackers there’s a ton of smoke and an avalanche of briny peppery peat. The tongue burn is as expected for this high ABV. There’s also barrel char shortbread cookies and salted caramel but not a lot of rum notes.Finish Long. The party resumes on the finish which brings the joy of windswept rocky Talisker peat together with a bubbling pot of Caribbean funk. There’s only just barely enough sweetness from the rum to compete with the smoke. The finish is quite long and it evolves a little by adding spearmint carob and burnt caramel. A journey.With Water A few drops of water warm up the aroma adding toasty oak notes and waking up a little smoke. The rum funk is less obvious though. The palate and finish seem largely unchanged by this small amount of water. Water optional I’m not sure this needs it unless you’re having trouble with the high ABV.Overall What an oddball. The aroma is so decked out in Caribbean funk it feels like it should have a little umbrella sticking out of the glass but the palate is pure unadulterated hurricane-force salt spray in your face. The finish is a little of both. An experience… it took several tastings to just make sense of what was going on in the glass. I’m calling it a “Must Try” although it’s quite pricey. If you have a chance to try a glass don’t pass it up. If you’re already a Talisker fiend you probably don’t need me to tell you it’s worth the money which is even higher than last year. Ah! I found the fourth Horseman of the Whisky Apocalypse Inflation!
398,Talisker 57° North - Ahh Talisker. Although a prize pony in Diageo’s stable this distillery has always seemed to be a wild card to me. A fiercely independent borderline wild ward of the Diageo State always going against the grain and getting away with it. I like to imagine meetings at headquarters where all the cowed distilleries of the Diageo rank and file nod in unison eyes trained on the floor while Talisker causes trouble on the third floor – getting the interns drunk and making photocopies of its arse. Now while I’m sure that’s wildly inaccurate it helps rationalize my love of Talisker despite its corporate overlord.Lately however Talisker has been starting to show its megacorporate stripes by releasing mediocre pap like Talisker Storm trying to cash in on the NAS craze. Luckily for me Talisker 57° North is different. Duty-free only (a.k.a. the Screw The Whisky Customers Who Don’t Travel Internationally market category) but entirely worth haranguing a travel-worn acquaintance into securing a bottle for you. As reliable as the Talisker 10 is 57° gives you everything you expect from Talisker plus more. Talisker++ if you will.I have to say the marketing on this is refreshing – no obscure gaelic or strained nearly-factual allegories about the deer that used to graze in the valley by the water source. Just the latitude line that the distillery is located on – 57° (North) – and the ABV set at 57% ABV to match. Of course one must wonder if 57% was really the ideal strength… what if it tasted better at 55% or 61%? Ah well I guess that’s the price you pay for a good marketing campaign.Nose Nutmeg! A barrage of white pepper nutmeg smoked salt burning incense sticks salted caramel and salmon jerky. There’s a lot of complexity packed into this little bundle. It definitely delivers on the promise of Talisker peat plus a little something extra.Palate Thin body. Serious tongue burn (of course) with attendant smoke coming out of my ears. When the fury subsides there is fresh (spicy) ginger cracked black pepper and a sensation of salty sea breezes.Finish Medium-Long. The peat makes a comeback with plenty of brushfire smoke residual brine and only a faint touch of sweetness. A bit of mouth-drying tannin. Not a lot of bitterness.With Water Normally a dram is better when it’s cohesive but here I find the opposite. The separate independent notes of aroma create a chaotic jumble that very much works. When I add (a little) water it becomes more cohesive and loses something – becoming muddied. The palate becomes markedly sweeter. If I add enough water to proof it down to around 50% there’s a significant smoked fish element to the aroma. Also adds dried lemon peel and gingerbread (??) to the palate. I would only add water to proof it down if you aren’t enjoying it straight at full proof.Overall Well that’s Talisker all right. A big brutish dram with most of the complexity on the nose. It definitely delivers everything you’d expect from nearly-cask-strength Talisker. If you’re already a Talisker fan then you’re ready to try this. If you’re not a Talisker fan get comfortable with the standard 10 year first.
399,Talisker Distillers Edition (2013) - You know how it is… a friend brings over a bottle of something they’ve just purchased-slash-received as a gift-slash-stolen from a third friend’s liquor cabinet. You eye it knowing you want to study a glass of it and take notes but that you’d take a ribbing for it if you tried to do so in the presence of your friend. So you cleverly ask if you can pour out two ounces into a little glass bottle you just happen to have sitting around cleaned and blank-labelled. Doesn’t everybody have clean little sample bottles just lying around? So you squirrel the sample away and proceed to binge-drink the rest of the bottle with your friends waking up with no memory whatsoever of the aroma palate or finish of the liquid that is now making your head pound. You’ve also forgotten that little sample bottle stashed in your liquor cabinet. Thank God you remembered to label it.Fast-forward oh four years or so and you unearth this little archeological find while trying to squeeze a new purchase into your groaning cabinet. Oops. You forgot to review it. I mean whisky on the shelf now can’t be that different from bottles sold four years ago right? (Spoiler It can.) Surely your readers will forgive a slight gap between the bottling date and the review date right? (Spoiler They won’t.) Oh well. Here I go anyway.I like Talisker. I like it a lot. And uncharacteristically I’ve not been totally against releases where they mess with that pure Talisker goodness with wine casks and whatnot. The Distillers Editions from Diageo typically take the big-budget action heroes of the Diageo lineup and then proceed to drown them in sweet wine. Sometimes this works. Sometimes not so much. Here they take the standard Talisker (aged in ex-bourbon barrels) and finish it in amoroso sherry casks for somewhere around a year. My bottle was distilled in 2002 and bottled in 2013 which means (even without a big number on the front label) that it’s at least 10 years old.Nose Exactly what you think it will smell like. Salty briny chalky Talisker complete with briny seaweed-flecked peat smoke layered with a blanket of soft red fruits and raisin-y sherry. Some decadent vanilla (like melted ice cream) underlies the two. A rest in the glass improves the integration of these contrasting aromas.Palate Talisker’s signature briny peat hits the tongue first evoking seaspray and driftwood campfires and the taste of dried saltwater on your lips. This is immediately followed by a wave of jammy sherry nougat and grilled fruit (are grilled plums a thing?).Finish Long. Again the two halves of the experience fade in tandem both raisin-y and smoky sweet and peat at the end showing a final oaky drying tannin.With Water A few drops of water dampen the peat and release a fog of vanilla. I’d skip the water.Overall A satisfying experience. If you like Talisker (but are not some raving peat purity nut) you are likely to enjoy Talisker sweetened and contrasted with this particular sherry. The pliability of the jammy flavors yield to the harder aggressive smoke notes but are not overwhelmed. The smoke luckily does not appear to be diminished. This is like seeing a tough intimidating macho alpha male friend petting a froofy dog. The softer side of Talisker if you will and one of the relatively few successful marriages of peat and wine that I’ve had. (My recent bottle of Laphroaig Cairdeas is another.) Apologies for the extraordinarily late review but if you’ve been considering looking at a more recent release of the Talisker DE you can at least take this review as a baseline. I doubt Diageo has thoroughly screwed up the expression since 2013 right? Right?
400,Talisker Port Ruighe - Diageo has been busy recently expanding Talisker’s range and adding one-offs and duty-free (sorry “travel retail”) bottlings such as 57° North. Now they’ve added a permanent port-finished NAS expression with the double-entendre of a name “Port Ruighe”. Make sure you pronounce that “Portree” like the Scots. Nobody will know what you’re talking about but at least you’ll know you have the authentic pronunciation. I’m not going to bother with the history of the little fishing village or whatever it’s named after. Suffice it to say this is NAS (my guess 7 to 8 year old which really isn’t a bad choice for peated malt) Talisker aged in a combination of casks including ex-bourbon refill European oak and casks with a “heavy char”. The whisky is then finished in port casks and bottled at Talisker’s standard 45.8% ABV. Unfortunately for the majority of my readers it appears that this beauty has not seen its way State-side and (like 57° North) might be something you have to source via your vacationing friends who are probably downright sick of you by now.Nose Aroma is quintessential Talisker seaspray-flecked smoke black pepper and butterscotch saltwater taffy. After some coaxing there is a hint of dark chocolate and at a stretch raspberry coulis. Blind I would say this is just regular Talisker 10.Palate Syrupy body. Very hot at first but resolves slowly into heavy notes of rhubarb smoked salt earthy peat and caramel malt. The port is more readily detectable here with light red fruits and a slight tartness.Finish Very long. Talisker again with more briney driftwood smoke and deep-earth peat. Drying with flecks of minerals and some solid oak tannin. Fades with a whisper of tannic grape skins.With Water A few drops of water have no apparent effect on the aroma. The tongue burn is significantly tamed however and there’s a sense of bakery treats (scones or something) that wasn’t as easy to detect without the water. The finish might be slightly fruitier with some berry flavors. Try without and then with water.Overall Solid respectable but not all that different from Talisker Distiller’s Edition with the same “Talisker plus something fruity” profile. Unlike some wine-finished whiskies which take on the worst aspects of the wine and lose some of their own identity in the process this is Talisker through-and-through with a little top dressing of tart red fruits. A value-add anyway and not outrageously priced.
401,Talisker Storm - Regular readers will know that I love Talisker. It’s certainly one of my three favorite distilleries. In 2013 around the beginning of the NAS craze Diageo released Talisker Storm to much marketing fanfare and an initial retail price of around $70 – $80. The only difference between it and the flagship Talisker 10 a perennial favorite was the lack of an age statement and the use of (some) re-charred ex-bourbon casks. Why the premium over the 10 year which was around $50 at the time? Purportedly the selection of both younger (3 year) and older (25 year) casks brought more smoke and a better balance of sweetness to Talisker.Talisker Storm met with a flurry of mixed reviews. (See what I did there? I slay me!) Some reviewers appreciated the different perspective on classic Talisker without going too far outside the box. Others decried the higher price and lack of age statement. Reviews also seemed confused on whether Storm was actually more or less smoky than the 10-year and whether it was actually sweeter or not. Fast-forward 6 years and tellingly the price of Talisker Storm has slipped significantly below its stalwart age-stated sibling now retailing around $40 and in some markets as low as $33! It’s hard to say whether this is due to its relative lack of quality or if those negative reviews were a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s also impossible to know if the blend of casks has changed along with the price. Is there still 25 year-old whisky in Storm? If so it might be measured by the teaspoon…I somehow managed to entirely sidestep the whole fiasco. This happened for two reasons. First my local tasting group back in 2013 roundly panned the whisky when I asked if they’d all tried it. Second I tried Storm while entirely sloshed at a whisky show and my voice notes once transcribed read something like “urrrshhhhsh maybbeeeshh goood. I’unno.” Let’s see if I can improve on that slightlyNose Definitely Talisker DNA savory smoke brine and black pepper. The smoke is oddly more evident away from the glass – inside the glass the smoke becomes delicate and is overshadowed by unusually sweet malt. This results in the strange sensation of appreciating the aroma more above the glass than in it. The un-Talisker sweetness in question is a combination of shortbread cookies honey apple juice and pancake syrup (not maple).Palate Medium bodied not quite syrupy. Mild tongue burn. I’m used to being punched in the face metaphorically speaking by Talisker distillate. This feels more like a delicate caress. The brine is there as is the black pepper and the peat evolves properly across the tongue starting smoky and ending earthy. Still the usual Talisker-ness is missing replaced by a parody. A sweet one.Finish Medium-Long but doesn’t linger quite like the 10 year. Again there is an odd candy-like sweetness that accompanies the briny smoke turning what should be an experience of seaspray on an unforgiving rocky coastline into… a sputtering candy-scented gift candle. Fades with more of the same.With Water A few drops of water tame the sweetness on the aroma and bring out some lemon peel. The palate is brighter and has more tart high notes which makes it less cloying. I highly recommend a little water with this.Overall I see what the detractors are saying. This is Talisker but it feels like Talisker invaded by a troupe of Care Bears which have turned the crusty old seafarer into a dancing cartoon version of itself. I find this to be sweeter and less smoky than Talisker 10 although other reviewers have found the opposite.To be fair the only reason I don’t like it is because of my own expectations of what Talisker is. Taken in isolation objectively this is tasty well-crafted malt with a nice balance of sweetness and smoke. If you don’t go into it with the “This is Talisker” mentality you’ll probably enjoy it. Especially at the marked-down price which is squarely where this belongs. I would expect to pay about 20% less than Talisker 10 year. If you can find it for under $40 snap it up.
402,Tamdhu (10 year) - Tamdhu distillery during long-time ownership by the Edrington Group (of Macallan and Highland Park fame) played second fiddle to the company’s big hitters and most of its production was destined for blends such as Edrington’s Famous Grouse as well as J&B and Cutty Sark. The distillery was mothballed in 2011 due to surplus stock and then sold to Ian MacLeod Distillers who resumed production in 2013. The new owners gave the product line a much-needed refresh with better packaging and a truly nice website (Check it out and just start mousewheel scrolling) although they made the odd choice of bottling at 43% ABV for export and 40% ABV for UK distribution. A brief search of the Internet reveals a general preference for the 43% ABV version and no wonder. Aged only in sherry casks (European and American oak with a “high proportion” of first-fill casks) the distillery’s flagship bottling now sports a 10 year age statement. In my opinion it’s nice to see a product line ADDING an age statement these days. Kudos Ian MacLeod. There was also a Limited Edition 10 year-old bottling from exclusively first-fill sherry. That’d be an interesting comparison tasting! Thanks to ImpEx Beverages for the sample.Update 8/17/2020 Tamdhu 12 year has replaced this 10 year as the entry-level single malt from Tamdhu.Nose Pungent sherry. Orange oil funky dried fruits and sticky toffee pudding. A lot of aroma without much nose tickle. An undercurrent of malty caramel. Sweet but not cloying. A lot of depth here.Palate Orange marmalade. More funky dried fruit – prunes and apricots – with a layer of chocolate malt. Not as much depth here but very well balanced and flavorful.Finish Medium long. Orange creme popsicle. Slightly bitter – mostly in an orange peel kind of way. Mildly oaky. Fades with a hint of hazelnut and more orange peel.With Water A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma and wash out the palate. I wouldn’t say this malt needs any water.Overall This is like a love-child between Dalmore 15 and GlenDronach 12. It has a burst of orange peel with the funky “almost off” meaty/nutty notes familiar to GlenDronach fans. It’s not quite as meaty as the GlenDronach 12 but it’s much less bitter than the younger Dalmores. At this price point I’d consider it to be a “step up” purchase for the mid-level sherried spot on your shelf equally as deserving as GlenDronach 12 depending on your tastes. I know times have changed still I’m never crazy to pay above $50 for a 10 year-old malt. At least this one delivers in the glass.
403,Tamdhu (12 year) - I previously reviewed (and liked!) the 10 year release from Tamdhu after their major brand revamp. They haven’t exactly blown up since then but when I was at the liquor store in my full peri-apocalyptic hazmat gear looking for a sherry bomb to include in a Zoom whisky tasting for my college friends a bottle of the 12 year caught my eye. Now I have to admit I was looking for my go-to sherry bomb under $50 GlenDronach 12 year which I would have definitely used for this tasting if it had been in stock. The Aberlour was overpriced and the Macallan was ridiculously overpriced so I decided to take a chance on the Tamdhu.Aged exclusively in sherry casks for the full 12 years of maturation for that pure sherry bomb goodness Tamdhu uses both first fill and refill American and European Oloroso sherry casks. I’ve discussed sherry aging on this blog before and the topic is (as ever) murky. It’s probably safe to assume that the company is using whatever “real” sherry barrels (those would be the European oak casks) it can get its hands on while supplementing their supply with American oak (ex-bourbon) that has been “seasoned” with sherry. “Seasoned” here means the casks are painted with a sherry-derived sludge and allowed to sit for a few weeks or months. As gross as that sounds the practice is widespread and due to the very low global demand for aged sherry it’s the only thing standing between us and a dramatic lack of sherry-aged whisky.The 12-year expression was launched in the Fall of 2018 to replace the 10 year. It’s not often these days that a single-malt brand increases the age-statement on its flagship expression. The whisky is bottled at 43% ABV without added color or chill filtration and retails in the low $60 range which is slightly more than the 10 year used to fetch.Nose Delectable fruity aroma with a lot of both fresh and dried/jammy fruits blackberry pear fig raisin red currant and red apples. Under all the fruit there is a layer of pound cake and butterscotch. A rest in the glass reveals a mild tart vinegar note like sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar. Polished… downright elegant.Palate Moderate nearly syrupy body. On the tongue the fruits turn predominantly dried prune raisin fig cake berry jam. There is quite a lot of oak with barrel char that is almost smoky and tannic slightly astringent oak that starts to dominate. The grain is very much in the background overshadowed by the oak and dried fruits.Finish Medium length. Charcoal again with surprisingly little of the fruit notes carrying through. Mouth-drying oak tannins slightly bitter barrel char and a tinge of menthol on the tail end.With Water A few drops of water increase the nose tickle without adding much else. The water brightens up the fruit on the palate though and adds a layer of malty sweetness that was lacking. The finish also picks up a tart note. Water is a great idea with this one.Overall This has an excellent aroma and a decently well-balanced array of flavors on the tongue. However it starts to disappoint on the finish which is where it falls down against classic sherry bombs like Macallan and GlenDronach. It’s around the same level of quality as the retired Tamdhu 10 year although the extra maturation has added both fruit and bitterness in equal measure. I’m happy with the purchase but missing my GlenDronach 12.
404,Tamnavulin Double Cask - Odd isn’t it that despite nearly 10 years of tasting and writing about scotch whisky I can still pick up a bottle and think “That’s a real distillery?” There is still so much to learn about this golden elixir. In fact it’s part of the reason my blog is still called “The Scotch Noob”… I will never not be a noob. I will never not be learning about whisky.Tamnavulin is indeed a large (6 stills) Speyside distillery located confusingly in the village of Tomnavoulin. Relatively new Scottish distillery wise it was constructed in 1966 and was quiet for a 12-year span reopening after renovation in 2007. Like Jura and Dalmore Tamnavulin is owned and operated by Whyte & Mackay (now a division of Emperador). As is the case with most of the “lesser-known” distilleries the vast majority of its output is used in blends primarily those made by Whyte & Mackay. Tamnavulin whisky was finally marketed once again as a single malt starting in 2016.The website for Tamnavulin looks like it was designed by Diageo there’s so little tangible information. It seems like the Double Cask refers to a maturation in American oak ex-bourbon and then a partial finish in ex-sherry casks. There is no age statement and the whisky is bottled at the bare minimum of 40% ABV with no mention of the use of color or chill filtration (which almost certainly means they use both). This is all bad news on paper so let’s see what happens in the glass.A cursory examination of online whisky retailers shows that while Tamnavulin whisky is available in the US it is only carried at a few shops. Distribution is much wider in Europe and the UK. The Double Cask was the first modern single malt expression from Tamnavulin which now also sells a Sherry Cask a Red Wine Cask and a number of exclusive editions.Nose Meaty nutty and malty. Deep oily notes of beeswax and coconut butter. The oily toasted nut aroma almost reminds me of ghee. The sherry notes are very faint – mostly adding the nuttiness and a faint suggestion of dates or prunes.Palate Thin body. The tongue burn is almost nonexistent. There is a hint of smoke like smoked salt but mostly it’s all about toasted nuts dates and chewy buttery toffee.Finish Medium-long. Those same aroma notes are back with a vengeance – deep and robust buttery flavors continue through the finish along with toasted nuts and a bit of port wine. This evolves slightly adding black licorice before fading.With Water A few drops of water add a little sweetness – which wasn’t lacking – but amps up the tongue burn. It also adds a bit of menthol to the finish. Maybe try it without water first and then add a little to see what it does for you.Overall Very lovely and unexpectedly deep flavors. The butter is what gets me – that’s not something I normally find in a whisky. It reminds me a bit of GlenDronach 12 year but with less fruit and more butter/nuttiness. Too bad this isn’t really available in the US. When it is I hope it stays around the $40 mark which is where it belongs. I also hope the distillery decides to read the room and release the whisky at 43% or 46% without color or chill-filtration and maybe even cop to an age statement. A noob can dream.
405,Té Bheag - Well this was interesting. I don’t normally taste things blind. For one reason anyone who pretends to know anything about wine beer spirits etc. knows to avoid blind tastings like the plague because they have a way of revealing exactly how full of crap we are. For example at a recent tasting group I attended 24 whisky enthusiasts had two chances to guess the origin of a mystery pour for an opportunity to win a bottle. It turned out to be Johnnie Walker Green Label (which is now back on shelves after a hiatus) and nobody even got close. At a similar event last year nobody was even able to guess that a blind pour was rum instead of whisky!So when reader Scott N. sent me a blind sample to get my opinion I was wary. It was medium-gold in color like an average ex-bourbon-matured single malt so no help there. The nose was significantly iodine-heavy which hinted at peat (although it wasn’t smoky) and some industrial oils and coconut reminded me of Redbreast. I guessed either Irish whisky or an American malt (or some other grain like quinoa) aged in a cask previously containing peat.Turns out I wasn’t 100% off as the sample turned out to be Té Bheag (pronounced ‘chey vek’) a blended scotch with a big peated malt component made by Pràban na Linne Ltd. on the Isle of Skye. Boasting a high malt content of 40% malt and a peaty profile Té Bheag is not chill-filtered and bottled at 40% ABV. The malts are purportedly in the range of 5 – 11 years and come from Islay Island (Talisker I’m guessing) Highland and Speyside. Some portion of the malts used were aged in ex-sherry casks.This competes directly with (and beats in my opinion) peated blends like Black Bottle Isle of Skye and The Black Grouse. Unfortunately it’s not widely available in the US.On to the tasting notes! Please remember that these notes were written while tasting blind which show clearly that I don’t really know what the heck I’m talking about.Color Medium gold like an average ex-bourbon matured single malt.Nose A *strong* whiff of Iodine with a savory undertone – like soy sauce or Thai fish sauce (but not fishy). There’s also a layer of industrial oils which reminds me of Springbank. An unusual grain profile suggesting quinoa or oats or something.Palate Silky syrupy body. Slightly sweet on the outset with a hint of peat (or maybe that’s the iodine again) after awhile. Some barrel char on the mid-palate and a few baking spices (anise cardamom especially). Remains sweet in a cereal way but not particularly fruity.Finish Medium-long. A slight oiliness and a hint of toasted coconut. Meaty and not bitter. Fades with the coconut.With Water A few drops of water make the nose sweeter which now definitely smells like Thai fish sauce. Palate/finish unchanged.Overall I quite like it although the savory/iodine on the nose is teetering on the edge of “rotting meat” without quite falling over. There’s a good heavy body a lot of complexity and interesting coconut all of which are things that I like about Redbreast and (sort of) Springbank. If you can find it and you like a little peat in your blended scotch this is definitely worth investigation.
406,Teacher’s Highland Cream - Well it’s a blend. Specifically a $20 blend of Scotch malt and grain whisky. Like J&B Cutty Sark Johnnie Walker Famous Grouse and others it occupies the industry “sweet spot” – just above no-name $10/bottle swill and just below the entry-level Single Malts and “premium” aged blends. Principally intended for mixing or drinking over ice I nevertheless feel that it deserves a mention as an eminently drinkable spirit neat.Teacher’s is reportedly a blend of around 45% single malt with Scottish grain whisky which is quite a bit higher than the 20% to 30% found in other widely-available blends. The dominant malt is Ardmore which is owned by the same parent company. First bottled in 1830 by its namesake William Teacher it has enjoyed a long popularity in the British Isles.Nose Young grain is predominant as expected with undertones of the typical caramel and treacle notes. Additionally there is a greasy nutty clarified butter scent – like ghee. A dash of water brings out little extra – maybe a ghost of crushed peanuts.Palate That young grain is up front – flavors of fresh hay raw oats figs buttered scones and – way in the background – hazelnut toffee. There is a nice creaminess to the mouthfeel more body than I’d expect in a young blend. A dash of water thins the body slightly.Finish Medium-long and slightly unpleasant machine oil bitter coffee grounds and echoes of the toffee. A little water mellows the finish rounding out the flavors and sweetening them candied walnuts and light brown sugar.I would say this is a small step above The Famous Grouse in pleasing flavors and the creamy mouthfeel is quite nice in such an inexpensive blend. Props also for the higher malt content. Worth a try if you’re looking for a staple liquor cabinet blended Scotch for under $25.
407,Teeling Revival (15 year) Irish Single Malt Whiskey - The Teeling family founders and former proprietors of the Cooley Distillery and now running the new Teeling distillery have released a series of sourced rare whiskeys to commemorate the opening of the distillery the first in Dublin in 125 years. This the first of four (so far) is a 15 year-old Irish single malt that is almost certainly a Cooley malt (it pretty much has to be that or Bushmills). Although word is their baseline NAS single malt is from Bushmills so who knows.The whiskey was distilled in 1999 and matured exclusively in Caribbean rum casks and bottled without chill filtration at 46% ABV. Only 10000 bottles of the limited edition were released and retailed in select countries (not the US) for £85 to £100.Nose Dripping with rum notes (vegetal sugar cane fibers molasses raw cane juice) and tropical fruits (kiwi orange peel pineapple) and a touch of menthol there is still a layer of barley grain under all of the adornments. Very nice.Palate Syrupy body. Passionfruit up front with bubble gum (tutti-frutti) cane sugar and fruit punch. Light tongue burn but no further development.Finish Medium-long. More fruits now accompanied by tropical flowers usher out the finish. No off notes.With Water A few drops of water initially mute the aroma requiring a rest. The water does seem to perk up the fruity notes and adds a bit of nondescript perfume. Water optional but the whiskey can handle it.Overall A pleasure. This is what Teeling’s flagship rum cask finish should have tasted like. A barrage of tropical-ness that makes you feel like you’re sipping good Irish whiskey on a beach near the equator with no heavy cloying dark rum notes. Practically a pre-made whiskey Mai Tai (is there such a thing? There should be…). A pity this is sold out basically everywhere.Anyway if you find an opportunity this is a good example of the “right way” to finish something in rum casks. That makes it a “Must Try”.Note For a similar profile in a cheaper bottle check out Glendalough 7 year.
408,Teeling Single Grain Irish Whiskey - Teeling’s array of sourced Irish whiskey released since the inception of the distillery (all intended to raise funds to keep the company afloat until their distillery output is ready for bottling in late 2018) has been hit-or-miss for me. The entry-level Small Batch bottling is a disappointment while the standard Single Malt is just OK and the limited-edition Revival series has been delightful. None of these bottlings has anything to do with the Teeling distillery as all 2018-and-earlier bottlings have been whisky sourced from other distilleries in Ireland. Still we’re here to review whiskey so let’s review some whiskey.The Teeling Single Grain is a grain whiskey which means it is column distilled from a mash of multiple grains often corn rye unmalted and/or malted barley and wheat and made at a single Irish distillery. In this case the mashbill was 95% corn and 5% barley and it was distilled at the Cooley distillery (now owned by Beam-Suntory). The whiskey is fully matured in Cabernet Sauvignon casks from Napa California for “just under” 6 years (legally speaking that means it is 5 years of age). The whiskey is bottled without chill-filtration or added coloring at a well-chosen 46% ABV. This type of presentation is usually reserved for the nicer single malts and it’s nice to see a grain whiskey getting the treatment that frankly all whiskey deserves.This whiskey acorn does not fall far from the tree as the Cooley distillery (founded by the Teeling family) is known for its Greenore single-grain whiskeys. One could be forgiven for thinking of this expression as simply young Greenore aged in red wine barrels. Those must have been some prime casks because unlike Greenore this is actually pretty tasty. Spoilers!Nose Young fresh fruit notes of green apple kiwi and grape jam. Light but sweet vanilla frosting and only a faint “vodka” note (acetone). Light sweet and clean. A rest in the glass reveals a note of coconut water.Palate Soft and syrupy body. Low burn. Tons of coconut up front. Faint grape but without any red wine tannin. Simple syrup. Not much else.Finish Of medium length. Continues with coconut now toasty and fades without bitterness and only a very slight vodka/acetone note.With Water A few drops of water muddy the aroma a bit muting the tart fruit notes and revealing only a vague cereal element. No water needed here.Overall Surprisingly good if somewhat one-dimensional. The red wine cask might be adding some of the fruit elements but is very much in the background (a blessing for a red wine cask). Unctuous sweet coconut notes dominate the palate and are balanced by light tart fruit notes only in the aroma. A pleasant but unchallenging drink. I marked it “Recommended” mostly due to its price-drinkability ratio. If listed for very much above $40 I would think twice.
409,Teeling Single Malt Irish Whiskey - I’ve written extensively on the Teeling brand which continues the Teeling family tradition of dragging Irish whiskey kicking and screaming into the future after selling Cooley and its assets to Beam-Suntory. The new Teeling distillery opened in 2015 has not yet released spirit from its own stills instead finishing and rebranding sourced Irish whiskey to fund operations. I was very impressed by the 15 year-old Revival that I reviewed recently but I’ve also had a few Teeling whiskies (like the small batch blended whiskey) which I didn’t care for. The single grain was somewhere in the middle.The Single Malt from Teeling is a vatting of 5 (or more) difference Irish single malt whiskies of different ages (ages undisclosed) consisting of whisky aged in – get this – Sherry Port Madeira White Burgundy and Cabernet Sauvignon. Apparently one of the barrels was filled in 1991 (age approximately 23 years at time of bottling) although I’d guess the rest are in the “slightly under 10” category. These barrels are all likely sourced according to The Internet Source of All Knowledge – from Bushmills although the company doesn’t disclose its whisky sources. The whisky is bottled without chill filtration.Nose Green vegetal. Reminds me of aloe vera. Not sweet – only some faint vanilla and pale malt. Shy – I really have to dig around in the glass for the aroma. After a rest in the glass… more of the same.Palate Thin bodied. Some elegant vanilla bean and fresh cream up front is followed by a brief tongue burn. Next a high note of kiwi or starfruit which I recognize from Teeling’s 15-year Revival. Then an evolution into tutti-frutti bubble gum. Interesting and not at all what was suggested by the aroma.Finish Short. Some of that tropical fruit shows through along with a hint of menthol. Very nice.With Water A few drops of water do absolutely nothing for the aroma. Skip the water here let that 46% ABV shine.Overall A bit of a contradiction. The aroma is – to put it mildly – bad. An unpromisingly bland vegetable quality that even a few drops of water can’t improve. On the tongue however the malt comes alive with rare fruits and a continuous evolution that continues through the end of the finish. This is a bit like The Revival that I tasted but dumbed-down and cut off at the knees. I can’t really recommend this because of the pallid aroma and the plus-$50 price point but if you find it on clearance you might discover those kiwi notes that I liked so much and feel it was worthwhile.
410,Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey - I’m all for independents in the whisky industry. I think the fresh perspectives and propensity towards innovation are healthy for the whole sector. I may have even teared up a little when I heard that independent Irish distilling company Cooley had sold out with all of its brands to liquor giant Beam Inc. (which later was acquired by the even-more-giant Suntory to form Beam-Suntory). Jack Teeling son of Cooley founder John Teeling has struck out on his own and formed the Teeling Whisky Company with an eye towards replicating his father’s success. The company will build the first new whiskey distillery in Dublin Ireland in 125 years. It is slated to open in 2015 with whiskey ready to bottle in late 2018.Until then the company is selling sourced and finished whiskies such as this one a rum-finished Irish whiskey of unknown origin. It is a blend with 35% malt and 65% grain aged somewhere between 4 and 7 years. The vatted blend is then finished for 4 to 6 months in Flor de Caña rum casks an unusual touch. The whole is not chill-filtered and is packaged in a very attractive bottle at 46% ABV for under $40. The bottle I bought was filled in January 2014. Teeling also sells a sourced Single Grain and a Single Malt.Nose Rum for sure. Raw cane juice and golden rum dominate the aroma. Underneath there is a very very light Irish whiskey – passive and apologetic in nature. One could even be forgiven for guessing this was gold rum in a blind tasting.Palate Now the grain steps forward. Hay and oatmeal lightly sweet. The burn is a bit intense for this low ABV. After some coconut and vanilla emerge and the cane juice reasserts itself.Finish Medium long. Caramel hard candies. Vanilla bean and rum cake. Not bitter.With Water A few drops of water reveal something lightly floral. The tongue burn on the palate is lessened and the body is a bit thicker. A few drops of water aren’t a bad idea with this one.Overall Huh. The nose is a disappointing takeover of rum leaving little trace of whiskey. The palate is more in line with what I expected but the lightness in flavor leads me to believe that the malt component of the blend is small and the rum is meant to understudy in the role of flavor. The overall effect is of one of those flavored whiskeys hitting the market where the transparent marketing leads us to believe that taking sub-par whiskey and flavoring it with something sugary is an acceptable business practice. This is a few steps above that but I would have much preferred something with real Irish character. Here’s hoping that the Teeling Whiskey Company can stay afloat until it begins distilling something it can be proud of.
411,Templeton Rye - Oh man. Every time I write one of these take-down pieces about some repackaged LDI/MGP whiskey with a BS story I think “Surely that was the last one? There can’t be MORE of these can there?” And then I look like an idiot and then I find myself writing another one and thinking the same thing. Ad nauseum. At least I saved myself $10 and bought the half-sized bottle this time. Have I ranted recently about the serious lack of sample-sized spirits in this market?Templeton rye “made” in the town of Templeton Iowa is purportedly based on a Prohibition-era recipe by Alphons Kerkhoff a local distiller of rye in the early 1900s. Historic rye from the town of Templeton (which would have been made by numerous farmers in the area not just one) was again purportedly a favorite of Chicago gangster Al Capone. Of course today’s Templeton whiskey is not actually based on any antique recipe it’s just four year-old 95% rye mash-bill bulk rye from LDI/MGP in Indiana which has been proofed down and bottled using local Iowa water. I guess adding water to something now qualifies as “making it”. Apparently I’m not the only one who thinks this kind of marketing in the American whiskey business is getting out of hand Templeton was sued over their misleading marketing practices in 2014 and paid out refunds to some customers. I notice that references to Al Capone have vanished from their website and that they now prominently discuss the actual origins of their whiskey.Like many of these “craft” re-bottlers of MGP product Templeton has funded built and opened a new distillery to begin producing (for real!) its own whiskey. Expect to see the first batch of own-distilled Templeton 4 year-old rye in 2022.Templeton is not by far the only “producer” to pass off MGP whiskey as their own. They share this distinction with Redemption Rye Bulleit Rye Willet Rye (until they started releasing whisky from their new KBD plant) High West (at least they blend it skillfully) George Dickel Rye Angel’s Envy Rye (at least they finish it in rum barrels) and a host of other small-time brands that have not come clean about their origins.Update Apparently it gets worse. As pointed out by reader Dave from Brolic Whisky Templeton has admitted to adding (legally) flavor additives of unknown specifications to their whiskey in an attempt to match flavor compounds in the original recipe (which was either 100% rye or 75% cane sugar depending on who you ask). Because the rye is not labelled “Straight” producers like Templeton are legally allowed to add up to 2.5% by volume of flavorings or other additives without disclosing this on the label. Read more here and here.Nose Subdued. Nutty with a soft nougat/caramel initial note. Not a lot of rye spices but also no grassy/piney notes. Just somewhat sweet and somewhat oaky.Palate Soft almost syrupy body. A repeat of the nutty nougat and sweet caramel notes. Very low tongue burn. And… that’s it.Finish Medium length. A one-trick pony it appears. The same two notes continue through the finish. At least it’s consistent. Fades slowly with a hint of menthol.With Water A few drops of water wake up a slight nose tickle but with no added aroma notes. The palate seems watered-down by even a few drops. The finish is a little livelier and introduces a bit of lemon zest. Water optional and not really recommended due to its effect on the palate.Overall I wouldn’t have thought a whiskey distantly associated with a made-up story about Al Capone would be such a snooze. On one hand it’s easy-drinking to a fault and pleasantly sweet and consistent all the way through. On the other hand there’s very little going on here. This is especially odd for a rye a grain known for eccentricity. It’s also essentially the same thing as Redemption Rye but 6% less potent and 20% more expensive. And I don’t recommend that one either. Just get Hochstadter’s or Rittenhouse 100.
412,The Arran Malt – Sauternes Cask Finish - Arran is a relative newcomer to the hallowed halls of single-malt scotch but has now been around long enough to turn up its figurative nose at the proliferation of craft producers riding the wave of popularity that whisky is currently enjoying worldwide. After all Arran was built in 1995 when you could still buy Macallan 18 for under $80 and Pappy Van Winkle bottles collected dust on liquor store shelves. Arran might be best known for its confusing collection of confection-colored carafes (sorry I needed a word for bottle that started with “c” to extend my unnecessary alliteration) with cask finishes of everything from Amarone to Tokaji (damn them for not releasing a Zinfandel cask finish!) although word is that they’ve begun to calm down with the experimental one-offs. They also have a core range of age-stated releases.I love myself a good Sauternes cask finish and this Arran doesn’t disappoint. Delicious and definitely a dessert dram (I’m on fire today!) this Arran was aged for 8 years in standard ex-bourbon casks before being transferred to a “selection” of Sauternes casks for an undisclosed (but likely short probably under 2 years) amount of time before bottling at a laudable 50% ABV and without chill-filtration or added coloring.Nose A deep dripping pungent plume of honey honeycomb (wax) and real wax candles meets the nose. Deeper in the glass is a solid base of cakey shortbread and banana custard. Oddly despite all the sweet treats the scent isn’t overly sweet or cloying. A rest in the glass reveals some fresh green banana and kiwi. A beautiful aroma.Palate Medium-bodied slightly syrupy. Moderate tongue-burn which recedes slowly. In its wake are cinnamon candies honey in various forms and coconut extract. Golden raisins (sultanas) sugar cookies and lemon curd on scones round out the palate.Finish Somewhat short but warming. Initially a burst of white wine reduction gives a nice balance of sweet and sour but this is soon replaced with hints of bitter barrel char burnt caramel and grape skins (although without much tannin). Fades quickly with a slight nuttiness.With Water Several drops of water sweeten and complicate the nose bringing vague florals and concentrated summer fruits plus a much-appreciated tart note (green apple kiwi or something) to balance the sweet. The palate is more accommodating and retains some of that tartness. I highly recommend a few drops of water with this one and even suggest experimenting with watering it down around 43% to see how it changes.Overall That nose! Wow. I could sniff this all day long. The palate comes across as a bit hot even for 50% ABV but does fulfill the promise of the nose with honey and bakery goods and faint dried fruits. The same is true of the surprisingly short finish this dram’s one weak spot. As mentioned above a little water brings the whole glass into better balance and heightens the good while muting the bad. This is one of the few drams I’ve had recently that justifies its price. Well done.
413,The Arran Malt (10 year) - Isle of Arran is a relative youngster on the single malt scene. A private venture the distillery began turning out malt in 1995. Like all young distilleries they had to pay the bills with releases of young whisky at high prices none of which met with much critical success. However when their malt hit the age of 10 the distillery began to see some recognition in the form of awards. Arran has followed up its younger releases with a rash of second-maturation expressions (finishes) that rival Glenmorangie and Springbank put together Moscatel Marsala (really?) rum Champagne and so on. The distillery standard 10-year however is a boring old vatting of ex-bourbon and (at a slightly smaller proportion) sherry. Like a good independent distillery with a free spirit (see what I did there?) Arran bottles all of its malts without chill-filtration and without adding any coloring. They also bottle everything (except cask-strength releases) at a respectable 46% ABV. The 10 year-old has been made without the use of peat although some peat is likely present naturally in the water.Nose Green apple. Light raisins. Tart raspberry. Pomegranate. Intriguing set of fruits on the nose – good tartness and nice if light complexity.Palate Creamy! Nice texture. Tartness. Some dried citrus notes – remind me of The Dalmore. There’s a good bit of complexity on the tongue where some malts just get washed out by the alcohol.Finish Orange peel. Not bitter! On the short side. Some warm cereal sugars.With Water Sweeter on the nose more malt sugar but some oaky bitterness appears on the finish.Overall Great value! You could do a lot worse with $45. The mature lack of bitterness plus interesting tartness in the nose and on the palate is a winning combination. This is the sort of malt that you’ll try as a novelty and then come back to for its quality. Score another one for the little independent distilleries!
414,The Arran Malt (14 year) - See my review of Isle of Arran distillery’s 10-year product here. Arran’s 10 year-old is full of bright tart fruits and mild malty sweetness. It’s always interesting to see what an additional few years (in this case 4) in oak casks does to a whisky – you’d expect more oak in the form of caramel/butterscotch or vanilla and for fresh fruits to taste dried or jammy. You also look for resin leather dust and other notes that result from new compounds forming from the longer aging. Like the 10 year the 14 is non-chillfiltered and non-colored at 46% ABV. Since the distillery fired up its stills for the first time in 1995 the current 14 year-old bottling represents whisky that was made within the first 3 years of production. It’s kinda cool to think about drinking a whisky that was truly an unknown quantity – an experiment – when it was made. There was no old Arran around to emulate or reproduce when this was crafted.Nose Pine sap. Leather. Dusty dried orange. Lavender (potpourri).Palate Not as creamy as the 10 year-old but somewhat caramelly and warm. Candied orange peel. Becomes more tart towards the end.Finish Medium-long. Some tartness with sour cherries and pie filling. No bitterness! Nice balance between oaky caramel and dried fruit.Overall Good whisky on its own but in comparison to the 10 year it’s mostly a novelty. If you love Arran 10 you’ll obviously enjoy Arran 14. If you’re looking for a deal like the 10 year though you won’t find it here. This price point means it’s competing with the likes of Lagavulin 16 the better Glenmorangies and a whole swathe of stand-out malts in the 14-17 age range. This particular bottle just doesn’t stand up to the competition and probably should be $10 to $15 cheaper.
415,The Balvenie (12 year) DoubleWood - This 12 year-old expression from The Balvenie is aged in first- or second-fill bourbon casks with up to a further year in first-fill oloroso sherry casks. While The Balvenie’s range is typified by honey and a distinct heather flavor the DoubleWood’s sherry influence is bigger and weightier hiding some of those delicate florals. The Balvenie is my favorite Speyside distillery and they have an interesting range of different cask finishes from port barrels to a new rum cask matured 14-year.Color Medium GoldNose Smells like peaches and peach-pit marzipan cedarwood and pine honeydew melon. A drop of water tames the alcohol fumes and releases a ghost of heather clover and mown grass.Palate is heavy with vanilla and woodiness complimented by a toothy mouthfeel. Flavors of freshly-baked sugar cookies caramel and marshmallow. The sherry oak presence steamrolls the usual house-style delicacy and notes of heather and farmstand honey but the result is a solid silky whisky that reminds me of bourbon. Interestingly the sherry fruit flavors (which usually dominate a sherried whisky) are light and in the background contributing only some dark plum fruit pit and peach flavors. A few drops of water brings out some floral accents without diminishing the powerhouse oak.Finish is medium-long relying heavily on the wood accent some caramel apple blackstrap rum toasted clove or cinnamon and red-wine tannins.Not as easy-drinking as the Single-Barrel expression from The Balvenie nor with as many fruit and flower notes. However this Scotch stands on its own as a beautiful example of what quality Speyside whisky and careful oak aging can do and with a fantastic price point. This gives oak-lovers a two-dimensional whisky with some unexpected twists all on a pristine base of one of the best malts in Speyside.
416,The Balvenie (12 year) Signature - I know you all love it when I review a whisky that you can’t buy. In this case at least it works out well because I don’t recommend it anyway. I should start by saying that The Balvenie is one of my favorite distilleries. The 15-year Single Barrel was the first whisky I reviewed on this site was the third whisky I purchased in bottle form and remains in my mind one of the best examples of the pure raw unadulterated taste of distilled malted barley. The Balvenie’s house style of honeyed heather-infused malt without overwhelming cask influence is one of the best in the business and this style is supplemented well by the wide range of available cask finishes each of which seem to blend perfectly with the base malt. It also represents one of the best values in 12 year-old single malt in the form of DoubleWood 12-year which is still the first whisky I recommend to newcomers.The 12-year Signature an undisclosed vatting of first-fill ex-bourbon refill ex-bourbon and sherry (like the DoubleWood but without the marketing and probably with a much lower percentage of sherried malt) was produced in a series of small numbered batches. It was launched as a celebration of Malt Master David Stewart’s 45th year in the whisky business.However I downright disliked the sample that I tasted recently (unfortunately I don’t know the batch number). While smooth (not difficult at a dilution of 40% ABV) the best word I can find to describe this one is “bland”. Little of the honey comes through for me nor any of the florals that I loved in the 15-year Single Barrel. The vaunted cereal notes here are about as exciting as white sandwich bread. Although some bottles can still be found this malt appears to have been recently discontinued (“retired”) in favor of the much more popular (and much better) Balvenie DoubleWood which I heartily recommend and the new 12-year Single Barrel. As far as I can tell the lowest price for this guy in the US was $56 which is about double what it should be. I love you Balvenie but good riddance to this one.Nose Yeasty baking bread – almost beery – and abounding with soft cereal notes. After a rest in the glass it acquires some faint citrus notes – bergamot? or maybe just lemon. The usual Balvenie florals are absent.Palate Somewhat watery. Tame on the tongue – “smooth” is I suppose the word to use here – a decent balance of toffee citrus lozenge and fresh white dinner rolls.Finish Equally tame and of short length. No bitterness which I appreciate and the toffee continues. Pleasant but not exceptional.With Water Water increases the yeast component on the nose in exchange for… mmm nope that’s it. Predictably water further dilutes that already diluted palate but somehow activates something that increases tongue burn. It does give an additional caramel note on the finish but at too high a cost. Skip the water.Overall Uhh. This costs how much? No wonder it was discontinued. With about a quarter of the character of the 12-year DoubleWood and about a third of the complexity of the 15-year Single Barrel this is one lame duck of a whisky. While newbies will appreciate its smoothness on the tongue and its lack of bitter notes on the finish there is little to recommend it in terms of flavor. A pity since Balvenie is one of my favorite distilleries. I cannot recommend this release and it’s just as well that it’s been discontinued. Get a bottle of the DoubleWood instead.
417,The Balvenie (12 year) Single Barrel “First Fill” - Now I’m a big fan of The Balvenie. If pressed I might put it in my “top 3” favorite distilleries. The Balvenie 15 Single-Barrel was my first favorite whisky back in the early days of this blog. I consistently recommend The Balvenie 12-year DoubleWood as the ideal beginner’s single-malt scotch and I keep a bottle in my cabinet at all times. A comfort dram if you will.I was thus excited to crack open a Master of Malt sample that I purchased in my recent batch (I buy a lot of these samples at once to spread out the international shipping) as it has been awhile since I tasted a single barrel from this Speysider. Unfortunately Master of Malt doesn’t print the cask # on the sample label so I cannot isolate which cask I got.The “First Fill” on the label of course refers to the use of first-fill ex-bourbon casks (casks the previously aged bourbon but haven’t been used for anything else). These first-fill barrels have been used to age Balvenie malt for at least 12 years and watered down a little bit to a reasonable 47.8% ABV. The whisky is not chill-filtered and has no added coloring (which is obvious by its pale straw appearance).Nose Bursting with tropical fruits kiwi green banana pineapple and star fruit. Beneath this is a layer of waxy tutti-frutti bubble gum orange blossom honey kaffir lime leaves and very light shortbread-like malt. Light and airy but packed with high notes of every description.Palate Thin body. Unexpectedly hot – piercingly so – which takes a long time to resolve. Fresh coconut meat caramel oak buttery malt and pound cake.Finish On the short side. Oaky and malty with only a hint of fruit (fruit punch). Some oak barrel tannin but not drying. Missing something.With Water Several drops of water (I wanted to drown it) add a nice layer of vanilla to the bubble gum and fruit on the nose. The palate is noticeably calmer and contains a little fruit this time. The finish is also improved with a rummy caramel and some fading menthol. Totally add water to this and don’t skimp.Overall Ok this is a weird one. It has one of the most intensely fruity aromas I’ve come across with a delectable assortment of tropical fruits. This is followed by a blisteringly mouth-numbing alcohol burn on the palate that belies its modest 47.8% ABV to the point of confusion. The finish is mediocre at best without any reprise of the aromatic fruits and with the mouth still smarting from the over-aggressive burn. Luckily it is much improved by the addition of water.This is a far cry from the quality and depth of flavor I experienced with my first taste of The Balvenie Single Barrel 15-year but I have a feeling such a thing no longer exists. I would not be happy to pay $75 for this bottle unless I was content to sit for hours smelling (but not sipping) glasses of it. You are far better served by paying half the cost for a bottle of the DoubleWood 12-year or splurging on something else. There is always an inherent risk in tasting single barrel releases. You might love it and be unable to secure a second bottle from the same cask or you might get a “bad cask” and hate it despite the majority of casks getting positive reviews. I believe the latter is the case here. If you have the ability to try a sample before buying a specific numbered cask of this release I highly recommend taking that path. Anything else is risky especially for $75.
418,The Balvenie (14 year) Caribbean Cask - The Balvenie producers of one of my favorite whiskies (the Single Barrel 15 year) has added this rum cask-finished expression to their permanent line. As always it’s nice to see a distillery that is willing to expand its ‘standard’ line rather than rest on its laurels. This expression comes after a limited-run bottling of a 17 year rum cask which had been matured in the cask not just finished. There is also a golden rum finished version which is exclusive to travel retail.Nose Golden raisins green grass marshmallows. More ‘white rum’ than dark. A little winey like white port. A dash of water wakes up the dram – passion fruit limeade and bright florals.Palate Medium-thick mouthfeel. Minimal burn gives way to round maltiness sweet bakery goods and a green vegetal note. Brown sugar. With the water there is more green sugarcane.Finish Medium-long nice and oaky with a distinct lack of bitterness. A bit of sassafras and molasses on the fade-out. Pleasant.Overall A nice round whisky with an interesting twist. The rum doesn’t come through as “rummy” but more vegetal and malty. In fact the expected molasses note doesn’t appear until the tail-end of the finish. That said it’s a nice easy-drinking Balvenie with clear malt character. Unfortunately I think this one is priced a little high as it’s not significantly better than the (12 year) DoubleWood which can be found for under $40 and it’s not as good as the (15 year) Single Barrel which is similarly priced.If you do try a dram I think the water amps up the flavor and reveals a full range of very nice Balvenie house characteristics. I suggest the water.
419,The Balvenie (15 year) Single Barrel Cask #201 - The Balvenie is owned by William Grant & Sons which also built Glenfiddich. While its sibling distillery wins the popularity contest The Balvenie is not to be overlooked. This whisky is exceptional for its honey-heather flavors and aromas which arise from the heather growing in the hills above the distillery’s location in the Speyside region over which the water that ends up in The Balvenie flows. The “Single Barrel” designation is interesting. It means that the individual characteristics which arise in a given barrel are present only in the 350 or so bottles which are filled from that cask. This means that The Balvenie you drink now could be vastly different from the bottle you buy next year or even from the bottle you purchase across the street on the same day! The cask number cask fill date bottling date and bottle number are printed on the label. This explains the vastly different tasting notes you might find from tasters of this Scotch. Rest assured whichever barrel you are drinking from it will retain The Balvenie’s signature heather-and-honey flavors and will likely yield up several fruits and flowers for you to identify. A single tasting event could be run simply from bottles of The Balvenie from different bottling runs!Cask #201Color Rich goldenNose Honey and peach buttery baked goods angel food cake white port wine honeysuckle and freshly-cut flowers. Butterscotch.Palate Rich with honey and marzipan low-burn. Clear and unmuddied heather at the beginning middle and end. Like liquid candy but not cloyingly so. Delicate and floral on the attack growing more nutty and with darker cooked-fruit flavors… like peach pie.Finish is short but with a lingering ghost of lilac and yet more honey. This dram makes me want to be a bee in the next life.Adding a dash of water to the glass causes it to open up like a flower. Literally perfumey notes of wildflowers clover lilac rosemary blossom and peach blossom rush out of the glass. With water the floral notes persist into the taste overshadowing some of the sweeter baked-good flavors. This is a Scotch that should be tasted both with and without water as its character changes dramatically.When you’re in the mood to linger over a Scotch and appreciate the wide array of possible flavors as they evolve continually in the glass and in your mouth reach for The Balvenie 15 Single Barrel. This one is a marvel and because of the Single-Barrel style you can come back year after year to discover ever different tastes and scents.
420,The Balvenie (17 year) DoubleWood - The Balvenie still one of my favorite distilleries recently launched a big-brother expression to go with their wildly popular 12 year-old DoubleWood. An additional 5 years of maturation in traditional ex-Bourbon oak casks followed by a similar short (less than a year) dunk in ex-sherry European oak gives a perfect balance of fruit oak and malt. Skeptics might wail about the relatively brief sherry maturation (considering some malts such as The Macallan and GlenDronach are aged exclusively in sherry for their entire maturation periods) but it’s my opinion that The Balvenie’s house style is so light subtle and elegant that it needs only a dip in sherry to realize its full potential. Several years in ex-sherry would I believe wash out the distillery characteristics of heather and honey and would yield only a bland fruit-punch of a malt. The world is full of sherry-bombs The Balvenie is all about subtlety and finesse.Released to celebrate Malt Master David Stewart’s 50 years at The Balvenie The 17 year-old DoubleWood is a straightforward upgrade to its 12 year-old younger brother. More time in ex-bourbon yields deeper oak flavors and turns an already smooth malt into silk. Alas in these times of inflated whisky pricing and rabid demand for special-editions it should be no surprise to anyone that the 17’s suggested retail is a whopping $129 US. Ouch. If you’ve got the scratch though or can find it for under $99 it’s a truly transcendent malt and a straight-up improvement over the already excellent 12-year DoubleWood in every facet.Nose Juicy black cherry honey lozenges apple cider light heathery florals and a very faint raw green banana. A pleasure to nose with layers of fruit and light airy malt. Elegant and polished with no blemishes whatsoever. A rest in the glass releases more fresh banana and an undercurrent of oatmeal with brown sugar. This is banana I can get behind!Palate Medium-bodied. Fruit on the entry with tart apples and cherries again. Evolves into creamy grain and graham crackers. So easy-drinking.Finish A little on the short side but very nice honey-sweet notes and some lingering vanilla oakiness. Leaves you with an impression of quality and finesse. With Water Water picks up the nose tickle but doesn’t yield much else. No need for water with this one.Overall Tastes to me like a cross between the usual 12 year-old DoubleWood and the 15 single-barrel. While the extra age is apparent I would have said it was the same age as the 15-year in a blind tasting. That said the marriage of elegant light bourbon-aged Balvenie malt with a cavalcade of fresh sweet fruit from the brief dip in sherry barrels is spot-on like the 12 DoubleWood with a little more of everything that makes it great a bit more refined and less bitter oak on the finish. A pleasure but at this price point – definitely a splurge.
421,The BenRiach (10 year) “Curiositas” - BenRiach is a Speyside distillery that recently underwent significant renovations and was reopened after a period of inactivity. ‘Curiositas’ is so named because relatively few Speyside malts are peated especially to this degree. It is not exactly an attempt to imitate the Islay style which often has more maritime flavors of seaweed brine and iodine. Instead BenRiach seems to be experimenting with the earthy woody aspects of peating.Color is a pale straw yellow lighter even than a Sauvignon Blanc wine.The peat is evident in the aroma although not as smoke-heavy as a Laphroaig. There is some cherry in the scent and a suggestion of Grapefruit or blood orange. The peat is complicated by an overtone of wood varnish.The palate is crisp and focused with a little minerality very little sugar and an equal helping of peat and a cereal quality like Mexican beer. Some lime and limestone develops on the tongue along with a medicinal bitterness. I also taste grape skins or seeds – reminiscent of Grappa.The finish is oaky but without vanilla and is short to medium in length.With a dash of water this Scotch becomes more aromatic and a little less mineral. The flavors are challenging but the complexity will grow on you.
422,The BenRiach (12 year) - (Update 6/13/2016 I’ve reviewed the newer 46% ABV bottling with better results.)When I think of BenRiach I think of asceticism. The house style is very un-Speyside light airy dry minerally and spare. Tasting blind I would think it was a lowlander of the Auchentoshan variety. BenRiach is now owned by a small independent consortium known as The BenRiach Distillery Company which also owns GlenDronach and has done wonders there. The company bought BenRiach in 2004 saving it from a brief period of mothballing and promptly began releasing the built-up stocks as a variety of single-malt expressions which won it a lot of fanfare.BenRiach is one of those insider darlings that doesn’t yet have the mass-market appeal to make it ‘uncool’ just like GlenDronach. While I’m a big believer and fan of GlenDronach I seem to have trouble seeing eye-to-eye with BenRiach’s malt. I was underwhelmed by its ‘Curiositas’ expression (a peated 10 year-old) and this 12 year-old standard bottling is just too dry and lean for me. BenRiach has vocal proponents so don’t write it off solely on my disliking of it. If you enjoy particularly light airy malts where one must search for the complexity definitely give this one a try. Note There seems to be both a 40% ABV and a 43% ABV version on the market – probably one for the UK and the other for the US. This bottle was from UK retailer Master of Malt and is 40% ABV.Nose Light with some tart fruit notes (kiwi? green apple?). A bit on the hot side for 40% ABV. Some light toasty oak notes underline the fruit and a bit of vanilla. The tart notes verge on vinegary especially right out of the bottle.Palate Nicely creamy body. Hay and raw oats followed by light brown sugar and a nice even maltiness. Clean and crisp.Finish Honey and malt. Some light oaky bitterness fades out with nondescript florals.With Water Water releases a very nice array of florals and some green grass notes and aloe. Definitely try it with a few drops.Overall Not my new favorite although I can see the tart notes in the nose being a draw. The palate is even and crisp with clear flavors of barley and light oak. It seems to me however to be a bit of a blank canvas and the vinegar on the nose is a bit more sour than I’d like. In fact the leanness of the malt is such that I’d wonder if it was a lowlander – it bears a lot of resemblance to younger Auchentoshan. I do believe that while going through a full bottle this style will grow on you but upon first impression I’m not a fan.
423,The BenRiach (12 year) (46% ABV Presentation) - After two unsuccessful attempts to enjoy The BenRiach I decided to give it another go when I saw that the company had repackaged its flagship malt with a 46% ABV bottling for the US market (it’s 43% ABV in the UK market). My previous review of this bottling (40%) showed it to be ultra-light to the point of blandness eliciting a comparison to Auchentoshan. Turns out all this malt needed was a beefier bottling strength and (presumably) a little more care in barrel selection.I’m often asked for examples of each of the main types of single-malt scotch. It’s easy to rattle off Macallan or GlenDronach as prime examples of the full sherry treatment and Laphroaig or Ardbeg as models of fully-peated malt. Now at last I have something other than Glenlivet or Auchentoshan to hold up as an object lesson in malt aged exclusively in ex-bourbon casks.BenRiach and sister distillery GlenDronach made news in April of 2016 when it was announced that bourbon giant Brown-Foreman (of Jack Daniels fame) had purchased The BenRiach Distillery Company and its brands and holdings including distilleries BenRiach GlenDronach and Glenglassaugh. Join me in raising a glass to another lost independent voice in the continuously-conglomerating whisky industry. Here’s hoping that GlenDronach and BenRiach are able to continue their dedication to craft and quality under the new leadership.Nose Bready with distinct notes of honeyed scones buttery shortbread cookies vanilla beans and banana cream pie. A faint lemony tartness hangs over the rest giving a good balance of tart and sweet.Palate Full body. Malty sweetness rushes to the fore dredging up memories of childhood bowls of sugary cereal but without the fake corn-syrup flavor. Freshly-mown hay buttered toast and lemon curd. Bakery sweets crusted in crystallized sugar.Finish A reprise of the palate but with toasty oak and the faintest peat like wisps of smoke from a fruitwood campfire just starting to catch. Ends with hazelnut butter which fades into just-slightly bitter oak tannins and charcoal.With Water A few drops of water amp up the lemon and banana notes and introducing a decadent sugary glaze. These persist to the tongue. If you like your malt dessert-like and sweet definitely experiment with a little water in this.Overall This is an exemplar of the category of unpeated single malts aged exclusively in ex-bourbon. Unlike some other Speyside ex-bourbon malts which are more like blank canvases that need a little sherry to bring them to their full potential The BenRiach 12 showcases the twin effects of good ex-bourbon aging clarity of grain and sweetness of oak. It does this with flawless whiskymaking and precise aging. If you can find it for under $50 you’d be hard-pressed to find a better ex-bourbon malt for the price. For what it’s worth BenRiach also shines with sherry. Or sherry AND peat.
424,The BenRiach (19 year) Peated/Oloroso Finish 1994 - Once in awhile a deal falls in your lap that (if you happen to know what you’re looking at) can net you top-shelf scotch for the kinds of prices that people “in the know” paid a decade ago. Back in August (2017) K&L Wines snagged a parcel of BenRiachs for insane prices due to some kind of kerfuffle with the distributor. I’d not had great experiences with peated BenRiachs in the past so this deal took a bit of a leap of faith for me. Still a bottle of $150 (ish) 19 year-old distillery official single malt for $80 is a deal worth jumping on.This bottle (which I would never pay $150 or even $130 for FYI) is a single-cask limited release from the distillery (Cask 7352) which was distilled in 1994 from peated malt and then aged for 19 years (bottled in 2013). It was recasked into an oloroso sherry butt at some point (not mentioned on the label). The liquid was bottled at cask strength without added color or chill filtration yielding a supple 53.2% ABV which is (in my opinion) near the perfect strength for an undiluted expression – hot enough to be fully concentrated and flavorful but not in the tongue-numbing range of the high 50s and low 60s.I paid a fantastic $80 at K&L for bottle 99 out of a total 563. I now wish I’d bought three more…Nose Delectable tumbling aromas of dates chocolate-covered cherries vanilla latte spicy Spanish oak and a lingering but diffuse Highland peat (no seaweed or brine just heather and gorse – brushfire smoke).Palate More peat than on the aroma – definitely BenRiach peat austere and full of grasses and flowers while also smoky and almost acrid. A robust numbing tongue burn interrupted by flashes of dried fruit jams and roasting coffee beans.Finish Very long. A grab-bag of dried fruits now dusty. The same peat elements persist. This becomes muddy as it fades.With Water A few drops of water do a nice job of adding sweetness to the aroma bringing out oak on the palate and brightening up the finish. I highly recommend a very little bit of water with this one.Overall This is what I was missing when I dissed BenRiach’s peated Curiositas That Highland peat is very limited in scope and mostly consists of bland grasses producing bland smoke. If you mix that with a very active sherry cask you get FIREWORKS. Smoke and fruit in alignment and balance exceeding the few good sherried Islay malts that I’ve had which usually have seaweed or brine ruining the balance. Excellent and the fire sale that I lucked into made for an excellent price. If you can find a bottle for approximately what I paid (under $100 at least) and you like fruit and peat in concert you will not be disappointed.
425,The BenRiach PX Sherry Finished (15 year) - Sigh. It wasn’t until I began writing this review that I discovered this bottle was a limited release and isn’t available anymore. This has happened before. I’ve had a mixed relationship with The BenRiach from utterly disliking their 10 year-old peated Curiositas (in the face of a lot of Internet fanfare) to downright loving the purely ex-bourbon 12 year-old bottling which is now ALSO discontinued. It’s hard to pin down a distillery when half of the products you’ve enjoyed are gone and when they release everything from unpeated ex-bourbon malts to heavy sherry bombs including both sherried and unsherried heavily peated malts. They do everything but not (in my opinion) everything well.How can you have confidence at the liquor store when you’re not sure whether the next fresh-faced BenRiach is going to be heavenly or a bomb? Onward I guess to a review of a whisky you can’t buy any more and which will conclude with me suggesting that you Must Try it. What a jerk I don’t know why you people even read what I write…BenRiach’s chameleon malt has in this case begun life unpeated and spent an undisclosed amount of time (probably more than 12 years) in ex-bourbon before being transitioned into a Pedro Ximénez sherry butt to mature for additional time totaling 15 years. The whisky is bottled at 46% ABV without chill filtration or added coloring (a practice collectively known as ‘Craft Presentation’). It retailed at the time of its release for around $50 which is pretty reasonable these days for a 15 year-old single malt especially a sherried one. Nose Delectable bursting red fruits. Fresh jellies rather than jams raspberry coulis red currants fresh blackberries real maraschino cherries. Mild buttery toffee and a very mild nose tickle.Palate Medium-bodied. Coconut meat stewed fruits (pie filling) and hints of some of the fresh fruit notes from the aroma. Mild to moderate tongue burn. Some caramelized sugars and a layer of oak-tinted malt. Sweet but not cloying.Finish Long. Some charcoal and a mouth-drying coat of oaky tannins. The fruits fade quickly leaving the wood notes to linger. These eventually evolve into marshmallow and a ghost of black licorice.With Water Several drops of water initially mute the aroma necessitating a rest in the glass. Even after a rest the aromas are shy and the only new note is herbaceous. The palate however is brighter and a little sweeter with caramel-coated red apple and some added nuttiness. Try without water first then add a few drops if desired.Overall The “fresh fruit” sibling to GlenDronach 12‘s meaty jam notes. I tried them side-by-side to confirm and the differences when tasted this way are striking. A fun “diagonal” tasting if you will and worth trying for yourself with any GlenDronach/BenRiach where both are sherried. The ‘Riach makes the ‘Dronach more grassy and lively while the ‘Dronach makes the ‘Riach sweeter and softer.This bottle is everything that I like about sherried malt and not a hint of the things I’ve disliked about past BenRiachs. Had I started with this I would have put BenRiach right up there next to GlenDronach on my “favorites” list. If it weren’t discontinued for some unearthly reason I’d suggest grabbing it especially for under $60.
426,The Black Grouse - The Black Grouse a peated version of the widely available The Famous Grouse (see my tasting notes here) is not widely distributed and has received mixed reviews from critics. The peated malt is sourced from Islay which explains the “campfire” notes but (in my opinion) it is not married in a successful way. The peat is one-dimensional and sort of “stands alone” against the typical Famous Grouse flavors. Here are my notes and thanks to bartender Matt Knowlton at The Park Lunch in Newburyport MA for the taste!Nose Mild peat (not aggressive) with a thin veneer of sweet cider and toffee.Palate Big peat very Islay. Nicely creamy body. A little brown sugar and butterscotch is overwhelmed by nondescript peat in a campfire woodsmoke way.Finish The peat pervades like a Laphroaig but without the maritime flavor.Water sweetens the peat reek thins the body but elevates the flavors which turn bright and a little fruity. Definitely a mixer.Overall Not bad but you’d probably be better off blending peated malt into a favorite blended whisky by yourself. That said a bottle won’t go to waste if you want a peated alternative to your typical blended malt just don’t expect the moon.
427,"The Dalmore (12 year) - The Dalmore line has recently been revamped and along with it a change in the barrel aging mixture. The 12 year was previously matured with around three-quarters of volume in ex-bourbon oak barrels and the remainder in oloroso sherry casks. With the line revamp Dalmore 12 is now aged 50% in American White Oak ex-bourbon barrels and 50% in oloroso sherry casks. This shift explains the younger expression’s sherry dominance. I personally hope that the older expressions better balance the sherry against the distillery’s characteristic orange peel flavors. The 40% ABV bottling of the 12 year also makes it a little thin on the palate in my opinion.Color Dark OrangeNose Grand Marnier candied orange peel and candied walnuts or pecans. A splash of water brings out some floral honeysuckle notes.Flavor Major sherry with citrus overtones. Orange peel and orange liqueur notes continue plus a slight woodiness and some cocoa powder. Some of the more delicate floral and softer fruits flavors are hinted at but are overpowered by the sherry. Surprisingly thin body for such a robust whisky. Water brings out some sugary notes maybe a little extra fruit.Finish is medium length and warming with marzipan notes. Overall impression is of candied orange mixed with heavy sherry.
"
428,The Dalmore (15 year) - I reviewed The Dalmore 12 year awhile ago and was struck principally by the house characteristic orange peel notes. At the time I wrote that the sherry was a little overpowering and that I hoped the distillery’s older expressions would better balance it against the citrus and gentle Highland maltiness.Yesterday I had the chance to sample some Dalmore 12 15 and the Gran Reserva (not to be confused with the Cigar Malt Reserve…). The 12 was big and powerfully laden with orange notes as expected but the 15 took me by surprise. The 15 is good. As I’d hoped its sherry fruitiness was muted in the same way that 18+ sherried malts are – leathery and resiny with some umami notes bordering on meaty. Think old leather furniture and orange-scented upholstery cleaner. The house characteristic orange was in force but as a contributing player and not the main event. This 15 year-old tastes to me like a much more accomplished 17- or 18 year-old sherry finish and K&L has it right now for $56. That’s a damn good deal.(Before you ask I wasn’t impressed by the slightly-cheaper Gran Reserva which was released to replace the defunct Cigar Malt (again not to be confused with the new more expensive Cigar Malt Reserve. Gah!). It was somewhat dull – less orange less sherry less everything and with more rough edges on the finish. Review upcoming but definitely pay the extra $5 for the 15-year).The Dalmore 15 year is aged for 13 years in American oak ex-bourbon casks. It is then extra-matured for a year in a combination (3-way split) of Matusalem Apostoles and Amoroso sherry butts and then a final year of marrying in a sherry butt. That’s actually a pretty lightweight maturation for such heavyweight flavor.Nose Surprisingly mature sherry – it’s resiny like a far older sherry-finished malt. Thick dense orange syrup and essential oil. Leather. Reminds me a little of the meatiness of GlenDronach 12 and the suppleness of The Macallan 18.Palate Dense. Orange blossom honey with a bit more fire on the tongue than the 12 year. A bit of raw cane sugar grassiness and a pleasant blood orange twang (tartness).Finish Medium long. Nice spices like coriander and white pepper. Finishes with mouth-drying orange peel oils.With Water Opens up some interesting meatiness on the nose like duck in orange sauce or cooked marmalade. Otherwise it seems to dull the palate. Only really improves the nose.Overall This is a very fine example of a spicy supple sherried Highlander with the added bonus of Dalmore’s signature orange peel. Better than the 12 year in many ways it completes the picture that the 12 only hints at. It’s also better than the Gran Reserva which was underwhelming. Dalmore malts seem to go ‘on sale’ once a year and drop up to 20% in price for a few weeks. At $56 this is a quality sherried Highland malt for a great price. I’d even say it’s worthwhile around $65. If you want the same flavor profile without the finesse the Dalmore 12 is also a great deal around $35 right now.
429,The Dalmore Cigar Malt Reserve - I recently had an opportunity to taste the soon-to-be-released (this month) Cigar Malt Reserve from The Dalmore. This is a limited-edition re-release of a discontinued product (The Cigar Malt) which was discontinued due to customer confusion over the name (Does it HAVE to be paired with a cigar?). According to Laura Baddish of The Baddish Group who kindly sent me an advance tasting sample (thanks Laura!) fans of the Cigar Malt vatting began asking Whyte & Mackay master blender Richard Paterson when the bottle would be returning to shelves.Blended by Richard Paterson from casks of The Dalmore single malt of various ages with about 70% of the vatting from oloroso sherry casks and the rest from American white oak ex-bourbon casks the new Cigar Malt Reserve is specifically designed to complement the flavors and experience of smoking a fine handmade cigar. At 44% ABV (an odd choice but certainly better than the baseline 40%) and a whopping suggested retail of $125 US The Dalmore Cigar Malt Reserve will be hitting US shelves this month (August). Here is my experience tasting this dram both with and without a cigarWithout a cigarNose Characteristic Dalmore notes of orange blossom honey and Grand Marnier. Oaky old sherry which conjures images of polished leather armchairs and a whisky-stained wooden bar. Dried cherries in ruby port wine reduction. Deeper in there’s raw honeycomb and browning butter. Sophisticated. This malt’s wearing a tailored suit but the tie is loose and the coat unbuttoned.Palate Round and medium-bodied. Mild tongue burn punctuated with waves of cherry orange liqueur and sweet sherry. The burn continues longer than I’d expect in a product this well-aged but it provides a welcome counterpoint to the not-quite-cloying sweetness.Finish Quite long with oak tannins galore and a buttery Chardonnay texture. Fading notes of black raisins and dried currants stone fruit preserves and honeysuckle. Absolutely no woody bitterness. At the tail end a meaty fruitcake flavor strikes the final chord. A pleasure.Overall Opulent and luxurious. There is lots of regal old sherry-aged Dalmore in here with only a passing suggestion of the distillery’s orange-heavy 12 year. $125 worth? Maybe. It evokes moneyed old country club lounges thick with leather upholstery heavy wooden furniture and curling cigar smoke.Water A few drops of water makes the nose wilder and rougher and causes more nose burn. It also brings out the meatier dense qualities of the sherry. Loses some elegance. It does tame the burn on the tongue revealing more fruit. The water seems to make the dram younger somehow negating the polished noble nature of the elder components. Forget the water on this one and drink a glass on the side instead.With a cigarWhat makes a whisky good for cigar pairings? Initially I thought a peated malt something equally smokey would be fitting. However the smoke in peated malt can sometimes conflict or compete with the tobacco smoke flavors. To complement the dry acrid acidic and ‘hot’ flavor of a quality handmade cigar you really want sweet full fruity or malty drink that can stand up to the strong flavors of tobacco.I am no expert in cigars less so on pairing them but it seems to me that The Dalmore Cigar Malt Reserve has all the boxes ticked. A robust ultra smooth and luxurious malt that can complement any quality cigar. The big sweetness contrasts with the earthy dry nature of cigar smoke and does not fight with any flavor aspects of the smoke like a peated malt might. The orange notes are pleasantly palate-cleansing.The Oliva Serie V Lancero that I chose is earthy and dry with a strong level of nicotine. Such a medium-full flavor profile needs something robust and full-bodied to stand up to it and the Dalmore does well. I can see how a delicate malt or a light-bodied dram would get overwhelmed by a cigar like this. When paired with the Oliva the Dalmore takes on more citrus on the palate reacting with the acidity in the smoke. It perhaps loses a touch of the nuance of age but all of the major flavor components stand up nicely despite the palate-numbing effects of nicotine. Together this whisky and a fine cigar make for a very nice evening.Worth the price?At $125 for a non-age-statement bottling this seems a bit of a risk. Perhaps some discounted retailers will have it for under $100 which would bring it more in line with other limited-edition NAS expressions from competing distilleries. However I can definitely taste a heavy proportion of malt of advanced age in this dram and it certainly delivers an experience commensurate with the price. In fact it reminds me of a glass of The Macallan 18 year that I had last year (not this year’s release which lacks some luster) which is generally more than $125. If you have an opportunity to taste it do so. If you can find a bottle for under $100 it’s likely worth the price.
430,The Dalmore Gran Reserva - So I really enjoyed The Dalmore 15-year and I thought The Dalmore 12-year was a great bargain if somewhat on the rough side. So what’s this Gran Reserva thing? Originally intended as a value-priced replacement for the original Dalmore Cigar Malt the company aimed for a lighter and softer malt that would better complement a wide range of cigars. Why doesn’t it have “Cigar” in the title? Because customers apparently thought that it was suited only for pairing with cigars and sales suffered! They have since reversed that thinking and released the excellent (if pricey) Cigar Malt Reserve. Confused yet? I am.At any rate the Gran Reserva is still kicking around at a price point slightly below the 15-year and it’s still a little mellower than the 12- and 15-year. It’s a vatting of malts between the ages of 10 and 15 (probably 12-14 on average) 40% of which is matured in first-fill American oak ex-bourbon casks and 60% in first-fill oloroso sherry butts. The vatting is married in ex-sherry for 6 months and bottled at 40% ABV (boo). To be frank I didn’t think it stood up to either of its siblings although I’m sure it’s lovely with a cigar. Regardless this review is based on my tasting it in between the 12 and 15.Nose Lighter than the 12 year. Honey and somewhat lemony. The Dalmore orange peel is present but comes across as thin and insubstantial. The sherry does not assert itself instead remaining soft and subtle.Palate Thicker body with less orangey goodness than the usual Dalmore. There’s a taffy quality to the flavor sweet but not nuanced. It tastes like it’s predominately bourbon-matured with both less sherry flavor and less character in general despite the 60% sherry maturation. Frankly it’s not as good as the 12 and not nearly as good as the 15.Finish On the short side and a bit rough? Less orange. Some citrus like sweet candied lemon.With Water Adds a little more lemon. Otherwise no effect that I can determine.Overall I hate to dismiss a supporting character in an otherwise standout cast but if The Dalmore was going for softness and subtlety here they went too far. I’d even be worried that it wouldn’t stand up to a robust full-bodied cigar. If you have money to spend on a Highland malt with orange notes buy the 15 or the 12.
431,The Exclusive Blend 1991 - The Creative Whisky Company – independent bottlers responsible for the range of bottlings under the Exclusive Malts brand (and imported into the US by ImpEx) released this blended whisky containing 80% malt and 20% grain whisky which is an exceedingly high malt-to-grain ratio. An ex-sherry cask was involved but I’m not sure at what stage or which component. The blend is at least 21 years old and the vintage year indicates that all of the components were distilled in 1991. It’s bottled at a reasonable 46% ABV. I wish I knew what was in it to justify the $99 price tag.Here’s a piece of advice if you’re reading this and you happen to own or work for an independent bottling company. For each label you release put on your website AS MUCH information as you legally and logistically can! The kind of people who drop $99 on independently-bottled blends are the exact kind of people who want to know what’s in it. What types of casks what distilleries in what percentages phenol levels whatever you’ve got make it public and easy to find. If you’ve entered into agreements with distilleries to not include the name of the distillery then put hints or at least the regions and type (Ex-bourbon? What type of sherry cask? Peated?). Also leave the page available in an “archive” or “past releases” section for people who find dusty bottles or simply sit on them for awhile before opening.Thanks again to ImpEx Beverages and Katia for the sample!Nose Silky cherries and stone fruit but mild and layered with light caramel. Grain comes across as vanilla bean and sugary limoncello.Palate Lemon comes to the fore again with a background of oak. Grain notes are a little sharp.Finish Short to medium in length. Nice nuttiness with bitter lemon pith.With Water A few drops of water awaken an abundance of florals raspberry and a flush of nose tickle. The notes of the palate are heightened and more vibrant and the finish is more tart. I highly recommend a few drops of water with this one.Overall A light dram with ghostly wisps of fruit and wood from what is probably refill sherry. The dominant note is limoncello a first for me but the overall impression is of lightness. Old lightness to be sure. The nose is especially elegant with great integration between the refill sherry and the well-aged grain. The coherence falls somewhat apart on the palate fracturing into fruit oak and grain alcohol. Luckily a few drops of water go a long way towards waking this dram up.I would only recommend this to someone who is a big believer in older blends and looking for something out of the mainstream. It’s not the best blended whisky I’ve ever had but $99 is actually relatively inexpensive compared to other blends aged more than 21 years and nothing else has this high a malt percentage. I’m using a ‘Try before you Buy’ rating which is probably impossible but I don’t have a ‘Buy only if this is up your alley’ mark. Maybe I should…
432,The Famous Grouse - The Famous Grouse was first blended by wine merchant Matthew Gloag (grandson of the company’s founder) in Scotland in 1897. Now the brand is owned by the Edrington Group. It is a blend of grain whisky (purportedly over 65%) with unknown quantities of single malts including The Glenrothes Highland Park and The Macallan. Its malty character is impressive considering the high percentage of grain. The Famous Grouse is the best-selling brand of whisky in Scotland but is not as well-known elsewhere. The company suggests serving on ice with water or with mixers. I prefer to compare all whiskies neat however so my notes are for the whisky straightNose Grain prominent with marshmallow mild malty sweetness baked sweets.Body Medium with a slight chewiness.Palate Upfront there is a clear grain component. Resolves into toffee malt of indistinct origin but smooth and soft.Finish Short a mild vodka like grain lingering. Some pepper and a little brown sugar.Good but a little bland. No peat and no fruit but also smooth and malty with a nice toothiness. A drink-it-and-forget-it malt but certainly better than the bottom-shelf blends of lower cost. Does not compare favorably with the cheaper highland malts.
433,The Glenlivet (12 year) - A conundrum the 12 year-old expression of The Glenlivet can be found in a surprising array of American retail outlets. I got my current bottle at Rite-Aid for $24. One might be tempted to write off the biggest-selling (and one of the most inexpensive) Single-Malt scotch in America as a “for the masses” bottling of quality-compromised mass-produced watered-down imitation of real Scotch whisky. However a taste of The Glenlivet reveals a delicate balanced whisky with floral and citrus flavors a bright fresh minerality and a lingering sweetness. The Glenlivet epitomizes the “daily dram” concept of a whisky that you don’t have to feel bad about drinking frequently.While unable to stand up against heavier flavor-forward Scotches like The Macallan and Aberlour nor able to compete with the delicacy and complexity of pricier Speysiders like The Balvenie this Scotch is nevertheless a must-have for beginning whisky drinkers and even commands a constant presence in the cabinets of many enthusiasts.While The Glenlivet is aged partially in second- or third-fill bourbon casks it does not seem to be in them long enough to pick up any heavy oakiness. At most a background of vanilla is derived from the wood.Color Pale gold.Nose is a limited range of sharp and herbal notes not silky or caramel-like. Aromas of grass hay and green apple. There is some undertone of sugar and butter like stale shortbread cookies.There is a cereally brightness to the flavor developing out of the initial burn with notes of vanilla spices and brown sugar. Reminds me of hot oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon. There is something Bourbon-like about the dry notes like a corn syrupy sweetness instead of a malty one but it is a pleasant sweetness.The finish is of medium length but rounds out the earlier flavors and does not lessen the experience. More cinnamon.All in all this is a two-dimensional whisky with some pleasant flavors and no outstanding negatives. It has no outstanding positives either but for a single-malt that you can get for $24 at Rite Aid this is a good one to keep on hand. Its tame flavors also make it a prime starter whisky for newbies.
434,The Glenlivet (14 year) Cognac Cask Selection - Here’s something I didn’t expect to find on the shelves in 2020 a 14 year-old single malt with a cognac cask finish for $40. What is this 2012?In the arms race that is the modern whisky industry it’s actually pretty surprising that it took this long for someone to crack out a brandy finish. We’ve seen everything from Chenin Blanc finishes to Mezcal finishes and yet it took this long for a major market participant to put whisky in a barrel that previously matured cognac. Weird. Even more weird this particular example was aged in a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks before being “selectively” (what?) aged in cognac casks for around 6 months. I guess they were worried there wouldn’t be enough grape in the final product?The 14 year-old single malt is bottled at 40% ABV and probably includes added color and is also probably chill filtered. You can’t win them all.Nose Rich nutty and with a distinct brandy note. Not at all shy but also not particularly complex. Brandy a hint of green apple a swath of malt and middling caramel sweetness is all I can pick up. Still the whole is round and complete and pleasant.Palate Thin bodied. Moderate tongue burn considering the minimum ABV. Generally a reprise of the aroma with a distinct grape-y brandy note mildly sweet malt a haze of barrel char and a slight hint of green apple / green grape.Finish Medium length. Very consistent this one. The notes are mostly continuations of the flavors from the palate. The brandy comes to the fore here with a honey-and-raisin note that fades quickly leaving barely-bitter tannins. Again wholesome if uncomplicated.With Water A few drops of water initially shut down the aroma necessitating a rest in the glass. The aroma comes back slowly – first with increased nose tickle and a vague green bramble note and then a bit of caramel. On the tongue the body is a little weightier and the tongue burn lessened. The finish is a bit sweeter. Water is optional here – experiment if you’re curious.Overall A very straightforward by-the-numbers dram with a successful if uneventful brandy finish. It tastes exactly like you expect it to – Glenlivet with an extra couple of years of maturation and a glazing of grape-forward brandy. For $40 that’s a slam dunk. I would happily serve this to a guest or bring it to a poker night (I did in fact).
435,The Glenlivet 15 year - Tony Soprano’s favorite Scotch (for what that’s worth) was The Glenlivet 12 year. While not my favorite of the inexpensive drams it has its place in the whisky cabinet and has particularly appealing notes of green apple. If I had to have a single-malt over ice on a hot summer day that would be a good candidate (I wouldn’t dream of pouring anything more complex over ice). The next product in Glenlivet’s lineup the 15 year is additionally aged for 3 years in virgin French oak. Its deeper red/brown coloring is actually natural a product of the extra maturation in new oak and is not achieved by coloring. Bottled at a slightly anemic 40% ABV is this elder brother to the 12-year worth the extra cash?Nose Bright green fruit some green grape skins and acidic apple. White sugar and raw cane juice. Some interesting (but mild) spices cinnamon and nutmeg from the French oak.Palate Light. Some mild wood. A bit raw on the alcohol (like the 12) and perhaps somewhat watery. Golden raisins.Finish A twist here maybe dried raspberries? Some nice dry tannins. Medium long with a surprising touch of lime oil at the tail end.Overall It’s… just OK. It’s better than the 12-year which lacks a little age and a little wood both of which are present here. Unfortunately it suffers from a zealous watering-down. At 46% this would be a beautiful juicy dram and an exemplar of Glenlivet house style. Instead it’s just… OK. Normally I would always recommend a product that represented solid improvement over its cheaper siblings. However I buy Glenlivet 12 because of the price (as low as $22 around here). With a pricetag verging on $40 the 15-year represents a larger investment and has some stiff competition with other entry-level malts in that price range. I’d far rather splurge the extra 5 or 6 bucks to land some Redbreast 12 or GlenDronach 12. In other words Glenlivet 15 isn’t bad… it’s just not $18 better than Glenlivet 12.
436,The Glenlivet 18 year - To recap I think The Glenlivet 12 year is slightly better than its similarly-priced rival Glenfiddich 12. On the flip-side my impression of The Glenlivet 15 year is of moderate improvement that doesn’t justify its price jump. Today we look at The Glenlivet 18 year one of the cheapest scotches on the market to have reached 18 years of age. I enjoyed its nemesis Glenfiddich 18 and I enjoyed the price I got it for at Costco even more. Let’s see how this one fares.Oddly for The Glenlivet which staunchly uses ex-bourbon barrels for its maturation the 18 contains sherry-matured spirit at 12-13% of its volume. Glenlivet does not add coloring agents but does chill-filter its malts. Finally this entry in the Glenlivet range gets a bump up in ABV to 43%. About time.Nose Hint of plum but otherwise little sherry influence. Some vanilla but not much wood. Where’s the green apple?Palate Nice thick body. Creamy not oily. Golden raisins fresh green figs sugar cookies.Finish Not as smooth as I’d have thought for this age. Vanilla again and some small amount of bitterness. Anise.With Water Brings out coconut on the nose and some nice fresh banana. I actually like this banana – it smells fresh and clean. The water thins the body somewhat and ups the acidity but kills the palate in the process making it watery. Skip the water.Overall The nice thing about the 12-year is the interesting fresh elements of green apple. The 15 also has some of that but by the age of 18 it’s mostly gone. In its place isn’t woodiness or sweetness or even much complexity. I’m not sure what was happening in the barrel during those 6 extra years but it wasn’t doing much to elevate this casual standard whisky alas. That said it’s hard to beat a decent drinkable 18 year for under $80. That pricing strategy is the reason I enjoy the 12-year so why not enjoy the 18 for the same reason? Keep in mind that the Glenfiddich 18 has more flavor and can be even cheaper (I once found it at Costco for $44 a bottle!). Shop accordingly.
437,The Glenlivet Alpha - The Glenlivet is playing some fun little games around its release of a “mysterious” Glenlivet Alpha product. The sample bottle is frosted black glass and devoid of details except for ABV 50%. A Facebook app walks you through the usual tasting experience steps starting with color. Each is preceded with a decidedly Dexter-esque teaser video with blurry fruits and jazz piano. It’s not as cheesy as it sounds really. What’s wrong with having a little fun with your single malt?Since the whisky itself is quite light and with a pale “hay” color I guess it’s likely to be from a refill ex-bourbon casks. The app nudged me toward a two-cask combination 1st-fill ex-bourbon and 2nd-fill “New Wood”. If it’s 2nd-fill isn’t it not “New” anymore? Moving on… I readily guessed that Glenlivet wanted me to select “fruity” and “floral” (it’s Glenlivet after all) and heavy on the “vanilla.” The app is very forgiving and it’s clearly intended to give pats on the back for following the prescribed path. Flavor though has me confused. I get very heavy notes of dark chocolate and caramel but the app is not responding to my insistence on these points. I score 1/3 for taste. Oh well. The “texture” section indicates the whisky must be non-chill-filtered (why else bring it up?) and I already knew it was 50% ABV by the bottle label. Cheater!Nose Fruity. A faint whiff of smoke (or was that the smoke in the video? Ah! An exercise in mind control. I get it now). A mild sense of wax. The Glenlivet green apple is present but hidden partially behind a layer of caramel-and-wood.Palate Soft on the palate. Dark chocolate! Very nice. Mildly smoky in a roasted coffee sort of way. Caramel and heavy vanilla wood – unusual for Glenlivet. A bit of barrel char.Finish Chocolate returns. Chocolate-covered green apple slices. Yum. Excellently balanced and very sultry. The nose promised little but this whisky came through in flavor! I want some more…Overall Games aside this is some serious whisky. The aromas are fleeting and mild but on the palate this malt explodes with the clearest chocolate-and-coffee notes I’ve yet to discover in a whisky. It evolves through confectionery and reveals its heavily-wooded nature before fading – very balanced – perfectly without undue bitterness. I’m so happy there’s more to this whisky than just the promotional games!Let’s recap. We know it’s a 50% ABV non-chill-filtered single malt from two barrel types a first-fill ex-bourbon and a second-fill “New Wood” cask whatever the Hell that means. New Wood that previously held Glenlivet I suppose? It’s probably a vatting of years à la Aberlour A’Bunadh with some young malt to boost the fruity notes and some elder malt to lend that gorgeous chocolate tone. Whatever it turns out to be (the “secret” will be revealed this Thursday 6/6/2013) it was a fun game and I’m truly impressed with the quality of the whisky. Let’s just hope it’s not $100 retail. Don’t let me down Glenlivet! Update Well I won’t give myself credit for solving the puzzle because the answer was pretty clear in the Facebook app’s “hints” but Glenlivet announced on 6/7 that the “secret” to Glenlivet Alpha is the use of whisky aged in “new oak” barrels which previously held single malt. In other words brand new charred oak barrels were filled at some point with single malt (probably Glenlivet for an earlier release) emptied and filled with spirit that eventually went into Alpha. This gives the whisky the benefits of new oak (lots of vanilla and soft wood) without the harsh tannins or overly-wooded notes inherent in the use of true new oak barrels. Cool. Also as expected the whisky is not colored and is not chill-filtered but no word on the age of the liquid.
438,The Glenlivet Nadurra - Glenlivet the kind of whisky you get on an airplane if you ask for scotch isn’t generally thought of as a connoisseur’s whisky. Like the Budweiser of single-malt its standard 12-year expression is mild watery and (above all) cheap. That’s not to say it’s all bad – I like keeping a bottle of it around for nights when I don’t feel like an expensive or complicated dram. I particularly enjoy the house characteristic green apple note.The Glenlivet Nadurra now is more my speed. Not colored or chill-filtered and bottled at cask strength the Nadurra supplies what the standard expressions are missing concentrated flavor. It’s been aged at least 16 years in only ex-bourbon (American oak) barrels. My admittedly blurry notes from WhiskyFest 2011 include this phrase about the Nadurra “Very nice. Worth buying.” — what more can I say?Bottled 09/11 (Batch 0911p) at 53% ABV.Nose LOTS of vanilla. Am I allowed to say “Vanilla Bomb”? Perfumey. Some light but non-cloying touches of butterscotch. White peach and buttered toast. A satisfying concentrated aroma.Palate Significant burn for the relatively low ABV. Raspberry comes through as the burn subsides as does candied ginger and some of that vanilla. Surprisingly little evidence of the house-characteristic green apple which may be buried under all of that bourbon-cask influence. Progresses towards nutty with marzipan and some coconut.Finish There’s the coconut. Medium-long finish and finally some sweet maltiness.Overall If you’re looking for a good solid Speysider without heavy-handed wine finishes or sherry aging this one fits the bill and isn’t overpriced. Also if you’d like a gentle introduction to cask-strength whiskies this one is a lot easier to handle for a first-timer than something like Aberlour A’Bunadh or a cask-strength from Islay.
439,The Glenrothes 1995 Vintage - The Glenrothes a Speyside distillery co-owned by well-known independent bottlers Berry Bros. & Rudd prides itself on mostly-annual vintage releases which are chosen for their “readiness” as opposed to their age statements. The 1995 vintage (available now in the U.K. and slated for a U.S. release soon) was distilled in October of 1995 chosen for bottling in September of 2010 and bottled in 2011. I was able to try a generous sample thanks to Danielle at Exposure USA. Thanks Danielle!Every release is aged differently for variation in style year-to-year. (Update Not anymore!) This vintage was aged in 34% first-fill sherry casks and 66% in refill bourbon. This makes for a whisky with clear Speyside character signature Glenrothes butterscotch-and-toffee and a light background of sherry fruit. I think of it as a denser more refined big brother to The Balvenie’s DoubleWood.Nose Very lively. A heady mix of florals heather and honeysuckle with a lemon peel chaser. Peach flesh filtered honey and freshly baled hay. Gloriously Speyside with layers of honey summer fruits and light cereals. No overbearing wood here and only a touch of sherry fruit.Palate Gentle on the tongue viscous like thin honey (not chewy but soft and thick-bodied). Graham cracker butterscotch dried apricots and more honey. A background of fresh juicy plums and ripe red table grapes. Quite smooth.Finish Not a trace of wood bitterness. Supple and sweet medium-long and lingering. Some suggestion of dried fruits otherwise a continuation of the palate flavors.With Water Brings out white tea and peaches in the nose. Sharpens the palate slightly bringing out some nuttiness and cocoa as well as a few acidic fruits and citrus. Definitely worth trying with water although it doesn’t need the improvement.Overall Elegant and pure. Not too young (the fruits are sun-ripened and the grains fully ripe) and not particularly old (very little oak impact and no mustiness or resiny notes). A very straightforward picture of Speyside style. The background of sherry notes show a light hand was used with the sherry barrels. The lighter fruits and Speyside honey take center stage. If you’ll excuse the hyperbole this tastes like sunshine on a cool spring day. Yum.
440,The Glenrothes Select Reserve - I am always on the hunt for the holy grail of cheapskate penny-pinching whisky lovers (like myself) an interesting and flavorful single malt with regular availability for under $50. Currently the title is held by The Balvenie 12-year DoubleWood and for $43 it’s a tough one to beat. I’ve been a fan of the Glenrothes bottlings that I’ve tried in the past so I thought I’d give the NAS Select Reserve a shot. Note that this shouldn’t be confused with The Glenrothes Vintage Reserve.Intended to serve as a showcase of the Glenrothes house characteristics without a vintage year (indeed without an age statement at all) the Glenrothes Select Reserve was the first non-vintage bottling added to the regular lineup at Glenrothes. The distillery is tight-lipped about the contents likely in order to retain the freedom to reformulate it as necessary depending on current stock. It’s therefore only possible to guess that Select Reserve contains whisky vatted from several different years and from both types of wood used at Glenrothes (ex-bourbon and ex-sherry in Spanish oak). Judging by the flavor profile the sherry component is probably on the light side my guess is in the neighborhood of 20%.The whisky is bottled at 40% ABV and retails in the low to mid $40 range at least in California.Update Discontinued in favor of the distillery’s new permanent lineup.Nose Sharp acrid and nutty. The nuts here are odd like nearly-rancid walnuts. At first this is off-putting but it does grow on you. Lemon zest damp hardwood sawdust and a light airy cereal note like dry breakfast cereal. The whole is pervaded by a hard-to-place acidic note in between crushed grape skins fino sherry and grappa. After a rest in the glass dusty golden raisins emerge.Palate Thin bodied. Dry and austere. Faint malty sweetness dusty hay and more grape skins. That weird acidic note returns.Finish Short. Dry and oaky with a bit more sweetness – apricot jam. No bitterness.With Water A few drops of water intensify the hay notes nearly making them barnyardy. They also bring out some hazelnut and more citrus peel. There seems to be more sugar on the palate. You can’t go wrong with a little water here just don’t dilute it too much – stick to drops.Overall Huh. This is an odd duck. Very dry with very little sweetness from either oak or malt. I’d guess a large amount of this malt was aged in refill ex-bourbon if not all of it. It’s certainly priced correctly. I wouldn’t recommend this to a newbie – they might be put off by the hay and grappa notes and the overall dryness – but it does serve as a good value malt to space out the more expensive bottles in your cabinet. Still it’s not a malt I crave. It’s less straightforward – aka more complex – than Glenlivet 12 or Glenfiddich 12 and has less bitterness (a blessing) than Glenmorangie 10. It’s also not nearly as good as The Balvenie DoubleWood 12-year and costs about the same.
441,The Glenrothes Vintage Reserve - Not to be confused with The Glenrothes Select Reserve or the 10 other (!) “Reserve” bottlings from the distillery The Glenrothes Vintage Reserve is an oddball vatting of what appears to be the leftover casks from the last public vintage releases plus a bunch of younger barrels that have not (yet) seen release 1989 1992 1997 1998 2000 2001 2004 2005 2006 and 2007. Of those years the 1998 vintage makes up (according to marketing) 25% or more of the volume. Since this was released in 2015 and probably came from a one-time vatting (that’s conjecture) one could say this is made up of malts 8 to 26 years of age with the 17-year making up a quarter of the bottle. Only the 1992 1998 and 2001 have seen full-scale vintage releases and I guess they must have sold all of the 1995 which is not represented here.The vintages were aged in a variety of casks so this bottling comes from a muddling of ex-bourbon (probably the majority) ex-sherry and refill casks. I was going to make a snarky comment about the irony of putting “Vintage” on the label of a No-Age Statement bottling with no vintage year on it but I guess this technically counts. When it was released in 2015 it was listed in the $45 to $50 range but it appears that recent closeouts have dropped the price as low as $33 at least in California. This puts it in the awkward position of being “more premium” than the Select Reserve and yet costing less. Scotch prices dropping in this day and age? Not a great sign of a quality whisky…Nose Bready (yeasty) with sharp citrus peel notes and an overall sweet orangey vibe. (Unlike many Glenrothes this instantly reminds me of The Dalmore at least the younger ones). The intensity of the citrus notes and the nose tickle combine to almost convey a sense of floor cleaner. Almost.Update Discontinued in favor of the distillery’s new permanent lineup.Palate Medium bodied. Sweet but very grain-forward. Hay banana blanched almonds (marzipan) and a more subdued citrus flavor; like crystallized orange peel. Slightly bitter with a touch of charcoal but not much oak presence.Finish Short. Bready again with a reprise of most of the flavors from the palate. Fades unmemorably. With Water A few drops of water release a torrent of lemon-lime. Zesty. (See what I did there?) The palate is vaguely sweeter but also thinner and more watery (even with only a few drops).Overall This tastes younger than the description would have it that 17 year-out malt is apparently not able to stand up to all of that new millennium whisky. Hallmarks of the house characteristics (nuttiness brown sugar citrus and tropical fruits) are present but one-dimensional and faint. The citrus as appealing as it is over-balances the rest of the experience and the finish is forgettable. At a closeout price of $33 though it’s not a bad value for your dollar and is far better than The Glenrothes Select Reserve Glenlivet 12 and Glenfiddich 12 but doesn’t reach nearly the same bang-for-your-buck as Laphroaig 10 (apples and oranges I know) The Balvenie DoubleWood or even Highland Park 12. This one is certainly not winning any arguments for the NAS crowd. I would not pay full retail for it but I might drop $33 on another bottle for casual sipping.
442,The Glenrothes Whisky Maker’s Cut - Lets get this out of the way first I’m a sucker for a good deal. Show me a reasonably tasty dram for $70 and I’ll shrug and admit that it’s tasty. Show me that same dram for $40 and I’ll trample you down on my way to the register. I won’t even feel bad about it. So when I walk down the aisle at Total Wine today I will see a bottle of The Glenrothes Whisky Maker’s Cut and the price tag under it will say $89.99. That’s a no from me dawg. But rewind to a few months ago when lovescotch.com (that’s not a sponsored link I just thought it would be bad form to put a URL without linking it) ran a brief email promotion on this bottle for $39.99. “What?! Noob?! Why didn’t you tell us?” I have two really good reasons and one really bad one One I didn’t know it was a good deal yet. Two the supply was pretty limited and sold out rather quickly. Three I’m lazy and didn’t even think of it. Anyhoo I bought some and damn quick.A quick note Glenrothes was previously known for slavishly sticking to its vintage-dated release system. They dipped their toe in the NAS waters with the Select Reserve and Vintage Reserve and then scrapped the whole deal and started over the “The Soleo Collection” which is essentially the same as what every other distillery has been doing for two decades plus A core lineup of age-stated malts starting at 10 plus several NAS editions including this one The Whisky Maker’s Cut. I will miss the individuality of the Glenrothes Vintage system especially because uniformity is bad for innovation.The Glenrothes Whisky Maker’s Cut is an NAS (no age statement) release that was matured only in first-fill sherry seasoned oak. Now that’s interesting. It may be the first time I’ve seen a bottle label explicitly spell out the pervasive industry practice of seasoning barrels with sherry (read the comments) and calling them “sherry casks” since real sherry cask are essentially extinct. The distillery website also mentions this practice although without a ton of detail.After aging for an undisclosed period of time the whisky is bottled without added color and at a strength chosen by Glenrothes Master Whisky Maker Gordon Motion 48.8%. He chose that strength because he feels it’s a better ABV than the standards (40% 43% 46%) for specifically sherry-matured malt. Hence Whisky Maker’s Cut. The whisky itself is so dark in color (naturally!) that it’s practically umber. Internet rumors that should not be taken as fact suggest that this first release is around 16 years old but future batches could vary.Nose Piercing concentrated balsamic vinegar. Although acetic there are layers upon layers of jammy and dried fruit notes to balance the tartness. Orange peel bergamot dried pear dried cherry date sherry vinegar and a very faint rancio note in the background. For a lover of sherry bombs like me this is where it’s at.Palate Thin to medium bodied. Sweet upfront with a large dose of mixed berry jam and fig cake. After a delayed and muted tongue burn there are some bitter charcoal/tannic oak flavors that slightly mar the experience. Under that most of the fruit notes (dry now) from the aroma remain.Finish On the short side. The bitter notes carry on along with a little red wine tannin (grape skins) vague nuttiness (raw walnuts?) and then end abruptly with only a ghost of the charcoal left. A slight disappointment.With Water A few drops of water do weird stuff to the aroma bringing out strong oak and tamping down on the fruit. After a rest in the glass the fruit returns sweeter. The palate is much better-balanced and shows a lot more of the expected fruit. The finish is still bitter but less dry. Do this Pour a dram and smell it until you can’t take it anymore. Then add several drops or a small splash of water let it sit 5 minutes and THEN drink it.Overall The aroma on this whisky is to die for with layers upon layers of sherry goodness. Alas the palate is slightly marred by overbearing bitterness and the finish is a little thin and short. You can partially remedy the situation by careful use of water. That shouldn’t be a necessary step to enjoy a single malt especially at the whisky maker’s chosen bottling strength but here we are.This is Recommended with caveats If you’re sensitive to bitter flavors you probably won’t enjoy this. If you like experimenting with adding water to whisky or (like me) will go to great lengths for a good deal in sherried scotch then take the plunge if you find a good price $40-$60 is an amazing price. $60-$70 is a good price. $90 is not. Yeesh.
443,The Ileach Cask Strength - This is one of those “mystery malts” – a brand of single-malt scotch that is marketed as its own entity but which is really repackaged youthful malt whisky from an unnamed distillery. Usually bottling contracts with the mystery distillery preclude the brand from revealing the source to avoid muddying the distillery’s own brand’s reputation. This is quite common as many grocery-store brands (such as Costco/Kirkland and Trader Joe’s Alexander Murray bottlings) are often bottled this way as are some entire brands like Finlaggan. There is always some fun to be had in trying to guess the origin of the juice in these bottles but the result is usually cheaper (and of lower quality) than comparable products that actually state the origin of the whisky.Where these come from is tough to say with much certainty but it’s likely one of three possibilities One that a given brand or bottler established a “filling contract” (an agreement allowing a third party to regularly acquire newly-distilled whisky at fixed or market prices) with a distillery before the modern “whisky boom” shut down most of these programs. Two that partially-aged barrels deemed “unsuitable” for the house brand have been sold to the independent market and resold to bottlers looking for deals. Three that aged stock owned by an independent bottler was acquired through company buyouts mergers or short sales and cannot legally be sold under the original distillery’s name due to the terms of now-invalidated contracts.Also possible in cases of some independently-bottled cheap “blended malt” whisky is that the barrels used have been “teaspooned” with a tiny amount of whisky from another distillery thus preventing its sale as a single malt and precluding the use of the distillery’s name. That’s not the case here. It’s worth noting that both Finlaggan and The Ileach are products of the Vintage Malt Whisky Company which also produces the Cooper’s Choice line of independent bottlings.Bottled at a cask strength of 58% ABV but without any age information The Ileach Cask Strength is a single malt whisky from one of the distilleries on the island of Islay that makes fully-peated malt. “The Ileach” means “the man from Islay” and you could try pronouncing it as “ee-luck” but you’d still sound like a tourist. Just don’t say “Eye Leech”. Ew.Very reliable (that’s a joke that.) Internet gossip says it’s young (5-6 year old) Lagavulin and that the company got a filling contract with Lagavulin before the whisky boom. Other “sources” claim that this and similar bottlings like Finlaggan come from whatever barrels are available (and cheapest) on the independent market and could change from batch to batch. All or none of these things could be true. To me this has a lot of the hallmarks of Lagavulin although it could just as easily be Bowmore or Caol Ila. I don’t think my bottle is Laphroaig but some Internet reviewers have sworn up and down that their bottle was from that very distinctive distillery. That leads me to believe that the “mystery distillery” could be different batch to batch.I tasted a sample that was collected from bottle in October of 2016 as part of a Flaviar sample pack. Unfortunately it appears that The Ileach brand is not available in the United States.Nose Charcoal-flecked smoke-driven peat. Campfire. Iodine. Meaty. Hint of lemon peel.Palate Thin body. Hot of course. Faint lemon. Charred meat. Not much else.Finish Medium-long. Thin slightly acrid smoke. Slight woody sweetness but tarry. Only slightly bitter.With Water Several drops of water increase the lemon note and tamp down the smoke. It also reveals a little youthful grassiness. The palate may be slightly sweeter and a bit livelier as is the finish. Water doesn’t go amiss here but make sure you experience it at full strength first.Overall The peat is pungent and in full force at this proof but there’s little to back it up. Young peated whisky is still young whisky and as strongly as the smoke dominates it fails to hide the lack of character beneath. It probably still does this better than Finlaggan Old Reserve which is unruly and erratic. This at least focuses on the smoke. Personally I’d rather just buy a bottle of Lagavulin or Laphroaig and get something with both individuality AND age. Of course the cask-strength versions of those will set you back so if all you’re looking for is powerful smoke and high proof this could fit the bill.
444,The Irishman Founder’s Reserve Irish Whiskey - I’ve started to wonder if the phrase “Founder’s Reserve” means the owner held back the good stuffTM and released this instead. I kid I kid. Seriously though when the most inexpensive offering from a company claims to be a “reserve” of some sort it strains credulity that the whisky deemed not good enough for this bottling was what… dumped down the drain?The Irishman is a brand of sourced Irish blended whiskey released by the Walsh Whiskey Distillery Ltd. (which is as pointed out in the comments officially distilling as of March 2016 – this bottle is sourced whisky however). Walsh which also sells the very popular Writers’ Tears. Like Writers’ Tears this is actually not a “blend” in the typical sense. It is a mixture of 70% single malt Irish whiskey with 30% single pot still Irish whiskey with no column-still grain whiskey in sight. (Writers’ Tears is 40% and 60% for comparison.) These components are both triple-distilled and aged in ex-bourbon casks. The final product of uncertain age is bottled at the bare minimum 40% ABV.At $28 to $40 a bottle this represents a discount of $5 to $10 off of the price of Writers’ Tears for a different grain profile.Nose Peach marzipan and honey. Bubblegum. Markedly grainy with a hint of grassiness and a little glue / industrial solvents but less so than cheaper blends. The fruit is well-balanced and light and the sweetness is present but not cloying.Palate Syrupy body. Grain-forward like too-young malt whiskey but with more honey and bubblegum. Less fruit than on the aroma but still lightly sweet. Very low tongue burn but a little two-dimensional.Finish Raw honey tropical fruits (kiwi) and a little drying barrel tannin and charcoal bitterness. Fades with dry woodiness and herbal bitters.With Water The addition of a very few drops of water adds banana custard to the aroma and brings out more grassiness on the palate and finish emphasizing its youth. I would skip water with this one.Overall Much better than your typical bottom-shelf Irish blend but doesn’t rise as high as the better malts or pure pot stills like Tyrconnell or Redbreast. Still it has a nice balance of lightly sweet and fruity notes with a mild “green malt” graininess that doesn’t ruin the experience. I think I would personally pay the extra $5 to $10 to snag Writers’ Tears which has a higher proportion of pure pot still or just go whole-hog and get a much better whiskey with an age statement by buying Redbreast 12-year.
445,The Macallan (12 year) - Color Bright AmberNose Sherry peach almond/amaretto golden raisins.Palate Rich bodied big sherry notes of red plums canned apricots and well-aged red wine. The oak is heavily present as well with undertones of vanilla and a sweet sappy freshly-cut-lumber quality. Young sharp and bright tasting although the complexity of the malt is overshadowed by the heavy sherry and oak influences. Not as sophisticated as the older Macallans but shows a decent balance between oak sherry and malt.Finish Long and evolving turning fruity and raisiny.Adding a few drops of water gives the malt a sweeter more enjoyable aroma with a hint of flower pollen. On the palate the water thins the body but reveals flavors of honey rosewater and lighter fruits (banana champagne grapes peaches yellow plums). I highly suggest a few drops of water with your Macallan.
446,The Macallan (18 year) - Note This review was written in 2011 back when Macallan 18 was a bit above $120. Now it’s $240. While the tasting below is accurate I do not believe that Macallan 18 is worth $240 a bottle. At a stretch I would pay $150 in 2016 prices… and mostly only for nostalgia’s sake. Therefore take the below with a grain of salt.The Macallan 18 lies at the intersection of two worlds. On one hand it remains the staple of luxury hotel bars CEO offices and corporate Christmas gifts. Drinking it has become something of a status symbol. When Jessica Simpson ordered a glass of The Macallan 18 at a restaurant in L.A. (over ice.. gah!) it made headlines (not you know USA Today but bear with me here). If a big-time corporate CEO doesn’t know much about scotch but needs to impress foreign investors chances are he pours either The Macallan 18 or Johnnie Walker Blue Label. Usually when a product attains this type of status with “the public” it becomes persona non grata with the anoraks geeks and connoisseurs that make up the rest of the industry. Not so with The Macallan 18. A consistent level of quality combined with a popular (if older) style of cask aging – all sherry all the way – make this dram a standard favorite among even the whisky elite. At WhiskyFest last week The Macallan table was as busy as ever – they were pouring the 18.The only complaint most experts have about The Macallan is that their incredible level of production – 8 million liters of alcohol annually – implies a corporate culture of mass-production. When “efficiency” begins to trump “quality” in the boardroom customers suffer. Whether that’s the case at Edrington or not The Macallan 18 continues to impress.I split this bottle with a friend – purchased in July of 2011 it comes from one of the more recent batches. I remember having a glass from a previous batch early in my whisky education and being blown away by the smoothness and the dark leathery complexity. Today’s Macallan 18 is perhaps a little brighter a little sweeter and just as good.Nose Sherry all the way. The fruit here is bright and juicy ripe red raspberries strawberry preserves quince paste on toasted wheat bread some oaky caramel and hot drawn butter. It’s a beautiful silky nose with pristine sherry character and perfectly aged malt. A few drops of water makes it seem younger bringing a little candy apple and fruit punch.Palate Oaky upfront furniture varnish a little cherrywood peeking through. Unbelievably smooth on the tongue with barely any burn. Mouthfeel is unctuous and medium-thick. Jams and preserves dominate dried figs milk chocolate-dipped dried apricots. A little water dulls the brighter notes muddying the clarity of the flavors somewhat.Finish Medium-long with a bit of cigar tobacco cocoa nibs dried cranberries and a last eddy of woodiness.Overall The beauty of this is in the nose. It’s hard to imagine a more perfect sherry-matured nose the malt integrates flawlessly with the equally flawless sherry notes. Nothing is out of place or weighted too heavily. No leaning towards the rancid fruit nor any suggestion of oak saturation. In the mouth the quality is evident but the number of detectable flavors is limited. The finish while capable doesn’t reveal anything unexpected. Truly a classic dram which continues to be excellent. I suggest skipping the water – this whisky doesn’t need it.
447,The Macallan Double Cask (12 year) - I’ve given Macallan a lot of grief over the years. Long-time readers will be familiar with my love-hate relationship with the distillery or more accurately with its owners the Edrington Group. Lately my two biggest beefs have been the accelerating price increases and the decelerating age statements. So when I saw this Macallan “Double Cask” 12 year-old for $55 I was intrigued. Hmm. A 12 year-old Double Cask. Sound familiar?These days $55 for a partially-sherried 12 year-old single malt with a good name is not a bad price. Contrast this with Macallan 18 currently around $240 and Balvenie DoubleWood 12 currently around $47.This is something new folks. Macallan takes new American oak (NOT ex-bourbon!) and “seasons” it by filling it with sherry for an undisclosed period of time. These “seasoned” American oak sherry casks are then used to age Macallan for at least 12 years. This whisky is then blended with traditional Macallan aged in European oak sherry casks and bottled at 43% ABV for the American market. (It’s worth noting that the UK 700ml presentation of this is 40% ABV. This review applies only to US 750ml bottlings at 43% ABV.) There have likely been others but this is the first time I’ve personally heard of a distillery seasoning new American oak with sherry and then aging scotch in it. That right there is worth the $10 premium over Balvenie DoubleWood.Nose Macallan-esque rancio sherry with dried figs orange peel (although not as much as Dalmore) and walnut meats. Beneath that a multi-layered malt character with honey and bakery treats.Palate Syrupy body. Moderate tongue-burn. Delectable with fruit jam orange blossom honey buttery toasted oak and vanilla toffee.Finish Medium-long. Slightly tart fading into nut butter and marshmallow and ending with only a slight bitter oaky char. A little thin but inoffensive.With Water A few drops of water mute the aroma leaving only a strong vanilla buttercream note. For some reason this continues even after a rest in the glass. I do NOT recommend water with this one!Overall An accomplished satisfying dram from start to finish. At least as much sherry character as former bottlings of the exclusively sherried 12 year-old and far more sherry character than Balvenie DoubleWood. Unmistakably Macallan and it doesn’t leave anything on the table for having been aged partially in American oak casks instead of European oak. Indeed this expression benefits from the extra weight and vanilla nuttiness derived from American oak. Definitely representative of the Macallan name and definitely worth the $55. Here’s hoping we see more affordable innovative whisky from Macallan in the future that does NOT involve the loss of age statements or the use of ex-bourbon casks to “thin out” the Macallan exclusive-sherry house style.
448,The Macallan Fine Oak (10 year) - The “Big M” and I have a love-hate relationship. The Macallan 18 was one of my first favorite malts and The Macallan 12 was one of my first cabinet staples. Since then Macallan’s brand has taken off and been continuously associated with luxury with price increases to match. Four years ago I could buy a bottle of Macallan 18 for $110. Now? It’s $220. I have not considered Macallan to be worth the cost of entry for quite a long time now and the recent “Macallan Colors” debacle has lowered my respect for the brand further. (See my review of The Macallan Gold here)Still it can’t be said that Macallan makes an inferior product. They consistently produce tasty sherry-matured whisky with a very high bar for quality. I can honestly say I have never tasted a Macallan product that I disliked.The Fine Oak series launched in 2004 offered a look at Macallan with some of the sherry stripped away. Like The Balvenie DoubleWood the Fine Oak series is a marriage of traditional Macallan matured in ex-sherry casks with Macallan distillate aged in ex-bourbon. As sherry casks are more expensive than bourbon barrels this allowed Macallan to put out bottlings with a different style that also cost a little less. Initially met with mixed reviews with most of the negative reviews from whisky enthusiasts who saw the line as a “dumbing down” of the previously “purely” sherried malt. I confess having the same opinion before tasting it myself. I thought “Why would I want to have Macallan that tastes a little *less* like Macallan?” Now I have my answer The price.Nose Not the familiar Macallan profile although there is a nutty meaty undertone that reminds me of the flagship 12 year. There are fruit notes here – fig plum etc. – but they are muted secondary to the nutty/malty notes that take the fore. These are the standard array of caramel/nougat/butterscotch and are well represented and unblemished. I can find no fault although there’s nothing exciting either.Palate Thin bodied but nutty – hazelnut butter and walnuts. Some slight resiny sherry notes (again muted and in the background) otherwise an echo of the aroma. Not particularly sweet.Finish Medium-long. Peanut butter fig jam fading without bitterness. Pleasant.With Water A small splash of water wakes up an array of fresh fruit notes (fresh and dried berries) but thins the palate even further. Definitely try this with and without water.Overall A pleasant dram with all of Macallan’s polish and refinement for a very un-Macallan price. As long as you don’t mind missing out on the signature Macallan fruit this would make a reputable daily sipper in the vein of Balvenie DoubleWood 12 (but almost $10 cheaper). This is a Must-Try for anyone with budget in mind.
449,The Macallan Gold (1824 Series) - Oh Macallan. It started with puppy love a flirting with your sherry-bomb 12-year bottling. It was the fourth or fifth single malt to pass my lips and sparked a life-long love of sherried whisky in me as well as a heavy respect for the brand name. Later as my whisky knowledge and experience grew I became passionate about the deep soulful complex voluptuousness of your 18-year bottling. It christened the bachelor party of my own best man Mike and only deepened my love for both heavily sherried malts and The Macallan.Then like 45 minutes into an Oscar-winning drama things started to take a turn for the worse. First you released the “Fine Oak” series… basically stripping my beloved sherry character from your now-tawdry now-cheap house malt and trying to pass it off as “fine”. Next you decide to “premiumize” your brand in the face of growing demand and growing prices doubling the cost of your entry-level 12-year to $60 and my favorite 18-year from $99 to $200. Finally the nail in the coffin of our romance you began systematically removing the age-statements from official bottlings replacing them with (of all the vain face-value book-by-its-cover things) color. Et tu Macallan? *Gasp flounder around the stage die noisily*.Dramaturgy aside I am pretty seriously pissed about the progression The Macallan has taken as a brand. First raising its prices by 100% over a few years in the name of premiumization and then effectively watering down the flagship malts to stretch supplies in the face of demand. Can I blame them? No from a purely capitalistic perspective they’ve done the right thing. In doing so however they have tarnished and even indeed betrayed the loyal customers that made them so popular in the first place. The fact that they’ve handily replaced all of those stalwarts with new customers both domestic and in emerging markets is just the sad reality of the whisky market today and all of my sound and fury about it signifies nothing (see what I did there?). Macallan is not going to say “Oops sorry about that” and start selling 18 year-old malt for $99 a bottle again and I’m just going to have to get used to it.So although the transition is not complete (with 12 18 and older age-statement Macallan still on the shelves in various markets) the new flagship series of The Macallan official bottlings (the 1824 series) goes like this Gold Amber Sienna and Ruby (stupid right?). With the entry-level Gold at $60 a bottle that’s hardly what I’d call an approachable range. Also who the hell knows that the difference between them is based solely on the color? The color is natural yes (not added or manipulated with caramel coloring) but experience has taught us that color means very little when it comes to either flavor or quality. I’ve seen gorgeous shades of autumn colors in quite mediocre whiskies and I’ve seen ugly dirty browns in whiskies that blew my mind with flavor. I’ve also tasted fabulously concentrated gems that looked like white grape juice. Still we’re now supposed to understand that Ruby is better than Sienna which is better than Amber which is of course better than Gold.I should also note that these are not one-for-one replacements with the original age-statement range. Gold tastes nothing like the 12-year. It’s like a mellower version of the Fine Oak 10-year (although Gold claims to be exclusively matured in sherry casks on the label). Ruby is purportedly very similar to the old Macallan 18 and is more-or-less equivalently priced around $180 – $200. Sienna and Amber are somewhere in between. What this all boils down to is that Macallan can now stretch their stocks of 18 year-old malt with 17 16 and younger juice. Sure it’s carefully blended to taste good but nothing changes the fact that we’re getting younger Macallan for the same price.So how’s the Gold actually taste? I’m not even going to bother commenting on the color…Nose Golden raisins (sultanas) up front and center. Peach syrup and marzipan wild honey. Vaguely floral. A swirl of the glass releases a wash of fresh pear cider. Quite sunny and pleasant.Palate Thin body. Very soft with nary a hint of tongue burn. Flavor is mostly cereal – shortbread cookies buttered scones – and the sherry notes only linger around the edges as dried fruits and tanniny grape skins.Finish Short. Honey with absolutely no bitter notes. A little heathery on the fade-out. Simple.With Water A few drops of water (not too many since this is a weak 40% ABV) release a torrent of floral notes – wildflowers honeysuckle rose water orange flower water etc. The palate is mildly sweeter and the finish unchanged. A little water is a good idea with this one.Overall Okay so this is very pleasant single malt whisky. It is light and airy vibrant and youthful (in a good way) and with an array of flowers and fruits that scream “Springtime!” while never becoming cloying bitter or overbearing. That said this is no sherry-bomb. There are no dense red fruits figs currants resin or anything else commonly associated with the older sherried malts (or even GlenDronach 12 which is redolent with these). Tasted blind I would have said it was The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 with perhaps a few fewer years on it.I’m conflicted. I feel like I’m seeing an Ex who has grown fat but nevertheless seems wildly happy without me. The fact that this is NAS the bottom of the range and $60 makes me not interested in purchasing a second bottle. Still it’s a very good mastercrafted single malt and would be an excellent introduction to malts for someone who thinks $60 sounds entry-level.For me it’s a hesitant (and slightly bitter) Recommended.
450,The Macallan Whisky Maker’s Edition - This marks my first taste of a Duty Free (aka “Travel Retail”) bottling. The industry figured out long ago that the best way to make money off of travelers looking to avoid paying duty taxes on alcohol while traveling internationally was not to offer low-cost bottles or offering deals but instead to offer exclusive labels that could only be found in duty-free shops. That way instead of losing margin on travelers looking for a deal they could make an extra profit by selling uniqueness and cachet. This makes Travel Retail a good place to find one-off bottlings interesting finishes and unusual gifts but not a place to find a deal.Walk into any airport or cruise line duty-free shop and you’ll see rows of liter-sized marked-down bottles of vodka gin rum and tequila next to above-average-priced bottles of scotch and bourbon that you’ve never heard of. Still for the whisky enthusiast looking to try a little of everything the world of whisky has to offer duty-free is another avenue to explore.My parents were nice enough to pick up a bottle of The Macallan Whisky Maker’s Edition on the way back from their recent trip overseas. Thanks Mom and Dad! This 700ml bottle with no age statement arrives with basically no information on its label about its make-up or provenance. The Internet has revealed that it is comprised of both ex-sherry (the majority) and ex-bourbon casks and bottled at Distillery Manager Bob Dalgarno’s preferred strength of 42.8% ABV. Why not 43%? Because 42.8% was the original lowest standard proof (75 Imperial Proof) for retail before it was dropped to 40% ABV in 1980. Oddly the bottle’s label doesn’t name Bob at all instead referring to the eponymous “Whisky Maker”. In an effort to harken back to traditional styles of single malt scotch Bob Dalgarno sourced some barrels of Macallan distilled from the now-defunct Golden Promise strain of barley. While the bottle does not state an age it is (according to Bob) comprised of Macallan aged 12 years and up with “some much older”.Honestly I think producers like Macallan are missing a beat by not providing this information prominently on the back of the bottle and on the website. This is the kind of information that sets a $100 bottle of Whisky Maker’s Edition apart from a $40 bottle of NAS malt.Nose Resinous and sharp with piercing notes of blood orange fig and raisin. Typical sherry-driven profile with a lot of dried fruit and a funky twist like the aroma of sour ale. Deep complex and satisfying although the deeper leathery notes of old sherry are missing replaced with tart fruits.Palate Syrupy. Raisins in bread pudding with a haze of caramel. Echoes perfectly the collection of notes from the aroma fully delivering on the promise of the nose. Strength seems “just right” with just a splash of fire up front. Very drinkable at this ABV.Finish Of medium length. Raisins again with some sparkling tart notes (kiwi golden raisin redcurrants) and red wine reduction. Simple but pleasant.With Water If you add water to this let it rest in-glass for several minutes as it initially dampens most of the aroma. After a rest there is decidedly more caramel with added buttercream frosting (vanilla) in exchange for far less fruit and a thinner body. I’d skip the water especially since this 42.8% bottling strength was an intentional choice by Macallan.Overall A satisfying full-flavored sherried malt in true Macallan style. There is clearly a hefty dose of younger (12 year ish) sherried malt given the lack of leather and rancio notes and the prevalence of fruit flavors that come across as fresh instead of dried. Still it’s perfectly well-balanced finishes elegantly and tastes just like it smells (a rarity). As a Travel Retail offering this wouldn’t make for a regular purchase but as a gift or a memento it fits the bill nicely and the price tag is commensurate with current price standards in single-malt scotch (especially with The Macallan name). It’s certainly better than The Macallan Gold.
451,The Quiet Man Irish Whiskey - Some of you might have noticed that I’ve been on an Irish kick lately. This is due in part to my love of Single Pot Still as a category (Redbreast Green Spot Powers John’s Lane etc.) and part to my wife giving me an Irish whisky tasting set for Christmas. 🙂The Quiet Man a new brand partnered with Luxco for distribution is the first Irish whiskey bottled (and soon distilled) in Derry Ireland in more than 100 years. While the distillery is under construction (slated for completion around now early 2018) the brand sources Irish whiskey with a “high” (undisclosed) malt percentage and marries the blend in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels. “Finishing in first-fill bourbon” is something that sounds good on a label and is unusual for a blend but it’s also a pretty minor thing in the scale of single malts that we’re used to. I couldn’t count on two hands the number of single malts that are aged exclusively in first-fill ex-bourbon.As always the source of sourced whiskey is hard (or impossible) to pin down. The malt component is very likely to be from Cooley as the brand’s creator has said it is not made in Northern Ireland (Bushmills). It’s possible that the grain component is also Cooley (Greenore) but that’s conjecture. The first-fill ex-bourbon barrels come from partner Luxco.The Quiet Man is triple-distilled aged for at least (probably exactly) 4 years and bottled at the bare minimum 40% ABV. It retails for a pretty reasonable $23 to $30 which makes it cheaper than The Irishman. The brand also has an 8 year-old single malt which I hope to review soon.Nose Definitely a blend. Grain up front with an interesting zesty lemon-lime high note (lime is not a note I commonly find in any whiskey). Moderate caramel aromas form a base for a round if not deep profile.Palate Thin body. Some young grain notes (glue vodka) offset by a mild oak influence (caramel pecan) and a very tame tongue burn. Certainly easy to drink (aka “Smooth”).Finish Of medium length. Sweeter than expected with vanilla buttercream frosting and hazelnut butter. Lingering with a tinge of coconut and lime peel on the tail end.With Water A few drops of water amp up the nose tickle requiring a rest to calm down. After the rest I don’t detect any changes. Water optional but at 40% I wouldn’t bother.Overall I was prepared to write this off as another sourced blend trying to build a brand name out of somebody else’s whiskey (to be fair until the distillery output reaches bottling age that’s exactly what it is). Still there’s an interesting high note in the aroma a mild baseline of caramel thanks to the finishing in first-fill bourbon and a rather tasty sweet finish. Not too shabby for a blend and it can go toe-to-toe with the big boys any day. The one major flaw I find is the vodka note on the entry which is par for the course with young blends anyway. If found for under $30 you would be hard-pressed to find a daily drinker that beats this. It will be interesting to see how the quality (and price?) are affected when the new distillery’s output comes of age.
452,The Singleton of Dufftown (12 year) - After a reasonably positive experience (especially at this same price-point) with The Singleton of Glendullan 15 year I thought maybe I was heading for the discovery of another hidden gem with this 12 year-old Singleton of Dufftown. There’s also something exhilarating about tasting whisky from a distillery that you’ve never experienced before… a treat that becomes rarer the longer you engage in this hobby. While disappointment (or more likely indifference) is possible at least you can mentally ‘check off’ another distillery.Dufftown is the name of a town in the Speyside region of the Scottish Highlands. The town itself is home to a number of distilleries including Balvenie Glenfiddich Mortlach and others. This means that the name of this particular bottle could be translated as “a single malt made in a town where a lot of other single malts are also made”. I guess that doesn’t ring enough to make the Diageo marketing materials. Dufftown is in fact a small distillery in the town of Dufftown with the official name of “Dufftown-Glenlivet Distillery” which does nothing to alleviate the confusion (it refers to the valley – glen – of the river Livet not the Glenlivet Distillery). The Diageo-owned distillery has six stills and was established in the 1890s. The range includes a number of NAS malts as well as a 15-year 18-year 21-year and 25-year. This 12-year is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon and “European oak” casks which could mean a lot of different things. It’s bottled at 40% ABV.Diageo uses this “Singleton” (which is an out-of-circulation word that refers to a whisky so rare that a broker had only one single barrel in stock) brand to market under-the-radar malts that it owns and is trying to turn into international powerhouses through sheer will (and marketing budget) alone. For some reason known only to the marketing prodigies at Diageo the Singleton brand was launched to aim a different low-visibility distillery at each continent of distribution. That meant The Singleton was Glendullan to North America Glen Ord to Asia and Dufftown to Europe. Apparently they’ve done away with this “strategy” and will be distributing all three Singletons to all markets.I have read – and I’m not sure I believe this – that The Singleton was recently the fifth best-selling brand of single malt scotch in the world. News to me.Nose Bubble gum. Dense fruit punch aromas Red Vines and a hint of anise. A rest in the glass neither adds nor removes anything from the equation.Palate Thin body. Sweet again with the same gum and punch notes. Orange taffy vanilla and cream soda. Negligible tongue burn. Sweet and fruity but lacks complexity.Finish Short. The fruits have become faint but the candy flavors (corn syrup) remain. Fades very quickly without additional notes.With Water The addition of a few drops of water initially shocks the aroma washing out all of the fruit. It comes back slowly and without a noticeable change. The flavor and finish are the same with the addition of a green apple note. Water optional but not needed.Overall The very definition of one-dimensional. This absolutely smells and tastes like alcoholic fruit punch. On the upside there are no off-notes no bitterness and no “paint thinner” notes that often accompany inexpensive malts. On the downside there is a total lack of complexity that aside from the initial fruity surprise leaves the drinker wishing for something more. You can definitely do better at this price-point with the aforementioned Glendullan 15 or even your standard Glenlivet 12 Glenfiddich 12 or Glenmorangie 10.
453,The Singleton of Glendullan (15 year) - Turns out there are still deals to be found in single-malt scotch. I spotted this bottle of Singleton of Glendullan at 15 years of age (an age statement! Glory be!) for $35 and snapped it up. Even bad whisky can go into cocktails for $35 a bottle. Turns out it’s not even bad.The Glendullan distillery is yet another one of those industrial factories that Diageo uses to spit out tens of thousands of liters of whisky every year almost all of which goes into blends. There have been both official and independent bottlings of Glendullan for a long time but they haven’t been marketed or distributed with much effort nor received much attention. Diageo uses this “Singleton” (which is an out-of-circulation word that refers to a whisky so rare that a broker had only one single barrel in stock) brand to market under-the-radar malts that it owns and is trying to turn into international powerhouses through sheer will (and marketing budget) alone. For some reason known only to the marketing prodigies at Diageo the Singleton brand was launched to aim a different low-visibility distillery at each continent of distribution. That meant The Singleton was Glendullan to North America Glen Ord to Asia and Dufftown to Europe. Apparently they’ve done away with this “strategy” and will be distributing all three Singletons to all markets.I have read – and I’m not sure I believe this – that The Singleton was recently the fifth best-selling brand of single malt scotch in the world. News to me.The Singleton of Glendullan is aged in ex-bourbon casks of undisclosed provenance and bottled at 40% ABV. The range includes a number of age-stated expressions. This is the 15 year-old.Nose Lightly malty and strikingly fruit-forward. Kiwi green apple faint coconut and green banana. Not very much depth but also not cloying. Delicate and pleasant. A rest in the glass ripens the banana which begins to dominate.Palate Medium-bodied almost syrupy. Initially sweet with cookie dough and caramel. Medium tongue burn (more than expected for 40% ABV) resolving into slightly bitter charcoal nut butter and marshmallow.Finish Short. Fades with more marshmallow oaky bitterness and some muddy charcoal. Kind of a mess.With Water A few drops of water coax a deeply sweet buttercream vanilla frosting note from the aroma. Now it smells like banana cream pie. The palate seems less distinct and there is more of a bitter walnut note. Try both without and then with water.Overall Reminds me of Glenlivet 15 which is better (and only $3 – $5 more depending on your market). The nose promises light & fruity but the palate delivers sweet and doughy and nary the twain shall meet. The finish is a muddle and doesn’t resolve. Forgettable but inexpensive. You won’t regret dropping $35 but you would regret dropping $50. If you see Glenlivet 15 for the same (or similar) price I’d suggest starting with that one instead.For the combination of price age statement and drinkability this is Recommended.
454,The Yamazaki (12 year) Japanese Whisky - Technically part of the ‘old world’ of whisky producers (including Scotland Ireland Canada and the United States) Japan has around ten active distilleries. Yamazaki arguably the most popular and certainly the first is owned by drinks giant Suntory. You might know Suntory from their sticky-sweet unnaturally-green melon liquor Midori. Yamazaki has made quality single-malt Japanese whisky since 1923. With the wild popularity of scotch in that country it should be no surprise that some enterprising Japanese would set up shop to emulate that venerable liquid. Yamazaki’s malt is made in the traditional Scottish way but is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon American casks Spanish sherry casks and Japanese oak barrels. At 12 years and 43% ABV it competes on a global scale with its inspiration scotch.Appearance Nice color for a whisky – there’s a faint orange hue that is very appealing.Nose Fruit galore – there is a punchbowl of green banana mango honeydew and pear – and a thick layer of pink bubblegum. Subsequent nosings give more and more banana which is starting to verge on overripe. Under all the fruit is a veiled quantity of malt and cereal sugars. Luckily after a few minutes of rest the nose becomes dominated by the bubble-gum note and not the banana.Palate Nicely viscous body and a very mild tongue burn. A touch bitter to start then some banana and toffee and a slight suggestion of old oak.Finish A wave of anise followed by barbeque char burned nuts and bitter lemon. Medium-long.With Water A splash of water opens up some black licorice but doesn’t ameliorate the intensity of the banana notes. It also thins the body. I’d skip the water here.Overall The positive experience of smelling all that fruit was short-lived. I’m not a big fan (as my regular readers know) of banana notes in whisky and they are plentiful here at least in the aroma. Pair that with a lot of bitterness on the finish and you have a whisky that I wouldn’t buy for myself. It actually reminds me of the entry-level Amrut for which I wrote similar notes. Of course plenty of people like those banana notes and don’t mind some bitterness in the finish. To them I would say “Branch out! Try some malt from a whole ‘nother country!”… To the rest of us I say skip it and start your Japanese whisky journey on something else.Note I sampled a 50ml ‘miniature’ for this review. It should be noted that I have not had the best luck with minis in other reviews (especially of bourbon). It is possible that my review is skewed by this fact. Of course since many people use miniatures to “try before buying” they deserve to be judged at face value.
455,Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye 2011 - Thomas H. Handy the legendary proprietor of The Sazerac Hotel in New Orleans and founder of the modern Sazerac Company lends his name to one of the annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection releases. Fittingly his name appears on an explosive cask-strength rendering of rye the ingredient that made his Sazerac Cocktail famous.Every year Buffalo Trace (a subsidiary of the Sazerac Company) releases the much sought-after Antique Collection. Second only to Pappy Van Winkle (another Sazerac holding) in consumer frenzy these releases bring collectors and whiskey geeks out of the woodwork to snap up limited-allocation bottles from local retailers. I was lucky enough to secure a bottle of the 2011 release of Thomas H. Handy straight rye. This was my first-ever BTAC purchase and also my first cask-strength rye at a heady 63.45% (almost 127 proof).After feeling pretty good about myself for snatching one of the coveted bottles I reflected on the phenomenon of limited-allocation whiskey. As with Pappy Van Winkle your geographic location has much to do with your ability to acquire the stuff. In the midwest and northeast US I’ve heard tales of BTAC bottles and even Pappy getting dusty on shelves. Here in Northern CA it generally sells out within hours (if not minutes) and many retailers maintain waiting lists with thousands of names or resort to raffles and lotteries to dispense tiny allocations (sometimes 2-6 bottles per store).Normally I don’t mention the color (whisky pretty much looks like whisky) but this has a particularly beautiful dense auburn color.Nose Unabashedly rye. Pungent – almost smokey – with heavy spice (nutmeg and cinnamon red-hots) cherrywood and cardamom. Underneath there is a layer of deep vanilla. After a rest in the glass there is an unctuous wave of sweet milky coconut wrapped in milk chocolate or caramel. Take some time with the nose on this one – the aromas go deep. A few drops of water draw out the coconut and smooth some of the wilder edges.Palate Full bodied. Intense burn as expected which leaves behind mountains of flavor sticky cherry pie filling fiery cinnamon sour raspberry jam and sweet toffee. A few drops of water tames the burn but also inhibits some of the bigger flavors. A nice hard-candy note emerges with the water.Finish Long and leaves the mouth a bit raw due to the high ABV but there are some nice fading hints of caramel apple bitter almond and big resiny oak. On the tail end a suggestion of grassy raw rye grains.Overall A cinnamon bomb that never lets up. The nose is suggestive and deep but it’s the palate that explodes with fruit and spice. Truly eyebrow-raising this shows what quality can do to elevate the standard flavors of straight rye. Try drinking this *with* a glass of water before you try adding any.
456,Tobermory (10 year) - Tobermory is a distillery located in the town of Tobermory on the Isle of Mull. Positioned geographically between Islay and the Isle of Skye it shares taste elements with both the peaty Islay malts and the rocky salty malt of Talisker. I think it bears the most resemblance however to the Campbeltown distillery of Springbank. The distillery like many has had a rocky history during which it suffered many closures and re-openings. It was briefly renamed as Ledaig distillery in the 1970s. The name Tobermory also adorned bottlings of a blended scotch and later a vatted malt before finally being bottled as a single malt in 1989.Tobermory is mildly peated but only because of the water that runs over peat bogs above the distillery. Tobermory uses unpeated malt. However the distillery also produces a heavily-peated malt named Ledaig. Ledaig’s heavy peat character is derived from both the peated water and peated malt.Nose Yeasty and robust with some dark mushroomy peat and smoldering coals over a layer of butterscotchy malt. The peat has an oily industrial quality not unlike Springbank. A rest in the glass reveals some elements of bourbon cask aging – caramel and vanilla.Palate Medium bodied. Even tongue burn with a nice balance of alcohol to malty sweetness at 46.3% ABV. Here the malt sugars emerge in the form of burnt caramel and assorted cereal notes although the peat becomes a bit muddy.Finish Long and peaty but in an earthy way. More caramel vanilla and barrel char. Not particularly bitter although the fade-out leaves some ashy asphalt notes.With Water Water tames the peat somewhat revealing more vanilla and malt. A few drops can’t hurt but don’t dilute it too much.Overall This is akin to 10 year-old Springbank in many ways – from the earthy “not quite smokey” peat to the industrial oily notes and the emphasis on barrel char. I think I prefer Springbank for its clearer malt character and eclectic complexity. Still this “poor man’s Springbank” isn’t bad for the price and I think the choice of bottling at 46.3% ABV is spot-on. The earthy mushroomy quality of peated whisky is clear despite only coming from the water although it is less prominent than in a fully peated whisky such as those from Islay. At around $55 there isn’t a lot of reason to recommend this 10 year-old. It has been said that Tobermory and Ledaig are better suited to long aging and that the 20+ year-old bottlings are refined and complex. It thus may be worthwhile skipping Tobermory unless you particularly like the oily/mildly peated style and are looking for alternatives to Springbank.
457,Tom’s Foolery (Batch 3) Bonded Bourbon - In an attempt to avoid beating a dead horse I’ve waited until I could taste the latest (batch 3) of Tom’s Foolery Bonded Bourbon before bothering you all again with this topic. To recap I really really really wanted to like the first batch because it epitomizes (to me) what craft whisky is (or should be) all about One man’s passion for craftsmanship and attention to detail overcoming the odds to compete with “big bourbon” on their own turf. I tried so hard to like it that I gave it a followup head-to-head against a similar midwestern bourbon with no better result.I wasn’t going to shell out another $50 for a new bottle nor ask poor Tom to send me some on his dime so all might have been lost had I not received a sample of Batch 3 from a generous benefactor (thanks David!).Unlike Batch 1 Batch 3 consists of a blend of two different casks of bonded bourbon. The first is 75% Yellow Dent corn 13% Winter Rye and 12% 6-Row Barley. The second cask is 51% Yellow Dent corn 32% Winter Rye 8% malted Winter Rye and 8% wheat. The second is unusual due to its combination of malted and unmalted rye and its use of wheat instead of barley for enzymes in a high-rye mashbill. Both barrels are slightly older than 4 years. Okay I have to geek out for a second. The website actually lists details such as the grain mill sources distillation specifics and exact age of each barrel (4 years 3 months and 4 years 5 months respectively). That is some seriously dedicated transparency! *cough* To continue… Together these casks yielded a batch of 466 bottles at 50% ABV (100 proof a requirement for the Bottled-in-Bond label).So can I finally salve my conscience (and simultaneously ease my anxiety about the reliability of my palate) by evaluating Batch 3? I did the following taste-test with a glass of Batch 1 for direct comparisons.Nose Cinnamon and clove. Cinnamon rolls and hot monkey bread. Nice soft round wheat aromas in a delicate (and successful) balance with spicy rye elements – baking spices and drippy pine resin. Anise (cardamom maybe) woodsy and only very slightly suggestive of brown paper bag (wood fibers). After a rest in the glass lemon peel. A lot going on in there.Palate Syrupy body with a medium burn (not bad for 100 proof). Honey up front (candy corn) with flecks of saltwater taffy malty rye notes (marshmallow and malted milk balls minus the chocolate) and pine sap. Nicely balanced and on the dry side so it’s not cloying. Medium amount of wood influence although it tastes like pine not oak (yes I know it’s not a pine barrel).Finish Long slightly warming. Lemony (like scented furniture polish) brown sugar. Fades with drying oaky tannins and no bitterness.With Water Several drops of water initially mute the nose then open up a bit of vanilla frosting. The palate is sweeter but seems to have lost some complexity. The finish also is fuller and has more sweet vanilla and white chocolate but something feels like it’s been lost. Try both with and without water.Overall Hallelujah! While my bottle of Batch 1 is still strongly suggestive of a pine furniture warehouse dissolving in a vat of Mentholatum even side-by-side the difference is remarkable. Batch 3 is complex and robust with a fetching balance of wispy pine notes (like the scent of the air in a pine forest) soft grains and potent spices. This is the bourbon I expected to get the first time around. Woodsy and powerful but also complex and in-balance. When I imagine a hardworking solo distiller making frontier whisky on antique stills from local ingredients I imagine THIS flavor. Now at last I can recommend it.
458,Tom’s Foolery Bonded Bourbon - I wasn’t going to buy this bottle. I tasted it at an event where I tasted a dozen other whiskies with higher price tags and thought it wasn’t very good. Then David OG extolled its virtues on the K&L blog (I rarely disagree with the Two Davids’ superior palates and wide-reaching command of the current state of whisky both domestic and international) and I felt I owed Tom’s Foolery another look. Thus I abused my advertising revenue to drop $50 on a four year-old craft bourbon. Plus tax.Tom’s Foolery is actually made by an Ohio man named Tom (take that modern whisky marketing!). He does this on a pair of pot-stills originally used by the Michter’s distillery in its “for the visitors” micro-distillery the Jug House which was shuttered in 1990. (Alas these stills are now back at Michter’s and Tom is planning future batches of Foolery to come off his new (to him) antique Alembic still). The whiskey is made from a mashbill of 72% corn 12% rye and 16% malted barley and both the “pure pot still” nature and craft “bottled-in-bond” stamp make this product unique. Tom ages his bottled-in-bond Ohio Straight Bourbon in an honest-to-goodness US bonded warehouse (DSP-OH-15011) for four years in new charred American oak barrels. Some reviews claim that the bourbon is then finished in Applejack casks but I can’t find a reliable source for this. Tom’s Foolery Distillery also has an Applejack and a rye.My bottle is #1104 from Batch #1 (which was a total of 1200 bottles now mostly sold out) distilled in Spring 2012. K&L carr(ied) it for $50 but it can be found at retailers closer to its midwest home for $40. Nose Heavy scents of pine and eucalyptus – exactly like barely-aged rye. The effect should be woodsy but is instead antiseptic and piercing. There is little else to discover under that aromatic blanket of pith and menthol although a rest in the glass and some coaxing reveals some nougat.Palate Syrupy body. Medium tongue-burn (not bad for 100 proof). A tasty array of milk chocolate-covered nougat light caramel and almond extract but marred by an echo of that pine sap (or raw cardamom?) note.Finish Long and warming. A good balance between the young-rye pine from the aroma and the sweets from the palate both of which linger. Fades without bitterness with more nutty nougat and a sudden dried fruit sweetness that is almost like fig (or apple skins?). At the tail end of this quite long (for a bourbon) finish one finds the eucalyptus/menthol again.With Water Water alas intensifies the pine sap notes and renders the entire glass indistinguishable from a snifter of Pine Sol. (That’s conjecture for the more literal-minded of my readers as I’ve never personally sampled a snifter of household cleaner. I’m looking at you guy who thinks I eat rotten fruit because I think a certain whisky tastes like rotten banana). Skip the water here or water it down and let it sit for awhile to disperse the volatile esters.Overall A quandary. This smells like a $25 bottle of 2 year-old craft rye but tastes like a malted confection almost scotch-like in its balance of flavors but unquestionably bourbon. It also has a very successful finish woodsy and sweet but without any unwelcome oaky bitterness. I hate to disagree with the Davids but I can’t recommend this one. Still Tom’s Foolery is a craft distillery to watch especially if they can age out some of that piney rye. I just wouldn’t drop $50 on this unless you’re Ohioan and want to show some Buckeye pride.Note that Sku’s review suggests that the “raw” notes (which I interpret as pine sap) largely dissipate after the bottle is opened once and sits for a week or more. The bottle I’m tasting from was opened about a week ago (for a nip) and it hasn’t seemed to help. Worth a shot anyway. If I notice a change in the whisky as the level in the bottle goes down I’ll post an update.Update 9/23/2016 Tom from Tom’s Foolery asked me to take another look at the Foolery and compare it to Wyoming Whisky. Witness the Grudge Match here.Update 10/24/2016 Batch 3 arrived and is from a different mashbill. Does it fix the problems I found in Batch 1? Find out!
459,Tomatin (12 year) - Tomatin is one of those distilleries – once the largest in Scotland – that was purpose-built to produce malt for use as blending stock. Only recently has the boom in whisky appreciation prompted Tomatin to release and market a single malt. The 12 year in the official lineup from Tomatin is aged in ex-bourbon casks and then finished for 6 to 9 months in oloroso sherry casks.Sometimes this oft-repeated “blend fodder to single-malt” Cinderella story is a boon to the marketplace giving consumers access to previously-unavailable excellent malt. Sometimes however whisky that has been engineered for decades to “fill up” a blend with bulk malt might not perform so well as a solo act. Let’s find out…Nose Predominant note of candy apple with undertones of nougat cinnamon fruit punch and breakfast cereal. Standard in a partially-sherried kind of way.Palate Nice density to the body almost silky. Nut skins shredded wheat and dried cherries on a bed of hum-drum malt.Finish Short. Some dried fruit nougat again and a hint of bitterness like over-caramelized sugar.With Water A few drops of water draw out the tart fruits – cranberries sour apple both on the nose and palate. Also some cocktail bitters and marshmallow on the finish. Water isn’t a bad idea here.Overall Underwhelming. There are some nice “sherried malt” effects but nothing stands out as worthy of attention. Forgettable. Of course it’s wisely marketed at the bargain basement price of $23 to $26 which is perfectly in line with its quality. If you’re desperate to find under-$30 malts in a market inundated with price increases you should give this one a look. Then again it probably performs best in a blend.
460,Tomatin Dualchas (or Legacy) - To get something out of the way – in the UK and other markets this NAS Tomatin expression is sold as “Tomatin Legacy” while in the US it’s sold as “Tomatin Dualchas” which is the Scots Gaelic word for ‘heritage’ or ‘legacy’. I guess they caught on that Americans will fall for a romantic-sounding Gaelic name while the rest of the world sees through that. I was going to write about feeling insulted but then I realized that it’s probably true.This bottling whatever its name is the NAS (no-age-statement) entry-level bottling from the Tomatin distillery in the village of Tomatin in the Scottish Highlands. The distillery is owned by the same Japanese holding company that owns the largest distiller of Shochu in Japan Takara Shuzo. Dualchas is vatted from Tomatin single malt aged in a combination of ex-bourbon and virgin (new) American oak casks. The virgin oak is intended to give the under-matured malt component an extra dose of wood extractives especially vanilla. It’s worth noting that a number of American single-malt producers are also using this trick sometimes aging their young malts in 100% new oak to great effect. Dualchas is bottled at a reasonable 43% ABV and retails for an equally-reasonable $25 or so in the US.Touches like the new oak the 43% ABV and the recent upgrade of their 10 year-old standard bottling to a 12 year-old one show that the distillery is making an effort to attract modern malt drinkers who pay attention to such details. I guess it worked on me… or maybe it was the romantic-sounding Gaelic name.Nose Shortbread cookies banana cream. Faint nose tickle. Light malt and creamy oatmeal. Simple.Palate Syrupy body. Sweet up front with malted milk banana pudding and a very low – very soft – tongue burn. Nilla wafers and crème brûlée.Finish Short. Very slightly tannic (drying) and without bitterness. Mild vanilla extract which fades quickly.With Water A few drops of water adds an unfortunate alcohol burn to the aroma and brings out a grassy vegetal note that wasn’t there before. Avoid water with this one.Overall A simple pleasurable confection. Limited in complexity and leaning a little too heavily in the banana direction (a pet peeve of mine) but quite pleasant for only $25 and despite lacking an age statement. If Nilla wafers dipped in banana pudding sounds good to you you will likely enjoy this. If not – there are better single malts for slightly more money (Glenlivet 12 or Glenmorangie 10 for example).An interesting aside I liked this $25 NAS malt much more than I liked the $28 12-year from the same distillery. It could have been a bad bottle or context or any number of other variables or it could be anecdotal evidence that bottles with age statements are not always better than bottles without.
461,Tomintoul (10 year) - Occasionally I’ll be thumbing through the shelves at my whisky shop and I’ll come across a name I’m not familiar with. It’s often a plain bottle and there’s usually only one expression present. I begin thinking “Hey maybe this is a hidden gem that the ‘mainstream’ hasn’t found yet and I could be drinking the next Pappy Van Winkle in a kilt for… -checks the price tag- $34!” Smiling smugly to myself I cart my newfound treasure home and promptly fill a glass. Channeling generations of intrepid explorers before me I open myself to the new experience and take a sip…Bleh. I check the bottle again. Yup it’s a single-malt. Why does it taste like alcoholic wallpaper paste? The spiritous equivalent to dry matzo. It doesn’t taste bad per se it just tastes like nothing. Then it hits me – I’ve duped myself. There’s a reason I’ve never heard of Tomintoul before and a reason the store was still plenty well stocked with the single expression they carried. Feeling like an explorer whose new land of opportunity turns out to be a barren lifeless rock in the middle of the ocean I relegated the bottle to the back of my cabinet with the rest of the “mixing fodder.” Ah well.Tomintoul built in 1965 and now owned by Angus Dundee is a light-bodied Speysider sold with the marketing slogan “The Gentle Dram” – which may be the most lackluster marketing spin I’ve ever seen. The 10-year is aged exclusively in ex-bourbon casks and bottled at the minimum 40% ABV. Process water comes from the Ballantruan Spring.Nose Yeasty/bready. A little on the hot side with some brown sugar dusty dried apricots and nondescript caramels.Palate Medium-bodied with a hint of creaminess. “Gentle” is right – there is no tongue burn to speak of. A nice maltiness complements a hint of oak.Finish Medium-short. Walnut skins some oak tannins and a vanishing caramel sweetness.With Water Water seems to have no effect on the aroma nor on the palate. Take it or leave it.Overall This may indeed be “The Gentle Dram” but even at 10 years of age it leaves a lot to be desired. The usual suspects for a Highland malt aged in middling ex-bourbon casks are present – the typical caramel yeasty bread brown sugar and nuts – but nothing serves to elevate this dram above any other similarly-aged malt. At least at 10 years of age it’s unfortunately forgettable. The 12 year may be a better bet with some oloroso sherry aging behind it and older expressions may condense some of that “gentleness” into some actual flavor. (Or not here’s my review of the 16-year.) For me I say skip the 10 year.
462,Tomintoul (16 year) - Oh man am I phoning these in now. How many of you have wandered through the aisles of your local whisky shop and come across a fetching bottle of Tomintoul 16-year and thought “That’s a dram that I’d like to try!” Likely not many of you. I certainly am only tasting this in order to notch another review. In fact I’ve been spending the week trying to change ad networks due to recent abysmal ad revenues (likely a consequence of GDPR… or at least I’m going to blame it on that) so I didn’t have time to do a “real” review of something actually interesting. (Also I don’t have the energy to come up with an April Fool’s joke…)So with no further ado I give you… Tomintoul 16! Priced where 16 year-old single malts used to be priced it’s bottled at the basement strength of 40% ABV after aging in exciting extremely usual ex-bourbon barrels.Nose Very shy – allow it to rest for awhile in the glass to open up. Piney like sawn pine branches. Tart apples and spicy anisette. Quite floral although I can’t place the flower. Deep in the glass is a suggestion of white peaches and raw honey.Palate Medium bodied although the flavor seems a too watered-down at 40%. Raw honey again complete with the comb. Toasted oats slight wood and not bitter.Finish Short. Minty with licorice and menthol. Evolves into a reprise of the white peach and honey from the aroma and then fades quickly.With Water A few drops of water brings more of that white peach to the front along with green tea. Alas it seems to drown out the other notes. The water also makes the palate thinner and even more watery perhaps even bland. If you use water use it sparingly.Overall A tasty easygoing malt that has been murdered by the addition of far too much water. By God this should be 46% at least. The fact that it has been waterlogged – indeed drowned at 40% ABV – should be ruled a crime against Man and Whisky. For shame. For what it’s worth it’s a sight better than the Tomintoul 10-year and definitely worth the extra cash if you’re one of the two or three Tomintoul fans out there. (Cue the two or three angry comments.)At 46% with this flavor profile I could heartily recommend this. At 40% I cannot.
463,Tormore (12 year) - A wide range of little-known or largely unavailable single malts dot the whisky marketplace. These producers sometimes seen only on the labels of independent bottlers were generally built for the sole purpose of generating easily-blended single malt to feed the huge demand of blenders making blended scotch whisky. It has only been recently that grassroots (and sometimes market-driven) interest in the origin and individuality of single malts have driven these malts into the spotlight. Tormore for example is owned by Chivas Brothers which markets a 10-year and a 12-year official bottling. However the distillery does not have a website nor a visitors’ center. Despite current hype about single malts Tormore continues to largely produce malt whisky for blending into Long John Ballantine’s and other blends. In my quest to try every affordable single-malt on the market I obtained a sample of the 12-year Tormore to see if it could stand alone.Nose Honeyed and redolent of spring fruits – peach green apple and lychee. Simple but mouth-watering. A very slight nuttiness underlies the fruit and very little wood influence.Palate Nutty. Hazelnut butter and vanilla. Light fruits – white peach – and a dose of barrel tannin that’s on the bitter side. On second taste there’s something buttery mid-palate like Scottish shortbread cookies.Finish Medium-short. A bit grainy with some grassy new-make and a continuation of that bitterness from the palate but it is in balance.With Water A few drops of water improves the palate with added notes of caramel and a dilution of that bitterness. Definitely add a splash of water despite the already low ABV.Overall A few more years and a bottle strength of 46% ABV would do wonders for this malt. The nose is straightforward but delectable. The palate is somewhat washed-out and the finish suffers somewhat from its youth (or lack of heavy wood influence). This isn’t a malt to impress at this age but it shows promise of complexity in its future. I’d love to try an independent bottling of Tormore with a bit more age (16?) higher proof (46%) and without chill-filtration. The 12-year if you can find it is only $35 or so which is certainly a respectable price for a light refreshing dram.
464,Trader Joe’s Highland Single Malt (10 Year) - Trader Joe’s via independent-bottler-to-the-Big-Box-stars Alexander Murray has released a few interesting whiskies (and a few duds) and generally has decent prices on various types of whiskies for a grocery store anyway. Recently while looking for Speyburn 10 (which they didn’t have anymore) I saw this bottle of undisclosed-distillery 10 year-old from somewhere the Highlands (which describes like most of them) which has been “matured in oak casks” like… all of them… It’s 10 years old bottled at 40% ABV and costs $20. That’s pretty much all anybody knows about it.Nose Very floral. Apple blossom filtered honey white peach green tea. The aroma is very light though and has a note of acetone. Reminds me of Dewar’s.Palate Thin body. Dried apple flesh marzipan and vaguely waxy honeycomb. Very little maltiness.Finish Fleeting with a faint nuttiness and a reminder of the acetone. A little bitter on the fade-out.With Water Water heightens the acetone notes and actually makes the dram smell watery (imagine that!). Seriously though it now smells like bad tap water. Avoid the water with this one.Overall Not terrible. The floral character is present throughout and the overall effect is light subtle smooth and pleasing. For the money this is at least as good as Speyburn 10 and won’t be a disappointment unless you’re looking for big flavor. Easy to sip certainly capable of mixing. Still I’m going to mark it “Try Before you Buy” not because I think you should seek out a glass before “investing” your $20 but rather that you should consider the $20 purchase as a trial run. It’s cheap enough for that. If you hate it drown it in orange juice and Cherry Heering. Actually I’ll bet it would make a pretty passable scotch highball (aka scotch and soda).Now if only we knew what distillery this comes from! At first I thought it might be Clynelish but there aren’t enough waxy notes. Instead my best guess is Aberfeldy. We’ll probably never know.
465,Trader Joe’s Highlands Single Malt 12 year (2003 – 2015) - Trader Joe’s via independent-bottler-to-the-Big-Box-stars Alexander Murray & Co. has released a few interesting whiskies (and a few duds) and generally has decent prices on various types of whiskies for a grocery store anyway. Yes this is my standard intro for Alexander Murray reviews now.I saw this one plus a 13 year-old Speyside malt each for $30 and snagged both. While neither label gives any hints about the distillery (par for the course with Alexander Murray) the Trader Joe’s Fearless Flyer spilled the beans on both bottles by revealing the distillery locations. This one located “on the banks of the River Teith” can only refer to Deanston. Note I’ve chosen to release both tastings today so if you missed the other one click the link.You might remember me disliking Deanston Virgin Oak. After tasting this one I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Deanston can be light crisp grassy and with a vague waxiness reminiscent of Clynelish.At any rate this is (probably?) an ex-bourbon single malt from the Deanston distillery. (The bottle says “Matured in Oak Casks”. Duh.) It was distilled in 2003 and bottled in 2015 at 40% ABV after 12 years of aging. Deanston’s official releases are bottled without chill-filtration but there’s no telling what Alexander Murray chose to do when bottling this. I found it at Trader Joe’s in California for $30.So you’d think that two different bottles priced equally released by the same independent bottler at the same time and with (almost) the same age would be of roughly the same quality. The labels are even so similar that they’re hard to tell apart! But no where the 2002 Speyside (Glen Moray) is bland bitter and unappetizing this 2003 Highlands (Deanston) is light sweet crisp and super drinkable. To me this is a parable. You just can’t go by the label the price the age or anything else on the outside of the bottle. You just have to try the damn stuff to see if it’s any good. Good thing you all have me to do it for you. 🙂 (I’m kidding – go try them for yourself and see if I’m wrong.)Nose Grassy cream and beeswax. Candied lemon peel fresh ginger honeysuckle. Pleasant.Palate Thin body but with a slightly waxy texture. Sweet with golden raisins vanilla buttercream frosting marshmallow and honey. Simple and easy to drink.Finish Short. Herbal tea with lemon. Fades simply but without bitterness.With Water A few drops of water wake up green banana notes in the aroma but without much else. I would avoid water here for fear of thinning it out even further.Overall Sunny and pleasant with some welcoming sweet notes some delicate fruits and flowers and nothing bitter or off-putting. Not much depth certainly and the 40% ABV bottling strength spreads what complexity there is woefully thin but one could easily sip through several glasses of this without much trouble. Definitely worth $30 and with that nice waxy note I’d even say it was worth $40. This was a well-chosen barrel although I’d have gladly paid $40 for a 46% ABV version.
466,Trader Joe’s Single Malt Irish Whiskey - Trader Joe’s carries a number of interesting whiskies in the US states in which it has the legal ability to sell liquor. It carries the value peated dram Finlaggan which despite its youth is a fine fiery peated single malt scotch at an unbelievable price. I thus jumped at the chance to pick up a bottle of their new Single Malt Irish Whiskey. The bottle states that this is double-distilled single malt whiskey made in Ireland by “an independent family-owned distillery in County Louth Ireland.” That leaves no doubt whatsoever that this 4 year-old (or so) malt comes from Cooley which is not only the only independent distiller in Ireland todaybut also the only family-owned distiller AND one of only two makers of Irish single malt (Bushmills is the other). Oh yeah and Cooley is located in County Louth. Cooley also makes Tyrconnell and Connemara both Irish single malt whiskeys.Update 12/28/2014 Note that Cooley is no longer independent. It was purchased by Beam Global in 2014.This particular malt is bottled at 40% ABV and retails (at my Trader Joe’s) for a round $20. If you like good whiskey on the cheap go stock up on this one now.Nose Lemon oils and tangerine. Grassy mild peat somewhat herbal. Glue. Undertone of toasted cereal grains.Palate Medium-bodied. This is no pure single pot-still product. Lightly citrusy with some slight smoke like smoldering wet grass and citronella candles. Toward the end nutty hazelnut butter and toasted almonds and a bit of bitter charred wood.Finish Lingering. Lemon pervades fading into walnut skins charcoal spent ashes and a bit more bitterness.With Water A drop of water perfumes the nose bringing some more delicate notes. It also smooths out some of the rough edges on the palate. The added water is an improvement.Overall For the price this is eminently drinkable straight. Certainly it’s not going to win any awards but with a pleasant lemon nose nutty/cereal on the palate and no “cheap blended” aspect in the finish this is an easy value. It’s not as elegant and well-balanced as single-malt scotch nor is it as flavorful and textural as single pot still Irish whiskey but it straddles the line and provides an inexpensive alternative to a palate weary of both. Sku theorizes that this is a vatting of the malts Tyrconnell and Connemara and I think he’s likely right.
467,Trader Joe’s Speyside Single Malt 13 year (2002 – 2015) - Trader Joe’s via independent-bottler-to-the-Big-Box-stars Alexander Murray & Co. has released a few interesting whiskies (and a few duds) and generally has decent prices on various types of whiskies for a grocery store anyway. I saw this one plus a 12 year-old Highland malt each for $30 and snagged both. While the label does not give any hints about the distillery (par for the course with Alexander Murray) the Trader Joe’s Fearless Flyer spilled the beans on both bottles by revealing the distillery locations. This one located “on the banks of the River Lossie” can only refer to Glen Moray (although Glenlossie/Mannochmore comes close). This bottle came from a batch of barrels (1500 cases made means 9000 bottles means 6750 liters at 40% ABV means roughly 4500 liters at cask strength means somewhere in the neighborhood of 22-25 ex-bourbon barrels). Note I’ve chosen to release both tastings today so if you missed the other one click the link.I can only guess that a batch of Glen Moray was deemed too nasty to participate in current owner La Martiniquaise’s Label 5 blended scotch brand and instead sat around for another couple of years reaching the ripe old age of 13 until Alexander Murray came calling.The Glen Moray is aged in ex-bourbon casks. (The bottle says “Matured in Oak Casks”. Duh.) It was distilled in 2002 and bottled in 2015 at 40% ABV after 13 years of aging. I found it at Trader Joe’s in California for $30.So you’d think that two different bottles priced equally released by the same independent bottler at the same time and with (almost) the same age would be of roughly the same quality. The labels are even so similar that they’re hard to tell apart! But no where the 2002 Speyside (Glen Moray) is bland bitter and unappetizing this 2003 Highlands (Deanston) is light sweet crisp and super drinkable. To me this is a parable. You just can’t go by the label the price the age or anything else on the outside of the bottle. You just have to try the damn stuff to see if it’s any good. Good thing you all have me to do it for you. 🙂 (I’m kidding – go try them for yourself and see if I’m wrong.)Nose Faint orange peel. Nutty nougat. Otherwise a pretty standard malty ex-bourbon aroma (cereal grains faint vanilla etc.).Palate Thin body. Marzipan. A little bitter (wood char) but mostly bland.Finish Short. Oaky and nutty. Not much sweetness or individuality. Fades with a bitter note (like rancid walnuts).With Water A few drops of water add nothing interesting to the aroma nor the palate. They might make the finish a little more crisp. Maybe.Overall Bland and somewhat bitter. Not a successful malt. This should probably not have been saved from the mountain of “blending fodder” barrels for which it was no doubt originally destined. There are no redeeming florals fruits or even cloying sweets. Instead it mostly just tastes like insipid wood and alcohol. If you’re standing in a Trader Joe’s on a smartphone right now trying to make a decision I’ll make it for you Get the 12 year-old Highland (psst! It’s from Deanston) instead.
468,Trader Joe’s Speyside Single Malt 18 Year (1993) - So in this age of rapidly climbing prices on single malts imagine my surprise when I see an 18 year-old independently bottled Speyside single malt at Trader Joe’s in San Jose CA for $27. What?! $27? As is common in these situations the independent bottler (in this case Alexander Murray & Co.) is prohibited from printing the origin of the barrel on the bottle and so just indicates that the whisky is from a single distillery in Speyside. We’ve seen this before with Finlaggan a Cooley from Trader Joe’s and some Kirkland (Costco) bottlings. Because of this the label is sparse on details but we know that this is 18 year-old single malt from Speyside distilled in 1993 and bottled (probably) in 2011 at 40% ABV. Let’s see what’s going on with this rock bottom price.Nose Yeasty bread green apple juice and skins vanilla. Pale unripe fruit and mild cereal grains. Very slight florals. Simple and mellow.Palate Medium-bodied. Yeast again – somewhat cardboardy (new word!). The fruit is missing here – only thin grains and water. What I wouldn’t give for another 6% ABV.Finish Slight tannins and some bitterness. Charcoal green grass.With Water A few drops brings freshly-cut crass and assorted aromatic botanicals to the nose at the expense of the green apple notes. It reveals some needed sweetness on the palate – unripe pear? – and tames (somewhat) the bitter finish. Paradoxically this already well watered-down dram benefits from a little more water. Who knew.Overall At a blind tasting I would call this as a 14 year-old Glenlivet from a refill bourbon barrel. The green apple skin on the nose is usually a dead giveaway (for me) of a Glenlivet. Alas this pales in comparison to the official Distillery Bottling 18-year. This was probably a cask destined for blending that got waylaid by an optimistic independent bottler. It’s not hard to see why this barrel was marked down to such an extreme extent although $26 retail a bottle for an 18 year-old scotch (after the costs and hassle of US bottling and distribution) may actually be a loss for the original producer. The promising nose is betrayed by a near-total lack of flavor on the palate and a lackluster finish. Bottling this at cask strength perhaps would have saved its dignity but at 40% it has fallen mostly apart. However it is extremely difficult to get a drinkable scotch under $30 in the current market and despite its faults this could easily serve as a “third round” scotch or sacrificial bottle for undiscerning visitors. I would say this particular bottle is worth exactly $26. Right on Mr. Trader Joe.Note The rating below is not intended to scare away potential buyers but I would not recommend the dram on its quality alone. At this price though it only has to be drinkable to be worthwhile and it’s drinkable.
469,Treaty Oak “Ghost Hill” Texas Bourbon - Treaty Oak is a Texas distillery founded in 2006 near Austin with a story so familiar that I’m getting tired of repeating it on this blog. An upstart distillery not enough startup capital long time to wait for whiskey to age blah blah blah. These guys added a clever twist by branding their “get sourced whiskey to pay the bills” bottlings under the “Red Handed” moniker. In other words they stole somebody else’s whiskey. Yuk yuk. Thankfully this review is of a “grain to glass” bottling of the distillery’s own output called Ghost Hill.I reviewed the Red Handed Bourbon in a previous post with the same opener (sue me I’m lazy). I liked the bourbon quite a bit. The rye (which sports a 10 year age statement) I found to be less successful.I’m a sucker for nerdy whiskey facts so I was excited to see the fact sheet that arrived with these samples. Ghost Hill is a “wheated” Texas bourbon at 2 years of age using 53% Texas No. 1 corn 36% Texas wheat and 11% American barley all milled at nearby Barton Springs Mill. The corn and wheat are heirloom grains grown by Texas farmers. The grains are mashed fermented distilled barreled aged and bottled on-site at the company’s ranch in Dripping Springs Texas. The distillery uses filtered local limestone water. Because the warehouse is not temperature-controlled the wide temperature swings of Texas weather lead to a more rapid extraction of wood flavors leading to a rapid maturation process. The climate is different in Texas than in Kentucky (and especially Scotland). After some experimentation the distillery settled on the use of American white oak #3 char barrels and bottles at 47.5% ABV (90 proof).Nose Taffy and buttercream up front sweet wheat dinner rolls honey anise and a persistent green-grassiness. Sweet and unmistakably wheated. A rest in the glass makes it even sweeter and picks up some sticky caramel notes.Palate Silky full body. Sweet up front as well although it’s a tad hot even for 47.5% ABV. After the burn some nice deep oaky sugar notes maple candies raw honeycomb and resiny fresh-hewn oak emerge. Finish Medium-long. Oak tannins abound and the finish is far drier than I expected. A hint of charcoal and toasted white bread. Fades without evolving.With Water Several drops of water bring out grainy grassy and paint-thinner notes. If you add water you’ll want to let these dissipate. After a rest a new vanilla note seems to have washed out the rest. It does make the finish sweeter. Water does some weird stuff here – I’d avoid it.Overall A different animal than the brand’s sourced Red Handed Bourbon. The DNA of the wheat shines through in all elements except the finish which is oddly dry. There is a little more herbal grassiness than I like to see which implies to me that more aging is needed. I think this shows that the distillery’s own output has inherent qualities that will lead to success down the road. As this is craft whiskey distilled in-house the $40 price tag is acceptable (even laudable as some new distilleries are seeking $60 and up for young own-label bourbon).I’d like to see this take another two years of aging to shave off that grassy quality and deepen the finish so I’m excited to experience future whiskies from Treaty Oak. Until then this is a “Try Before Buy” because I don’t have a “You’ll only be out $40 if you don’t like it and can put it in cocktails anyway” category. The icon wouldn’t fit.
470,Treaty Oak “Red Handed” Bourbon - Treaty Oak is a Texas distillery founded in 2006 near Austin with a story so familiar that I’m getting tired of repeating it on this blog. An upstart distillery not enough startup capital long time to wait for whiskey to age blah blah blah. These guys added a clever twist by branding their “get sourced whiskey to pay the bills” bottlings under the “Red Handed” moniker. In other words they stole somebody else’s whiskey. Yuk yuk. Thankfully there is also a “grain to glass” bottling of the distillery’s own output called Ghost Hill now reviewed here. The distillery also has a sourced 10 year-old rye.For now we have a blend of two sourced whiskies from Virginia and Kentucky. Another twist no MGP! The first is a 2 year-old bourbon from the O.Z. Tyler distillery in Owensboro Kentucky with a mashbill of 70% corn 21% rye and 9% barley. The second is a 4 year-old bourbon from Davis Valley Distillery in Virginia with a mashbill of 66% corn 14% rye and a hefty 20% barley. These are both aged in new American oak (they’re bourbon after all) and the marriage is bottled at 95 proof (47.5% ABV).Let’s pause here for a second and analyze those two components. The first is from another upstart distillery whose first bourbon hit shelves in April of 2018. Alarmingly that bourbon is “fast-aged” with TerrePURE. Here’s how I view that particular fresh Hell. Thankfully I have confirmation from Treaty Oak that the O.Z. Tyler component is traditionally-aged in oak and was not subjected to the TerrePURE process.The second component is from a little Virginia distillery that makes moonshine (of course) vodka and several whiskies.Treaty Oak is in the middle of an expansion looking to market its products beyond Texas. Thanks to Aaron at Ro-Bro Marketing for the samples!Nose Papery with an initial waft of smoke and black pepper. A wide (or “round”) aroma profile of dry corn husks wood chips black licorice and a slight ashy fungal note. Not sweet. It takes a rest in the glass to reveal some lively notes of peach and nougat. Definitely give this some time to open up.Palate Medium bodied with a medium tongue burn (not bad for nearly 50% ABV). Palate notes seem shyer than the aroma but include cherry wood maraschino cherries and (finally!) a raft of rye spices… principally cinnamon. There is also a continuation of the black pepper and licorice from the nose.Finish Of medium length. Ashy again with a mouth-drying oaky tannin and faint honey and corn-syrup. Fades with a ghost of candied cherries and menthol and totally without bitterness.With Water Several drops of water bring out some grassiness along with a strong suggestion of rye grain that continue from the aroma through to the tongue where it thins the body. Water doesn’t hurt anything here but really doesn’t add much either.Overall This is indeed something different. Drier than most bourbons and with an interesting set of wood notes that lean towards the smoky. A rest in the glass adds some much needed balance in the form of fruit and light sweetness. The whole is very dry though which I appreciate. At $40 it’s priced a little high. However it appears that deals down into the $30 range are available. I’d be satisfied to pay $30 for this.
471,Treaty Oak “Red Handed” Rye (10 year) - Treaty Oak is a Texas distillery founded in 2006 near Austin with a story so familiar that I’m getting tired of repeating it on this blog. An upstart distillery not enough startup capital long time to wait for whiskey to age blah blah blah. These guys added a clever twist by branding their “get sourced whiskey to pay the bills” bottlings under the “Red Handed” moniker. In other words they stole somebody else’s whiskey. Yuk yuk. Thankfully there is also a “grain to glass” bottling of the distillery’s own output called Ghost Hill now reviewed here.I reviewed the Red Handed Bourbon in a previous post with the same opener (sue me I’m lazy). I liked the bourbon quite a bit. The rye has a bit higher ABV at 50% and an actual age statement at a resounding 10 years. That’s pretty high for rye in the current market. A bit of digging revealed that this rye is from the Schenley distillery at a mashbill of 53% rye 39% corn and 8% barley. I spent a little too much time researching this as the name Schenley is both a storied name in American whiskey and also awash with confusion. After reading here and here and elsewhere I gave up and asked the producer. This is in fact Canadian-made rye whisky distilled at the Schenley plant in Quebec. It could be related to Golden Wedding or OFC two brands produced at that facility. It could also just be industry contract juice with no particular relevance to other brands. There is precious little info about the Quebec Schenley plant.Treaty Oak is in the middle of an expansion looking to market its products beyond Texas. Thanks to Aaron at Ro-Bro Marketing for the samples!Nose Woah that’s some potent whiskey. Cotton candy and fruit punch fresh green apple lemonade and a waxy note that could be beeswax or could be Pledge floor polish.Palate Thin body. Very hot even for 50% ABV. After the burn subsides there is a reprise of some of the sweet/fruity notes from the aroma plus bubblegum.Finish Medium-short. More of the same (it’s consistent I’ll give it that). Finishes downright tart like sour candy.With Water A few drops of water – for some reason – seems to mute the aroma adding only a faint rosewater note. I suggest saving the water unless you find it too hot for your liking.Overall 10 year-old rye is in short supply in the market these days (hence the inflated price) but I’m not sure how sold I am on this one. Some of the candy notes are very similar to bottom-shelf bourbons I’ve had like McAfee and Rebel Yell and there’s an utter lack of the kinds of spices one associates with rye. Still if you’re able to sort out the Schenley mystery or if these kinds of sweet and fruity Canadian-style ryes are your thing this might be a diamond in the rough.
472,Tullamore Dew Original Irish Whiskey - Tullamore Dew a blended (meaning it uses unmalted grains distilled via column still as well as a small amount of pot-still spirit) Irish whiskey is a common sight on the bottom-shelf of liquor stores. The name evokes verdant green glens dripping with misty Irish rains and delightful bearded characters sipping local spirit from brown ceramic jugs. Unfortunately it turns out (at least via the sample I tried) to be more mass-market industrialized “fast-food” whiskey suitable only for mixing. At the price point this is certainly the intention of Irish Distillers makers of the excellent Redbreast and Jameson as well as Tullamore Dew (which is distilled at their New Midleton distillery while the brand is currently owned by William Grant & Sons).Nose Ripe and pungent. Upfront there is rubbing alcohol and banana. A little green fruit (apples unripe pears) gives way to dusty hay. A dash of water dulls the nose.Palate Round and sugary with an initial dose of light brown sugar root beer corn syrup and cola. A dash of water brings out some banana and makes it palatable but does little to elevate the muddy sugary flavors. The brand calls this “distinctively smooth” as it’s not particularly rough but the flavors aren’t well-integrated and none of the maturity of oak or malt shows through.Finish Medium-length overripe banana peel malted milk and more stale cola.Overall While there is a hint of the oily savory quality apparent in nicer Irish whiskies like Redbreast the column-still grain whiskey in this blend is young brash and has too much of that rotten banana flavor – perhaps a consequence of sulfur in the barrels or maybe a bad batch of miniatures (a common experience for me lately). There is nothing balanced or interesting in this and a few drops of water don’t help. I would suggest using this one for mixed drinks only.
473,Tullibardine (Alexander Murray: Polly’s Casks) - I have two minds about independent bottler Alexander Murray. Originally they were the masterminds behind the quite excellent Trader Joe’s and Costco/Kirkland single malt bottlings. These were quite-good vattings at mass-market scale listed at very attractive prices. That’s a great way to build a brand and Alexander Murray has capitalized on this success by expanding into more traditional independent bottler territory. You can now find Alexander Murray single-cask bottlings as well as experimental series such as Bon Accord and Polly’s Casks. I say “two minds” because while I very much appreciated getting 20 year-old sherried single malt for $50 I have not loved some of the more recent stuff with the Alexander Murray name on it.This bottling is a “Double Cask” vatting of Tullibardine single malt using both ex-bourbon casks as well as “Double Barrel Ale” beer casks from California brewery Firestone Walker. I went to college nearby Firestone Walker’s central coast brewery and have fond memories of their beer… I still drink a lot of “805”. The Tullibardine that was finished in the ale casks spent 1 year there but we don’t know the full ages of the components. Interestingly those ale casks – 60 of them – were shipped across the Pacific ocean to be filled with Tullibardine and matured in Scotland. The name “Polly’s Casks” refers to David Walker’s wife Polly who coordinated this collaboration.The vatting is bottled at a bare minimum of 40% ABV and originally retailed for $100 although it’s now available for closer to $60 at some locations. I would probably not have risked $100 on a no-age-statement independent malt from a little-known distillery but as this was one of the choices available to me with my Flaviar subscription I grabbed a bottle.Nose Classic Highland malt with hints of hay and unripe stonefruit (think crunchy peaches). At 40% ABV the nose tickle is so slight that it almost SMELLS watered-down. A ghost of lemon peel is the only other note I can tease out. One-dimensional verging on bland.Palate Thin body. Sweet with a clear honey note. Almost nonexistent tongue burn but isn’t as watery as I feared. Malty cereal notes and a little oaky vanilla and that’s about it. No off notes.Finish Short. A bit of minerality sneaks in but mars the sweetness with a metallic twang. Fades quickly leaving only a little oak tannin behind and something bitter that could be hops from the ale casks but it could also be my imagination.With Water A couple of drops of water bring a new pear note which was sorely needed. It is however fleeting. The palate sparkles a little more. Add a few drops of water if you find this bland but not too much lest you dilute it.Overall I had higher hopes for the ale casks which are nowhere to be found. Instead we have the most basic possible Highland malt with no frills and more than a few hints of excessive youth. Whereas the better ex-bourbon Highland malts are adorned with fruits flowers and other subtle touches… this has none of those things. A disappointment.Let’s talk for a moment about disappointing bottles. First I’m very glad I used my “sunk costs” from my Flaviar subscription to get a bottle. Not only did it lower the average price of a bottle (which after paying upfront for the annual Flaviar subscription works out to around $40 depending on how highly you value the 50ml tasting kits)… but the subscription also gave me the freedom to experiment with something I might not have ordinarily purchased off the shelf.Next I think this is a good time to bring up my friend David Driscoll’s approach to home blending which is very well-suited to dealing with unfortunate bottles. The other night I poured a glass of this Tullibardine and topped it off with about 20% of the Lagavulin 9 year that I got on closeout recently. The peat from the Lagavulin nicely covered up some of the youthful off-notes in the Tullibardine while adding some much-needed interest. The Tullibardine in turn bulked out the Lagavulin with some body and extra cereal notes. The combination is definitely better than either malt individually. I’m actually looking forward to blending in some other bottles that have been languishing in my cabinet to see what else I can create.
474,Tullibardine 500 Sherry Finish - Tullibardine located in the heart of the Scottish Highlands in Perthshire began distilling in 1949. Like most Scottish distilleries it spent a period of time mothballed in the nineties and changed hands several times. It is currently owned by French company Picard Vins & Spiritueux the firm’s only distillery. Also like many whisky brands trying to reinvent itself in the modern era the bottles have undergone a redesign in 2013 and the core range is now stocked with NAS expressions including the 225 (Sauternes finish) 228 (Burgundy finish) and this one the 500 Sherry Finish. The company also bottles a 15-year and several older age-stated expressions.The 500 Sherry Finish is matured for an undisclosed period of time in first-fill bourbon casks before being filled into 500-liter (hence the name) Pedro Ximenez sherry butts for one year. The final whisky is bottled at 43% ABV and is both chill filtered and (probably) has added spirit caramel for coloring. (Sigh.)Nose A piercing vinegar note – like an expired wine – with a significant sulphur note. Dry acidic and with the fruit notes (green apple pear lemon) marred by the vinegar. There is a very thin layer of almost-sweet malt which is hidden below the weird wine notes.Palate Syrupy body. Much sweeter on the tongue with a nice pear drop flavor lemon peel and white cherries. The malt is still far in the background. There is also a suggestion of blanched almonds.Finish Medium-long. Still acidic but the sweetness is in better balance now. Raw wildflower honey pale malt and not even a hint of bitterness. Fades slowly without evolving further.With Water A few drops of water don’t seem to help matters but combined with a rest in the glass the situation improves There is a lot more sweetness (vanilla) and a lot less sour wine. If you have a bad initial experience like I did definitely try adding some water and five minutes of rest time.Overall Huh. This would be a passably interesting single malt if it weren’t for the severely off-putting vinegar / sour wine notes on the aroma. I’m not usually one to notice sulphur notes in whisky but even I couldn’t escape it here. Things improve once you get the liquid past your nose but the experience is unalterably dampened by that point. This could be a personal taste thing and someone else who likes strong tart notes in whiskies might adore this dram so if you run across an inexpensive way to try it out see if you have a different experience than I did. It’s also – as always – possible that I encountered a sub-standard batch.Note Some of this whisky’s characteristics remind me of a failed Bruichladdich store bottling that I tasted many years ago which was aged in a faulty Chenin Blanc cask which had colonized the whisky with the charming aroma of baby vomit. This whisky reminds me of that and it’s not a note that I encounter often.
475,Tyrconnell 10 year Madeira Finish Irish Whiskey - Tyrconnell is a line of Irish Single-Malt Whiskey from independent Irish distiller Cooley. Long hailed as the antidote to Irish Distillers Limited’s stranglehold on the Irish whiskey market Cooley distills and bottles excellent Irish whiskey (both blends and single-malts) and experiments with finishes and other innovations. Their Greenore single-grain whiskey for example continues to win awards. I got a taste of this 10-year old Tyrconnell finished in Madeira wine barrels. Thanks Louis!Nose Winey sour-salt aroma with hints of lemonade candied orange peel tropical fruits and refined honey. Fresh and bright.Palate Very honeyed with a medium slightly oily body. Resolves into cherry a stout oakiness and a lot of light jellied fruits.Finish Heavy with golden raisins and a little astringent from the oak tannins. Nice and long fading with just the sweet and light honey flavors. Very elegant.Overall The light flavors are very much in line with the 10 year age – bright and fruity. What’s surprising is how mellow and passive the alcohol burn is. Extremely easy-drinking. Nice dram.
476,Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye (13 year) - First I should start by apologizing. This blog post is entirely self-serving. It allows me to get a weekly post done even though I know few of you will ever have an opportunity to buy (or even try) any Van Winkle product due to its extreme scarcity and insane cult following. It also coincidentally allows me to brag that I secured myself a bottle. So take that! And… I’m sorry.Oh Pappy. What’s there to say about Pappy and company that hasn’t already been said a thousand times? The cult favorite of the American whiskey scene that got so popular that it’s now popular to NOT like it. Seriously I now frequently hear people dismissing Pappy bourbon to show that they’re past the hype. They’ve risen above it.Well I may have given up trying to track it down when it comes out twice a year but that doesn’t stop me from appreciating how damn good this stuff is. The rye (there’s only one bottling at 13 years of age) is apparently a Kentucky straight rye composed of a 50/50 combination of Medley rye from the long-closed Owensboro distillery and Cream of Kentucky rye whiskey from the Old Bernheim distillery in Louisville which closed in 1988. This vatting has been kept in stainless steel tanks since reaching 13 years (or possibly 18-19 years) to keep it from aging further and taking on more oak. Each biannual release is drawn from these dwindling reserves which means when it’s gone — it’s really gone. As with the Van Winkle bourbons Buffalo Trace is currently aging stocks of rye to replace Family Reserve 13 but it may be awhile. Note that the Medley distillery is slated for renovation and reopening so we may see Medley rye once again. Bernheim and its brands are owned by Heaven Hill and the old distillery remains silent.I have never seen the Van Winkle rye on shelves in California so I had to get an East Coast friend to track a bottle down for me last year. It’s marked as number B0604. I hoard its contents like liquid diamonds.Nose Concentrated wood extract fresh orange peel soaked in orange and cherry bitters. Ancient cracking shellac on cherrywood furniture. Any minty character or fresh spices contributed by the rye have been long dissolved by communication with white oak but they are replaced by deep complex wood extractives. Orange oil spice cake and something unnameable that makes you roll your eyes back in ecstasy. Honestly if I could bottle and wear this scent I would be happy to spend the rest of my days smelling like Van Winkle rye.Palate Orange oil again with dark brown sugar and a drying astringency similar to old red wine. Maple sugar candies melted vanilla bean ice cream and worn leather. The tongue burn is muted considering its proof inviting one to savor a mouthful for minutes at a time.Finish Medium-long. A hint of Douglas fir and a continuance of the orange/cherry/maple flavors from the nose. No bitterness but a lingering tannin causes the mouth to dry and pucker as the last sweetness fades.Overall To me this tastes like the Van Winkle bourbon but with the heavier (and sweeter) syrupy notes replaced with orange peel cherry bitters and a more apparent conversation with oak. Thankfully whether at 13 or 18 years of aging it stops short of being over-oaked. It is said that this particular rye has been resting unchanging in stainless steel tanks for decades in order to prevent it from aging further while limited amounts were siphoned off for yearly bottling. This is indeed at its apex of age and it will be a sad day when those tanks run dry and the last bottle of Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye sees the light of its final day.I’m rating this a sadistic “Must Have” because if you ever see a bottle at retail ($70) don’t hesitate. Buy it. Even if you don’t like rye you can always re-sell it at auction for a lot more. Still I wouldn’t pay $400 at auction for it. I wouldn’t pay $400 for any bottle of whisky even the best damn rye on the planet.
477,Very Old Barton 100 Proof - (This is a continuation of a series of reviews. For all of the background start with Very Old Barton 86 Proof.)This one is a little confusing – there are actually TWO Very Old Barton straight bourbons that are 100 proof. One says “Bottled-in-Bond” on it the other – this one – doesn’t. Internet scuttlebutt (there’s a word I don’t get to use often enough) claims that parent company Sazerac was forced to mix VOB from different distilling seasons when one of its warehouses collapsed in June (and then finished collapsing in July) of 2018. Mixing distilling seasons means no more Bottled-in-Bond designation so the bottle says “Crafted” instead. This after the company dropped the “6 year” age statement a few years ago. The rumor also suggests that Sazerac plans to bring back the BIB label when supplies return to previous levels but who knows.Since the claim to fame of VOB BIB as the “best value in bourbon” dates back to when the bottle was both Bottled-in-Bond and also 6 years of age I can’t say with any certainty that this new non-bonded NAS “100 proof” variant bears any resemblance to that lauded whiskey. This one at any rate is bottled at 50% ABV from batches of 4-6 year-old bourbon. The mash bill is 75% corn 15% rye and 10% malted barley and the whiskey is Kentucky Straight Bourbon.Nose Potent with a pronounced nose tickle. Sticky caramel apple light fruity notes of fruit punch green banana and tart cherry. Nice.Palate Thin body. A heavy tongue burn is followed by red apple skins tannic oak tart but dry oaky sugars toasty corn and cherry syrup (no longer tart). Dry but with good balance.Finish Medium length. Warming slightly sweet but muddled with unclear flavors from the palate. A little bitterness (bitter herbs) develops and the finish becomes more dry before fading.With Water Several drops of water amp up the nose tickle briefly before adding a tinge of sweetness in the form of plain simple syrup. The palate and finish seem unchanged aside from extra bitterness. Water optional.Overall A decent all-around bourbon. On the dry side but with good balance. The additional ABV over its siblings has brought additional robustness and concentrated flavor as well-needed extra sweetness. I’m still missing some of the volatile fruit notes from the 86 proof but the extra alcohol brings enough density to the glass that it’s worth the trade. It’s certainly a highly performant bourbon for a ridiculously low price even if it’s no longer the 6 year-old VOB BIB of halcyon days of yore. For what it’s worth between this the 86 proof and the 90 proof this one is my favorite.
478,Very Old Barton 86 Proof - In my long sordid and thus far unsuccessful quest to get my hands on a bottle of the much-lauded oft-discussed “VOB BIB” (That’s Very Old Barton Bottled-in-Bond) I present three VOBs that are not BIB. Rather than bore my adoring fans with three sequential weeks of reviews of what’s essentially the exact same bourbon at slightly different strengths I thought I’d dump them all at once. So please enjoy Very Old Barton 86 proof 90 proof and 100 proof. (There’s an 80 proof as well but I only have these three.)Before you ask “Why not just order a bottle of the BIB online?” I need to outline the parameters of my quest. VOB BIB has long been called the holy grail of cheap bourbon the most bang-for-your-buck in the category. Unfortunately it’s only available in a limited number of states mostly on the east coast. Ordering a bottle online would I figure defeat the entire purpose of cheap bourbon. I can’t enjoy a $15 bourbon if I paid $20 to have it shipped here and it would certainly negatively color my review. Every time I venture to the east coast (thus far Maryland Pennsylvania Washington D.C. and Louisiana) I seek out a bottle. I have thus far come up empty-handed. Barton bourbon is actually available on the west coast at a higher price under a different brand name and from a different formulation 1792 Ridgemont Reserve. It’s good but it’s not what I’m here for. Oddly the Sazerac website no longer contains any mention of Very Old Barton. Is that the whiskey industry equivalent to being Photoshopped out of the family reunion photo? Weird that.First in the series we have Very Old Barton 86 Proof. The whiskey is all from the Barton distillery in Bardstown Kentucky which is owned by Sazerac (Buffalo Trace) and was renamed to the Barton 1792 Distillery in 2009. Very Old Barton (which is not old and certainly not Very Old) used to have a “6 years old” age statement on the bottle which was changed to a lonely misleading “6” on the neck and then dropped altogether. The company claims VOB is still 6 years old “on average” whatever that means. For now assume it’s somewhat south of that number between 4 and 6 is likely. As for the mash bill if it has the same bill as the Bottled-in-Bond then it’s 75% corn 15% rye and 10% malted barley. The whiskey is bottled at 43% ABV (86 proof) and is Kentucky Straight Bourbon.Nose Delicately fruity with fruit punch orange juice cherry syrup and bubble gum. Sharp nose tickle despite the low ABV but no young or ‘off’ aromas.Palate Medium bodied. Very mild tongue burn. Tannic and slightly bitter (already) up front. Fruit punch and bubblegum again but also bitter aromatic compounds (Angostura bitters) and anise.Finish Medium-long. Less tannic than expected – only slightly mouth-drying. Drier now and quite bitter as those aromatic bitters flavors continue through the finish. No evolution.With Water A few drops of water amp up the bubblegum note and increase the nose tickle. The body seems thinner. This doesn’t benefit from the addition of water.Overall A very stable capable workhorse bourbon. There isn’t any of the dense robust oakiness that one usually associates with bourbon but it’s also not too dry or too cloyingly sweet. There’s more bitterness than I like in a bourbon but the fruit notes and the lack of off-flavors make this far better than a $12 whiskey has any right to be. Don’t get me wrong this is still bottom-shelf bourbon that couldn’t compete with the likes of Eagle Rare 10 or other $30+ bourbons but it is shockingly good for this price bracket.I like this just fine which is way more than I’ve ever said about a sub-$15 whiskey. This would work equally well as a house bourbon on a budget for both casual sipping or cocktails. Next up VOB 90 Proof.
479,Very Old Barton 90 Proof - (This is a continuation of a series of reviews. For all of the background start with Very Old Barton 86 Proof.)It seems pretty silly to follow a bourbon review with a second review of the exact same thing but 2% stronger. As far as I can tell online there’s no other difference. Same age “ish” (4-6 years) same mash bill (75% corn 15% rye and 10% malted barley) same distillery (Barton 1792 Distillery)… 2% stronger. Woo.via GIPHYI don’t know Ryan. I just don’t know. Oh it’s like a buck or two more too.Nose Slightly stronger nose tickle (than the 86) and not much fruit. There are caramel notes plus Bananas Foster.Palate Soft and supple medium bodied. A moderate tongue burn is followed by more bananas and caramel. There’s more sweetness on the palate and less bitterness.Finish Of medium length. Now the bitterness shows with anise and various bitter herbs. Not terribly tannic or mouth-drying. Fades without evolving.With Water A few drops of water seem to mute the aroma. Even a rest in the glass doesn’t resolve this instead adding more nose tickle. The palate seems thinner with no added flavors. Only the palate picks up a vague tart cherry note which does balance the bitterness a little. Don’t bother with the water here.Overall Super weird. At least with my bottles going from the 86 proof to the 90 proof means more nose tickle and tongue burn as expected but the loss of most of the fruit flavors and the gain of very little nondescript sweetness. My least favorite of the three reviewed today by a large margin. Guess that 2% did make a big difference after all just not in the direction I expected. If you’re in the store go for the 86 proof or the 100 proof over this one. If they have the Bottled-in-Bond label get that! Next up VOB 100 Proof (but not BIB!)
480,W. L. Weller (12 year) Bourbon - The more I taste bourbon the more I’m settling into preferred flavor camps. I hadn’t really noticed this with scotch (I’ll enjoy almost any scotch without too much young grain in it) but I’m really starting to prefer straight rye and wheated bourbon. Straight rye has a lot of interesting spice notes along with herbal spikes of menthol mint or eucalyptus. I drink rye when I want something to think about and analyze. Wheated bourbon on the other hand is full of cereals comfort-food sweetness (think Marshmallow Fluff) and comes across the palate as soft. I drink wheated bourbon when I want to sit back and relax… the spiritous equivalent to a mug of hot cocoa on a cold night. Even the high-proof stuff (like Pappy Van Winkle) is flavorsome in a deep fully-fledged way that is very satisfying… even as it burns the tastebuds off your tongue. All of this may be because I taste less of that “fake” corn-syrup flavor in wheated bourbons than I do in rye-flavored ones. I don’t have an explanation for that – they’re both still mostly corn.W. L. Weller is named after the eponymous William Larue Weller. Weller is thought to be the first distiller to use wheat as the flavoring grain for Kentucky Straight Bourbon and built a successful business on the idea. His distillery eventually merged with Pappy Van Winkle’s Stitzel distillery to form the Stitzel-Weller distillery that yielded all that craze-making Pappy juice. Of course both W. L. Weller 12 and (now) Pappy Van Winkle are made at Buffalo Trace’s distillery since Stitzel-Weller was closed in 1992.This is the 12 year-old expression and not to be confused with the annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection bottle (“William Larue Weller” with a vintage year usually 12 years old and at cask strength) which is as nearly impossible to find as Pappy. W. L. Weller 12 is sold alongside its (younger) non-age-statement siblings W. L. Weller Special Reserve and W. L. Weller Antique and is basically 12 year-old Pappy Van Winkle bourbon that didn’t make the barrel selection cut for Lot B. While “failed Pappy” doesn’t sound like a great selling point it should be pointed out that although the maturation differences resulting from barrel warehouse location and barrel individuality are well-documented (and the whole basis for the “single cask” phenomenon) the differences are often slight or incremental and are averaged together during vatting. In other words 12 year-old Pappy is statistically only slightly better than 12 year-old W.L. Weller. This suddenly starts to matter when you look at the price tag W. L. Weller 12-year is $26 a bottle. Failed Pappy 12 for $26? Sign me up!Note Someone might argue rightly that sometimes individual barrels are WAY better than the same barrel from another part of the warehouse. This can increase the average quality of the vatting they go into and further accounts for the popularity difference between Pappy and Weller as is the fact that the most popular Pappy (the 15 year) is cask strength and 3 years older.Nose Lovely round profile classic wheated bourbon notes of soft caramel and sugar-dusted breakfast cereals. This one has a sour twang like sour cherries and a distinctly corn-oriented acetone note. A little wood is detectable as a vein of ground cinnamon.Palate Very soft on the palate. Silky even. Moderate tongue burn. A little anise on the front some nice fresh corn notes in the middle and a continuous acetic acid throughout like cider vinegar or vermouth.Finish Medium length with vanilla and some light drying barrel tannins. Caramel reappears with honey-flavored candy (candy corn). No bitterness. Pleasant.With Water Several drops of water add maybe a hint of maple syrup to the nose. Alas the water seems to introduce a bitter note in the finish. I personally will skip the water.Overall There is a nice array of pleasant flavors and aromas although just because this is a wheated recipe does not mean it bears much resemblance to Pappy Van Winkle 15. There just isn’t that much depth in the W.L. Weller. Still for the money this is an easy-going sipper – an uncomplicated glass of bourbon both with and without an ice cube.
481,W. L. Weller Special Reserve Bourbon - The “Pappy Craze” has had an interesting side-effect. Since bottles of the venerable Pappy Van Winkle bourbons (and rye) are so impossibly hard to find in most areas the cachet afforded these bottles has bled over into other products bearing any kind of resemblance. Since Pappy Van Winkle bourbons were originally distilled at the now-defunct Stitzel-Weller distillery and because the Pappy bourbons are wheated (as opposed to rye-flavored) it stands to reason that frustrated Pappy-seekers would decide to buy the next-best (or maybe fifth-best) thing W.L. Weller wheated bourbons!To be fair these are wheat-recipe bourbons made by Buffalo Trace (where modern Pappy is also produced) and matured in the same warehouses. In my W. L. Weller 12-year review I refer to Weller bottlings as “failed Pappy” which may or may not be blogger poetic license. There is no longer an age statement (it used to say “7 years” on the bottle) but the Special Reserve clocks in at $15 retail which is hard to scoff at. Now sensing the Pappy Fever most retailers have jacked up the price on the Wellers so you’re likely to see them retailing for $40 or more! I was happy to pay $22 each for a few bottles when my local store got some in recently.Nose Soft cereal-forward bourbon. A ghost of cherry a twist of black pepper and a blanket of sweet corn kernels. A rest in the glass brings more cherry notes to the fore.Palate Full body not quite syrupy. Soft silky on the tongue. A mild tongue burn is followed by cherry cough syrup mild oaky sweetness and some mouth-drying tannins.Finish Medium long. Very consistent with the palate. A slight bitterness and fades with a ghost of fresh cherry.With Water A few drops of water seem to have no effect on the nose. Ditto the palate. No need for water but an ice cube isn’t going to kill it.Overall A solid wheated bourbon. This actually tastes the way I imagined that Maker’s Mark would taste until I got a mouthful of Maker’s Mark paint-thinner-in-oak. This doesn’t have quite the depth of flavor or developed oak flavors of the Weller 12-year but is very economical and doesn’t compromise much in quality. If this were available all of the time on shelves it would likely be my continuous “bottom shelfer”. Instead I have to ration the damn stuff.Recommended because it’s good solid wheated bourbon for $22. Don’t go out of your way to find it (or pay much more than $30) though this is not “Pappy in the rough”.
482,Wasmund’s Single Malt - Wasmund’s Single Malt American Whisky appeared on the scene in 2005 before either Craft whiskey or American Single Malt really had much meaning in the industry. Rick Wasmund inspired by his experience interning at the Bowmore distillery in Scotland decided to see how fruitwood smoke – as opposed to peat smoke – would affect malted barley. His experiments resulted in the founding of Copper Fox Distillery in Sperryville Virginia. Copper Fox not only has its own maltings – a rarity for any distillery in the world even Scotland – but also malts 100% of its own barley. The barley is a 6-row hybrid grown locally is smoked (“gently”) using fruitwood smoke (apple and cherry wood) and at least some of the whisky is aged with toasted applewood chips inserted into the barrels. They claim to be (and may very well be) the only distillery in the world that matures whisky over applewood. The distillery uses copper pot stills and distills in very small batches.The whisky is not chill-filtered and is bottled at a robust 48% ABV. The malt is young – 14 to 18 months in ex-bourbon according to the website although they claim that the insertion of wood chips speeds aging. I kind of doubt it’s very effective.Nose Scorched wood and charcoal up front followed immediately by pungent banana. (Oh God not the banana…) Yup now all I smell is banana. I have since learned that this aroma is “isoamyl acetate” which doesn’t make it any better. After a rest in the glass the banana has transformed into banana-flavored cardboard with a side of bland woodsmoke (like the effect of a far-distant forest fire) and a medicinal iodine note. Blech.Palate Thin bodied. An intense tongue burn kicks in right away followed by pear drops and other hard candies applewood smoke (yay!) and marshmallow.Finish Short. Pleasant with fruitwood smoke mild banana and light menthol. Fades quickly with candy notes (banana Runts I think).With Water A healthy splash of water does little for the aroma. On the palate it brings up a little more fruit and tames the tongue burn. Water isn’t really needed here.Overall I can’t recommend anything after writing the word “Blech” in the tasting notes. That said the whisky is what it says on the tin. There is definite fruitwood (apple primarily) smoke and it’s malty. That said the travesty of isoamyl acetate and cardboard on the aroma can’t be saved by fruit and smoke on the tongue. This bottle has a wide price range with outliers in the bottom of the range around $30. I think $30 is a fair price for this which means I might feel cheated paying $45. That said someone who is less sensitive to that awful banana note might really enjoy this.
483,Wemyss Malts: Peat Chimney - Formerly known as “vatted malts” “blended malts” are in vogue now largely due to the efforts of Compass Box’s John Glaser. He certainly didn’t invent the category(Johnnie Walker has had several blended malts in its portfolio – including Johnnie Walker Green and Gold – since the early 1990s and other bottlers had been doing it before then) he just made it cool. To be a blended malt a whisky must be comprised of single malts from more than one distillery and no other additive (such as grain whisky). Wemyss Malts pronounced “Weams” – yeah I thought it was “We Miss” too – has a line of romantically-named blended malts in ages 5 8 and 12 years old. Each includes a ‘key ingredient’ to define its character and justify its name as well as up to 16 other malts. I tried The Spice King (spices courtesy of a heavy dose of Talisker) The Smooth Gentleman (key ingredient Aultmore) and The Peat Chimney (with Caol Ila) at a K&L Wednesday spirits tasting in Redwood City CA.The cool thing about these products (at least the 8 year-old variety) is that they’re all uniformly priced at $40. This kind of deal isn’t particularly common in today’s malt marketplace and a carefully blended all-malt offering at minimum 8 years… that has a nice ring to it. If you like heavy peat though I suggest looking at Laphroaig 10 or Finlaggan for your value as The Peat Chimney is light on Islay style. Below I give you my notes on The Peat Chimney which is a blend of 16 malts. The largest proportion is from Islay distillery Caol Ila which is known for its lighter style and mild peat.Nose Light chimney soot style peat smoked fish pine sap. Nice. Not as potent as the heavy-hitter Islays but a nice balance of mild malt and non-aggressive smokiness.Palate Tad sour. Some (very nice) green grass green apple prominent chocolate caramel and a little barrel char. Pleasant and inoffensive.Finish Drying. Nice. Not too peat-heavy. Balance of mild malt sweetness and those sour fruits/grass.Overall This is a good whisky to introduce a neophyte to peated Scotch. It has all of the hallmarks of Islay smoke char vegetative elements and some meatiness but all wrapped up in a mild non-threatening package. However if you’re already a fan of peated whisky this will seem far too tame.Note Yes I recycled the blurb at the top from the Spice King and Smooth Gentleman reviews. Alas there isn’t much to say about these except that they’re very good values and quite drinkable.
484,Wemyss Malts: Smooth Gentleman - Formerly known as “vatted malts” “blended malts” are in vogue now largely due to the efforts of Compass Box’s John Glaser. He certainly didn’t invent the category(Johnnie Walker has had several blended malts in its portfolio – including Johnnie Walker Green Label – since the early 1990s and other bottlers had been doing it before then) he just made it cool.

If you like heavy peat though I suggest looking at Laphroaig 10 or Finlaggan for your value as The Peat Chimney (review upcoming) is light on Islay style. Below I give you my notes on Smooth Gentleman which is a blend of 16 malts the largest proportion is from Speysider distillery Aultmore. Aultmore’s production primarily goes into the Dewars blends but alone it is light sweet fruity and floral.Nose Light Banana marshmallow cream. Mildly malty with elements of sugar cookie dough and vanilla ice cream.Palate Nice mild oak. Smooth on the tongue as promised. A wave of unexpected tropical fruits Kiwi? Blueberry?Finish Unfortunately short with simple echoes of malt and brown sugar but not much else.Overall Like a lowlander with an extra bit of sweet malt/brown sugar. Not much to recommend although super easy to drink and smooth as advertised.Note Yes I recycled the blurb at the top from the Spice King review. Alas there isn’t much to say about these except that they’re very good values and quite drinkable. Similar review of The Peat Chimney coming up soon.
485,Wemyss Malts: The Spice King - Formerly known as “vatted malts” “blended malts” are in vogue now largely due to the efforts of Compass Box’s John Glaser.

If you like heavy peat though I suggest looking at Laphroaig 10 or Finlaggan for your value as The Peat Chimney (review upcoming) is light on Islay style. Below I give you my notes on The Spice King 8 year old my favorite of the three.Nose Talisker salt/brine but in a minor way. Hint of banana? Not a big Talisker nose but some seaweed & seaspray. Shy – could use awhile in the glass to open up.Palate Good medium body. Brown sugar up front then some VERY nice cinnamon nutmeg and salted caramels. Yum.Finish Medium-long. Some peat more sea-salt. Fading black pepper. There’s the Talisker.Overall Very nice. I would buy this at $40 despite the shy nose. I just wish they bottled at 43% or 46% ABV as I’m missing the customary Talisker kick.
486,West Cork Original Classic Blend - Here’s another review in my series on value blends some of which can be outstanding and some not so much. The West Cork Distillery is a new (opened in 2003 as an experimental “pet project” and then expanded to its current location in 2013) and actually independent Irish distiller unlike the previous poster-child for Irish (whiskey) independence Cooley which sold to Beam Suntory in 2011. Among other things West Cork bottles this blend and a 10 year-old Irish Single Malt.The Original Classic Blend is your pretty standard Irish blended whiskey a blend of single-malt and grain whiskey aged for an unpublished (read very short) amount of time in ex-bourbon barrels and bottled at the baseline of 40% ABV. While it’s quite easy on the wallet at around $27 a bottle I should point out that you can get other better blends for less.Nose Very light but with a piercing acetone note. Hay lemon vodka and not much else.Palate Thick syrupy body. Quite hot at first which recedes to reveal cashew butter chewy nougat and salt-water taffy (vanilla).Finish Medium-short. Malty with a hint of milk chocolate and a reprise of the acetone/vodka from the nose alas.With Water A few drops of water make this smell if possible more like whisky-tinged vodka. The water also thins the palate adding nothing. Skip the water here.Overall Huh. On one hand it’s light traditionally-styled Irish blended whiskey with a heavy basket full of nutty flavors to surprise the tongue. On the other hand it has one of the least successful aromas of any whisky I’ve come across a short finish and is very hot on the tongue (some would call this “not smooth”). I can’t recommend it for anything although when mixed into one of the few cocktails requiring Irish whiskey you’ll likely not be able to tell the difference. How’s that for a ringing endorsement?
487,Westland American Oak - Anyone who reads a few of my reviews of American “craft” whisky will be familiar with my distaste for paying $50 to $70 for 3 year-old whisky that only roughly competes with more established bourbons and Scottish single malts. Yes American Single Malt as a category is enjoying a burgeoning awakening but that doesn’t mean I want to pay double for something that’s not quite as good as what they’ve been doing in Scotland for centuries just because it’s “local” and “grain to glass” and “craft”.And then there’s Seattle’s own Westland arguably one of the first “craft” American whiskies to attract international attention. Let me cut to the chase If you haven’t tasted Westland yet you are missing out and you can’t properly assess the landscape of American Single Malt. Get a glass somewhere spring for a bottle or buy one of those three-in-one tasting sets of cute little 200ml bottles like I did. As far as my experience with the distillery has been so far everything they make is excellent.Westland does a few things differently and the results are right in the glass. First it’s not just “malted barley” like 99% of single-malt scotch. Westland uses a blend of 5 different barley malts Washington Select Pale Malt Munich Malt Extra Special Malt Pale Chocolate Malt and Brown Malt. I can’t pretend to know the differences between all of those but I do know that they refer to different brands of malted barley that are each at a different brewers’ roast level or using a different malting/roasting process. Westland isn’t the only American distillery taking cues from beer brewing but they’re doing it best. The distillery then uses Belgian Saison brewer’s yeast with a very long slow fermentation. Note that Westland’s website is a trove of whisky-geek information. I’ll try to summarizeThe distillery uses process water from the Cedar River and runs a pair of Vendome copper pot stills heated with steam coils. They fill new make into a combination of new air-dried (not kilned) American Oak barrels at either #1 (heavy toast) or #3 char. They also use some first-fill ex-bourbon casks. The whiskies are currently aged a minimum of 3 years – although it’s worth noting that all of that new American oak doesn’t take long to mature malt whiskey so it can’t be compared directly to the maturation length of single malts from Scotland. The whiskies are blended in batches using those various casks and filled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring.Nose Oak-forward with slightly tannic sap notes that are almost like pine resin. Dry – with very reticent sugars. A pleasant yeasty top note suggests sour ale or cider vinegar. After a rest in the glass it opens up with a little cherry and a dollop of pancake syrup.Palate Silky body. Again oak-forward with lots of mouth-drying oaky tannins. After a minimal tongue burn there is a dominant cereal note that very strongly suggests chocolate stout. The toasty barley is very slightly bitter (like bittersweet chocolate) and not quite acrid or burned (a blessing). Finish Medium-long. That chocolate note – now joined by roasted coffee bean – continues robustly into and throughout the finish. A little nuttiness – nougat or pecan – appears and fades slowly. Ends without any trailing bitterness.With Water The addition of several drops of water amps up the nose tickle without adding any new notes. The palate seems softer but the chocolate notes are diluted. The finish is a bit more vibrant. I suggest trying it without the water and then add a little to see if it does anything for you.Overall The aroma begins a little shy and unpromising but on the palate this whisky shines with chocolate and malt and oak in a potent balance. The experience if very like sipping a dark roast iced coffee with unsweetened cocoa powder in it. The finish is rock-solid and complete with all of the palate notes and ends gracefully without any extra bitterness – a success.If the nose were a little more in line with the rest this would be a Must Have. As is it’s just a Must Try (with a very strong recommendation that you make the effort) especially if you don’t currently have a high opinion of American Single Malt as a category. Westland is an education. And yes it is indeed worth the $60-$70 although I really think the tasting set of 200ml bottles if you see it is a good way to pick your favorite from the core range. I do feel that it’s important to taste this “basic” version before the peated or sherry wood expressions to get a complete picture.
488,Westland Peated - After my previous gushing review of Westland’s core American Oak expression I tasted the other two members of the core range. This one uses the same 5-malt mash bill of malted barley (barlies? barleys?) but includes a percentage of whiskey made from peated malt. Make sure to read that American Oak review first since I go over Westland’s unique approach to whiskymaking.Westland’s website although replete with geeky whiskymaking details is mum on the topic of peat. We know from other sources that Westland is experimenting with local Pacific Northwest (USA) peat but that the core range Peated expression uses already-peated malt imported from the Eastern Highlands of Scotland. That peated malt is distilled (together or separately I can’t tell) along with Westland’s standard “5-malt” blend of Washington Select Pale Malt Munich Malt Extra Special Malt Pale Chocolate Malt and Brown Malt which are all essentially the result of different toast levels or malting methods. This means that unlike many peated single malt scotches such as Laphroaig or Lagavulin the malt in each bottle is not all peated. In fact it’s less than half. Westland does this to maintain a sense of region and the house characteristics – they are looking to balance “Westland” with “Scottish peat” without letting one overpower the other.It’s worth noting that as the peat is Highland peat it will tend more towards campfire and heather (gorse) rather than seaweed (iodine) and brine. A wise choice I think.Westland Peated uses both new American oak casks as well as first-fill ex-bourbon casks. Like the American Oak the Peated release is aged a minimum of 3 years and bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring. In some places this one is $5-$10 more expensive than the other core bottlings.Nose Smoldering campfire with just a little suggestion of pine (resiny) smoke. The smoke though is so mild that it acts more like a seasoning. The primary character is sweet malty grains butterscotch ripe pear and salted caramel. The smoke is so well-integrated that it simply adds a peppery toasty quality to all of the above notes… think grilled pear instead of ripe pear or caramel with smoked salt. Delectable.Palate Medium bodied. Ashy peat greets the tongue then after a mild tongue burn the peat begins to recede to reveal dark chocolate truffles pear pastilles and dark roast coffee beans.Finish Long. The chocolate is dominant now instead of the smoke. Cocoa powder coffee grounds and only a little bit of oaky tannins. As it fades the peat turns minty – a touch of menthol.With Water A few drops of water increase the nose tickle and also add more sweetness (caramel). The water also tames the tongue burn and might decrease the effects of the peat. Water optional but I don’t think it hurts here.Overall Of the three flagship Westland single-malts I actually like this one the most. The peat is so perfectly intertwined with the Westland house characteristics that it bolsters all of them without taking over. Someone unfamiliar with peat might not even realize the flavor is “peat” or “smoke” and instead just detect the complexity it adds. This is in direct contrast with most peated Scottish malts which hit you over the head with peat. The change is welcome at least in this context. I still think the Westland American Oak is required reading before this one but I’d rather buy a second bottle of this.
489,Westland Sherry Wood - After my previous gushing review of Westland’s core American Oak expression I tasted the other two members of the core range. This one uses the same 5-malt mash bill of malted barley (barlies? barleys?) but includes a percentage of whiskey aged in sherry casks. Make sure to read that American Oak review first since I go over Westland’s unique approach to whiskymaking.Westland’s website has a meandering article about the sherry wine industry its future and Westland’s approach to it. This is worth reading if you’ve any interest in the use of sherry casks in whisky production but to turn a mountain back into a molehill suffice it to say that Westland only uses sherry casks that were used (mostly by small Spanish producers) to mature actual D.O.C. sherry. They have rejected the industry-wide (indeed nearly the modern standard) practice of “seasoning” casks with throwaway low-grade sherry or related wines. They admit that this decision is not sustainable so it will be interesting to see where Westland takes this disciplined approach as the market for “real” sherry casks continues to implode.Westland’s meticulously-sourced sherry casks are shipped whole (rather than broken down into staves and re-coopered which is how most whisky producers handle them) to the States and then filled with the same five-malt new make as the American Oak release. The distillery uses both ex-Oloroso and ex-PX sherry casks and blends the resulting full-term sherry-matured malt whiskey with the Westland whiskey aged in new American oak. This is similar to the now-widespread trend in Scotland of “double cask” products. Like the American Oak the Sherry Wood release is aged a minimum of 3 years and bottled at 46% ABV without chill-filtration or added coloring.Nose Straightforward sherry notes – fig plum/prune date and balsamic vinegar (including a slight tart note) – but on the dry side. Underneath mild oak with a bit of nuttiness. A rest in the glass adds some dried cranberries and the whole thing becomes a tad sweeter (added caramel).Palate Heavy body almost viscous. Chocolate-covered cherries (dark ones) up front with a moderate tongue burn. Roasted coffee beans cocoa nibs and a reprise of the dark dried fruit notes from the aroma. Underneath the mild oak continues to support.Finish Medium-short. Drying – with a lot of dusty cocoa and fruit leather. The fruit and chocolate notes fade quicker than I expected leaving just oak sawdust and mouth-drying (but not bitter!) tannins.With Water A few drops of water amp up that tart note (increasing the impression of balsamic vinegar) but cover up some of the dried fruit. The palate also seems more tart with less chocolate. I suggest skipping the water – 46% ABV is just right.Overall Westland’s malt is so good that the coating of sherry almost seems like unnecessary window dressing. The classic Westland coffee-and-chocolate notes are present in abundance and although the sherry notes pair well with them (chocolate-covered cherries yes please) they feel like a layer on top rather than integrated into the whole. This is nit-picking; It’s tasty stuff but don’t pass over the Westland American Oak just because this one has sherry notes too. (Note there’s also a peated version…)
490,Westward American Single Malt - If I had to pick a category of whisk(e)y that is growing and improving the fastest I would probably pick the burgeoning category of American Single Malt Whiskey. These whiskies are differentiated from the venerable bourbon and rye industries not only because they all come from small “craft” producers but also because they use only one grain in the mashbill malted barley. In turn these whiskies are differentiated from European single malt whiskies such as single malt scotch and single malt Irish whiskey by the prevalent use of full-term maturation in virgin charred American oak (as opposed to re-used cooperage). Note that some American Single Malts like the pioneering Oregon distiller McCarthy’s take the European approach and mature in used barrels. Still malt whiskey distilled and matured entirely in virgin (new) charred American oak creates a unique and novel flavor profile. And they’re only getting better.Not to be confused with Seattle producer Westland (which also makes amazing American single malt whiskey in the US Pacific Northwest) Westward is a Portland Oregon based distillery founded in 2004 by Christian Krogstad who has a brewing and winemaking background. Westward uses two custom-designed copper pot stills to distill an ale-style wash (utilizing ale yeasts instead of more traditional distiller’s yeast strains) from locally-sourced and locally-malted Pacific Northwest two-row barley. The resulting spirit is aged in lightly charred (as opposed to bourbon’s heavy char) new American oak barrels. The result is bottled at 45% ABV and retails for an elevated $65+ per bottle. These are the prices we pay for craft.Westward’s single malt is bottled in small batches without chill filtration. The age is not disclosed but it’s likely somewhere between 2 and 5 years which is pretty standard for American products aging in new oak. Westward also produces special releases that are finished in wine or beer casks.Honestly the only complaint I have so far is that Westward’s website is a vapid brochure that contains the absolute bare minimum of information. Read the room Westward modern whisky consumers want information.Nose What. Dripping with dense nougaty syrupy notes. Hazelnut butter. Dark roast coffee. Amber tree sap (not quite maple syrup). Bubbling baked bananas. Coconut cream. Every one of these aromas is DENSE in a way that is a little hard to put into words.Palate Silky body. A moderate tongue burn is followed by wave after wave of those same notes from the aroma. Very consistent. Baked bananas with heavy caramelized syrups. Roasted nuts. A latte.Finish Medium length. A little bitterness balances out all the heavy dark sugars like black coffee with cream. Evolves into various kinds of nuts (hazelnut brazil nut cashew) before fading. Fades sooner than you’d think but keeps up the theme and the complexity throughout.With Water Several drops of water bring out a little wood smoke on the nose and (sigh) more banana. The palate seems unaltered. The finish might have an extra vegetal note like anise seed or cardamom. Water optional here.Overall My first thought is that this is a lot like Cut Spike with the major difference that this has a lot more complexity in the flavors. Instead of straight dense heavy oaky sweetness like Cut Spike this has convolutions of roasty by-products like coffee and toasted nuts. Think of the difference between cream soda (Cut Spike) and cola or root beer. Excellent and challenging.I would like it better if there weren’t so much banana which just kind of triggers me. That’s a personal issue though. This is really quite extraordinary whiskey.
491,Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon - Wild Turkey a brand owned by the Campari group and labeled “Austin Nichols Distilling Company” has been on the shelves under its current name since 1940 although the distillery had been producing bourbon since 1869. Its flagship product is bottled at 101 proof (50.5% ABV) after a distillation that the company refers to as “low and slow” yielding a relatively low barrel-strength of 109 proof (around 54.5% ABV).Nose The nose tickle is strong but there is a bright acidity to the aroma. Lemons vanilla ice cream some raw grain spirit. A dash of water brings out some green grass and a hint of honeysuckle.Palate Powerful and fiery they aren’t kidding about the 101 proof (even if it is a gimmick). The flame resolves into a nice bright bouquet of sour lemons unripe pears cinnamon vanilla creme brulee molasses and a strong suggestion of campfire ashes (barrel char). Fiery but not as youthful or industrial-tasting as some other young bourbons I’ve tried. A dash of water doesn’t tame the burn much but does yield a delicate nutty sweetness – roasted chestnuts.Finish Short but warming. Mostly wet charcoal over-browned baked goods (cookies?) and a bit of nuttiness – maybe walnut.I am a lot more impressed by this bourbon than I was with any of the earlier cheap American whiskeys I’ve tried. The rawness of the grain is apparent in the nose but subtly hidden on the palate by the surprising variety of fruit and sweet baked flavors. Still not as easy to drink and enjoy as a single malt but definitely worth drinking neat especially at this price. It’s even nicer with a dash of water. This may be the first sub-$25 bottle of bourbon that I can heartily recommend!
492,Wild Turkey 101 Rye - Wild Turkey has been making rye since before the “rye renaissance” began – starting some time in the 1980s using a “barely legal” mashbill of 51% rye 37% corn and 12% malted barley. Around 2012 when bartending morphed into “mixology” and birthed a renewed customer fervor for rye whiskey Wild Turkey’s workhorse 101-proof rye disappeared from shelves and forced the company to create and promote an 81-proof budget variant to stretch stocks. Only last year (2017) did Wild Turkey 101 Kentucky Straight Rye reappear and only in the restaurant- and bar-oriented 1-liter format. It also sported a new label and a higher price tag at around $40 a liter.Wild Turkey is known for using a lower barrel-entry proof than competitors with the goal of pulling the spirit off of the stills with more flavor compounds intact. The barrels are number 4 char (also called “alligator” for their scaly appearance) and bottles are filled at (duh) 101 proof aka 50.5% ABV. Note that aside from the 81-proof rye the company also sells a rye in the pricier Russells Reserve line.Nose Sweet with distinct notes of cherry liqueur blonde fudge and a background of pine sap. Some oaky vanilla in there too but not much in the way of traditional rye “spices”. Maybe some cinnamon.Palate Medium body. Dry woodiness greets the tongue followed by a robust tongue burn appropriate for 101 proof. Barrel tannins cherry juice and sweet corny bourbon notes march in line. More astringent than expected from the aroma and still only limited spices (clove this time).Finish On the short side. A touch of bubble gum a ghost of pine resin and not much else. Forgettable.With Water A few drops of water brighten the palate adding some marshmallow and orange peel. It also seems to improve the finish by allowing some of those fruits to linger adding balance. Water is a good idea here.Overall This tastes like a reasonable budget rye. I think it’s a bit dumbed-down trading in rye spice for corn sweetness and it has a disappointing finish without timely addition of water. Unfortunately it is allocated in some markets and surprisingly pricey when you can find it. The 81-proof is available for $25 a bottle which is also high for what it is. If your purpose is to find a rye for cocktails or ice and don’t want to shell out an extra few bucks for the superior-in-every-way Hochstadter’s Vatted then this isn’t a bad choice especially considering you know where it was distilled unlike most of the cheap NAS rye on the market right now. If you really want bang for your buck though look no further than Rittenhouse Rye 100… at least until Wild Turkey increases production and decreases the price to something reasonable like $25 (the 81 ought to be $20).Despite the price I’ll give this a Recommended rating… but it’s by the skin of its hen’s teeth. Get it? Hen? Turkey?… ok yeah that was bad. I apologize.
493,Wild Turkey Forgiven (Batch 303) - Whiskey at the scale that it’s produced for international consumption is expensive. You don’t write off an entire barrel or vat of whiskey just because someone made a mistake or some act of God collapsed a warehouse on it. You bottle it come up with some marketing spin and a catchy name and try to make a profit on it. That’s what Glenfiddich did when one of their warehouses collapsed in 2010 producing the very tasty Snow Phoenix.According to the marketing spin on Forgiven a warehouse worker accidentally blended some Wild Turkey straight rye into some Wild Turkey straight bourbon which immediately created a blended American whiskey that can’t be called “straight” anymore. Presumably the accident tasted pretty good (and it’s not like this is a new idea after all) so Wild Turkey bottled it as a limited edition small batch blend at 45.5% ABV. The blend is 78% 6 year-old Wild Turkey Bourbon and 22% 4 year-old Wild Turkey Rye. It must have been pretty successful because they went back and made the same “mistake” for a second batch. (The first batch was “302” and this review is for “303”.)Batch 303 appears to be running dry on shelves so if you’re interested you might need to pay a little extra or drive a little further to find it. No word yet on whether the “mistake” will be repeated for a batch 304…Nose Dry spicy with faint peach marzipan and sweet tea. A rest in the glass adds sweetness and reveals some of the rye spices (clove cinnamon etc.).Palate Syrupy body. The same notes from the aroma show on the entry but a wave of tongue burn washes everything away. Hot for 45%. After the burn subsides the aroma notes return plus cinnamon red hots and sugar cookie dough.Finish Medium-long. Somewhat dry but very consistent with the flavors on the tongue. Fades with a bit of hazelnut butter and some slightly-bitter charcoal.With Water A small splash of water appears to have little effect except for taming the tongue burn a bit while also thinning the body.Overall While somewhat dry (like most Wild Turkey) this is a nice balance of the advertised components rye-like spices with bourbon-like sweetness and a little sweet tea and peach thrown in for pizzazz. I’m not sure it’s really worth almost $50 considering the other very value-conscious Wild Turkey offerings especially with no age statement and a midline proof. If you like Wild Turkey and are looking for a slight upgrade you won’t be upset with this. You could alternatively save some money and do your own “blend” with some $20 Wild Turkey 101 bourbon and some $30 Wild Turkey 101 rye. The ages won’t be the same but I bet it would be pretty close in flavor.
494,Wild Turkey Longbranch - I’ve always been a fan of Wild Turkey especially the baseline 101 expression because it has always represented classic bourbon value to me. You pay less than $20 you get a bottle of classically-styled bourbon without any off-notes. Reliable. Simple. Inexpensive.Lately though Wild Turkey has been trying to buck that reputation and compete with the (other) big names in bourbon by releasing special edition this and distiller’s own that which initially struck me as a bit of a betrayal of the brand. Still if you can’t beat ’em…Today we have another special edition this time with a celebrity endorsement. Ugh. Say it ain’t so Turkey. Yes indeed Wild Turkey Longbranch is the brainchild of actor Matthew McConaughey. Luckily I discovered this fact after buying a bottle or I might have been dissuaded from purchase by the sellout-ish-ness of it all. Don’t get me wrong I enjoy me some McConaughey. But I’m also a big Ryan Reynolds fan and you don’t see me espousing the glories of Aviation gin. So we are putting aside The Lincoln Lawyer and whether or not he actually worked hand-in-hand with Jimmy and Eddie Russell to select casks. We also won’t wonder whether the concept of mellowing Wild Turkey bourbon through Texas Mesquite charcoal was his idea or not. We’ll firmly ignore the fact that McConaughey is actually on payroll at Wild Turkey as Creative Director. At the end of the day this is some damn fine bourbon for what is these days a reasonable price.For less than 40 bones you get 8 year-old Wild Turkey Kentucky Straight Bourbon which has been mellowed using a similar process to Jack Daniel’s and other Tennessee Whiskies. Instead of filtering it through 10 feet or whatever of sugar maple charcoal Longbranch is circulated first through American white oak charcoal (the same oak used for barrels) and then through mesquite charcoal from McConaughey’s native state of Texas. Barbecue fans will be familiar with the flavor of mesquite smoked meats which is definitely a departure from oak.The resulting bourbon is bottled at a reasonable 43% ABV and does not provide an age statement which means future batches could dip below that 8 year-old mark. McConaughey and the Russells say they were going for a sweeter mellower easier-drinking style of sipping whiskey but with a hint of Texas smoke. Let’s see how it turned out.Nose Deeply oaky and with more smoke than commonly found in bourbon. It has aromas of charred corn drippy oak resin horehound candy and Moxie. There’s also something vegetal perhaps tobacco leaf. Potent.Palate Medium body. Dry despite the sweet aroma notes. Tons of oak heavy root notes (root beer sassafras etc.) and balanced charcoal. I might taste mesquite or it could be marketing. Either way this is a tasty slightly-sweet bourbon with just barely enough tongue burn to feel legitimate.Finish Long. Most of the palate notes continue through the finish including the mesquite/marketing. Fades slowly without getting bitter. Very nice.With Water Several drops of water initially amps up the nose tickle so give it a rest in the glass. Even after the rest it remains overly astringent. This bourbon does not benefit from added water.Overall This is a very capable bourbon. It ticks all of the boxes while also having a little “extra” in the form of mesquite charcoal and derived mild smoke flavors. I would have preferred an age statement and a bump in ABV to 48% or 50% but even at the suggested retail of $40 this is right on the money – literally! Hah! So I can’t really complain. It can easily be found for cheaper even under $30 which is quite a good deal.Honestly it’s been a little while since I’ve had a new bourbon and thought “Yes I’d buy that again” so I’m going to call this a “Must Try” especially if you already appreciate The Turkey. Or Matthew McConaughey. Whatever.
495,Willett Family Reserve Estate Bottled Rye (2 year) - Kentucky Bourbon Distillers is a big name behind the scenes in the recent renaissance of American bourbon and rye. KBD once the Willett Distillery Company hasn’t actually distilled anything since the 1980s. Until now that is. KBD bottles several brands using whiskey distilled at (probably) Heaven Hill Distillery and LDI including Noah’s Mill Rowan’s Creek Old Bardstown Johnny Drum and their premium and single-barrel label Willett. Now after more than 30 years of bottling other peoples’ juice Willett under the ownership of the Kulsveen family has bottled the first whiskey – a 2 year-old cask-strength rye – distilled at its refurbished distillery in Bardstown Kentucky.This particular rye underwent its first distillation on a column still and a second distillation on a copper pot still from a combination of two mashbills (74% rye 11% corn 15% malted barley and 51% rye 35% corn 15% malted barley with more of the first mashbill used). The distillate went into American white oak charred barrels for two years at the Willett property and was bottled without chill-filtration.Did I mention this is 2 years old? In this era of mediocre NAS bottles championed by the cause of the “age doesn’t matter” marketers it’s refreshing to see a young whiskey advertised with its stated age and despite its youth. If more people taste young whiskey this good then more people will be willing to accept young whisky on the shelf. Then we can finally stop pretending that NAS is the solution to marketing ‘young’ whiskey. Less deception in bottle labeling makes me a happy customer. I say don’t pretend that age doesn’t matter by removing the age statement on the bottle but instead show people that even minimum-aged spirits can be phenomenal when carefully crafted. Nothing will kill the Older is Better myth faster than amazing rye with a big bold “2 years” on the label. Good on ‘ya Willett.Now I have a particular fondness for young rye that actually tastes like rye. I want big eucalyptus wintergreen or pine and I want spicy ‘sharp’ notes of cinnamon cardamom and anise. Occasionally some caraway (think rye bread) is nice too. Let’s see how Willett’s new rye shapes up…Nose Pine! Showers of sappy pine needles. The nose tickle is prominent but not excessive. Deeper in I can get a full round sweetness a smattering of star anise and cardamom and a palpable sense that this is carefully made genuine rye whiskey.Palate Thin body. At full cask strength the burn is (as expected) eye-watering. Then there are waves of minty wintergreen Tic-Tacs sweet cereal grains and malted milk balls (minus the chocolate).Finish Medium-long. A baseline of caramel malt syrup underlies more pine and wintergreen. As the sweetness fades a little caraway and the remnants of anise linger with a slight astringent tannin. No bitterness to speak of.With Water A much-needed splash of water reveals a dusty spice-bin redolent with clove and nutmeg. On the palate the burn is much reduced – a relief – and one is able to focus on the sweet grains and sharp spices of true rye whiskey. The finish is also somewhat spicier – with powdered cinnamon finally making an appearance.Overall A case-study in rye whiskey. Rye is (in my opinion) best serviced by brief aging (two year is perfect) and at cask strength. This is the holy convergence of eclectic robust sippable whiskey and perfection for period cocktail mixing. When you use a “real” rye whiskey like this the rye elements shine through the cocktail marrying perfectly with bitters and the high proof gives the drink body and substance. This type of rye makes for a snappy poignant cocktail instead of a muddy sweet one. I’m very happy that Willett is finally able to distill their own juice and doubly happy that the juice is SO GOOD.
496,Winchester Straight Bourbon - If you want to start a slap-fight amongst self-styled whisky aficionados all you have to do is bring up the recent phenomenon of “rapid aged” whiskies otherwise known as “technology aged” whiskies. The usual stance of haughty affront is somewhat understandable when you consider that much of whisky’s appeal comes from its romantic associations with the little-understood magic of oak barrel aging. Most people agree that oak has pronounced positive effects on grain-based spirits and that those effects tend to become more positive the more years are spent in the barrel. Just look at the NAS debate to discover how much barrel-aging means to the majority of whisky appreciators.So imagine the reaction that such a person would have to the idea that you could replicate some of that aging effect via the use of various rapid technological processes including the use of intense light pressure or ultrasonic vibration and that the effect of oak aging could be induced over the course of hours days or weeks rather than years or decades. “Balderdash!” they might say (or maybe something more colorful).Personally I have now tasted two of these “technology-aged” products and have attempted to maintain an open mind on the subject. Just like my stance on NAS my stance on “technology aging” is that the proof is in the pudding. If it tastes better and is priced lower than equivalent traditionally-aged whiskies I am willing to participate. For examples see my reviews of Lost Spirits Ouroboros and the Abominations. There my conclusion is that Lost Spirits’ proprietary technology aging process produces eclectic and enjoyable whiskies (also rums) that basically create their own market niche. They neither replace traditionally-aged whiskies nor even compete directly against them. They might as well have a shelf to themselves in the liquor store and I will continue to buy them.Enter competitor TerrePURE Spirits based in Charleston South Carolina. A little Googling can tell you what you need to know about the technology so I’ll just summarize it by saying that they use ultrasonic vibrations to induce chemical reactions in a young spirit (in this case 2 year-old sourced bourbon) likely with inserted oak staves. This has a variety of effects including filtering out congeners which cause off-flavors building mouth-feel by esterification of fatty acids and improving color absorption from the wood without added colorants. Due to alcohol labeling laws Winchester Straight Bourbon must be first aged in new charred American oak barrels (the “old” way) for at least two years before it can undergo this “ultrasonic filtration”. The Winchester brand also sells an “Extra Smooth Bourbon” and a “Rye Whiskey” which do not have this 2 year requirement. The Winchester brand is made by TerrePURE as a private label for sale at Total Wine & More stores. The bourbon is bottled at 45% ABV and sold for around $25 per 750ml bottle.Nose Sweet floral tutti-frutti. Deeper in the glass is bubblegum and kiwi green apple green pear and a fake almost-cloying corn-syrup note like cheap drugstore candy. Smells EXACTLY like McAfee’s Benchmark Old No. 8.Palate Thin. Sweet up-front like liquid tart candy. Apple skins fresh corn bottled light corn syrup. Very little tongue burn but there is a background acrid plastic note and a grainy corn-whiskey note.Finish Short. Simple fruity. Fades with a bit of barrel-char bitterness which is the first note of oak I’ve tasted yet. That acrid plastic note returns now tinged with menthol… like mouthwash. Ends with a flourish of honey.With Water A few drops of water dull some of the fruit and release a wave of vanilla extract. The finish is a little more tart. Water optional.Overall At first it reminded me of McAfee’s Benchmark in that it smells highly floral and fruity for a bourbon and comes across the palate thin and insubstantial like an unaged corn whiskey. The whole is oddly candied and has fruit notes like you’d imagine finding in beakers at a candy factory lab but with a lurking background of cheap-tasting acrid grain. This my first impression of the TerrePURE technology is that in the process of stripping unwanted by-products of bourbon distillation they’ve also stripped much of what makes a whiskey taste like bourbon. This leaves you with a kind of bourbon-flavored corn brandy. Weird and not very pleasant if you’re expecting bourbon. If you’re used to flavored vodka this might not taste awful but you’d be far better off buying something like Four Roses Yellow Label which is a far superior introduction to real bourbon and cheaper to boot.In this case at least the naysayers have it right. TerrePURE technology aging has turned bad sourced 2 year-old straight bourbon into bad technology-aged straight bourbon. No thanks.
497,Wolfburn Aurora - Wolfburn Distillery in Thurlo is the true definition of a reopened distillery First established in 1821 it became the largest distillery in Caithness in northern Scotland and then fell into ruin sometime in the 1860s. The original distillery is now no more than a vague pile of stones. The modern Wolfburn distillery was rebuilt near the site of the original distillery and ran its first spirit run in January of 2013 using the same process water from the Wolf Burn. The whisky is double distlled and aged in a combination of casks. Wolfburn produces both peated and unpeated malt. You’ll see claims from Wolfburn about being the northernmost distillery in Scotland. Of course they mean mainland Scotland as both Scapa and Highland Park of the Orkneys are further north.Wolfburn Aurora was released in 2016 from 3 year-old Wolfburn malt aged in a variety of casks. Reportedly this means 40% of the whisky was aged in second-fill quarter casks 40% in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels and the remaining 20% in first-fill Oloroso sherry hogsheads. I believe those quarter casks originally held Islay malt (the first Wolfburn whisky was aged in ex-Islay quarter casks) although I don’t detect any peat so maybe these are different quarter casks. The whisky is not chill-filtered and has no added color. It is bottled at 46% ABV. The Internet calls this craft presentation and dogma aside it’s a good idea all around.For what it’s worth the label contains the phrase “Matured in ex-bourbon oak casks for 3 years” but it’s in tiny print at the bottom of the back label. I guess we can still call that an age statement.Nose Resinous slightly rancid sherry with some tannic red wine. Beneath that red berries and caramel malt. A rest in the glass disperses the rancidity and somewhat brightens the fruits. Palate Thin bodied. Robust tongue burn up front which resolves into cinnamon extract powdered ginger and berry jam over a thin layer of malt. Eclectic. Feels incomplete.Finish On the short side. Cane sugar (molasses) and mild oak tannins. Fades vaguely without resolution.With Water A few drops of water wake up the sherry a bit – adding fruit – and also round out the vanilla sweetness in the aroma. The palate also seems fuller and more dynamic. Water highly recommended with this one.Overall This feels like a young malt that shows older on the stage but which has been contaminated by an inferior cask of sherry that left most of the fruit in the wine and presents largely off-putting rancio and resin notes. It is possible to drink this and ignore these elements but the experience seems incomplete. Perhaps older malt left in ex-bourbon for longer would have stood up to or better incorporated the sherry. I was thoroughly lucky to obtain a closeout bottle of this for $30 which is really the exact price point where this belongs. If market forces and industry overhead didn’t force new and craft distillers to overcharge the market would consist of much more good fairly-priced whisky. Alas that’s not the world we live in. I am looking forward to seeing what 6 or 8 year-old Wolfburn is like but I won’t be dropping $50 on any 3 year-old from the distillery.
498,Woodford Reserve Bourbon - Update 9/7/2015 I’ve revisited this review. Click here for an updated review for 2015!Woodford Reserve made by Brown-Forman in Kentucky is Kentucky Straight Bourbon. It’s somewhat unlike other bourbons in that it contains some percentage of whiskey made in copper pot stills and triple-distilled – in the Irish style of whiskeys such as Redbreast. Unlike Redbreast Woodford Reserve uses a mash of corn rye and malted barley and also re-uses some of each run’s fermented mash in the next batch – a tradition called “sour mashing”. This pot-still whiskey is combined with column-still whiskey and aged in new toasted oak barrels for between four and six years. It is bottled at 90.4 proof (45.2% ABV).I’m still working my way through a pile of American whiskey samples. I had heard good things about Woodford Reserve and was looking forward to this miniature. Unfortunately my sample may have come from an overly sulfur-influenced batch as I detected an unpleasant “rotting banana” note in the aroma. I intend to seek out another taste of this whiskey and I will update this post when I do. That said here are my notesNose Banana charcoal a bit sulfured? Green grass in a compost bin. Water intensifies the “rotting fruit” note.Palate Fruity with a silky mouthfeel and dominant notes of chocolate-covered banana creamy vanilla pudding young green oak. Thankfully the sulfur does not intrude. The grain alcohol is milder and more mature than in cheaper bourbons. A few drops of water doesn’t alter the apparent flavors for me.Finish Smooth and medium-length. More wood char and oak tannin fading vanilla bean.While this is quite a decent sip there is nothing outstanding about it to recommend it. Mild and smooth oaky and with that familiar bourbon barrel-char and brown sugar flavors… it still doesn’t inspire me to drink more. I’m also not crazy about the nose – too composty for me. Maybe it’s the sulfur?
499,Woodford Reserve Bourbon (Revisited) - Way back in 2011 when I was just getting introduced to bourbons after launching the blog with the intention of only covering scotch I had a relative stinker of a 50ml sample bottle of Woodford Reserve Bourbon and was called out in the comments by Woodford adherents that I was doing the whiskey a disservice by reviewing it based on the sample bottle. Normally my opinion is that since many people use 50ml sample bottles to try out new spirits before committing to a full bottle it’s on the head of the manufacturer if those samples don’t represent the real product. Still I had an opportunity to revisit Woodford Reserve recently – this time from a full 750ml bottle – and thought it would be appropriate to review it again for National Bourbon Heritage Month. Does my review from 4 years ago hold up?Woodford Reserve made by Brown-Forman in Kentucky is Kentucky Straight Bourbon. It’s somewhat unlike other bourbons in that it contains some percentage of whiskey made in copper pot stills and triple-distilled – in the Irish style of whiskeys such as Redbreast. Unlike Redbreast Woodford Reserve uses a mash of corn rye and malted barley and also re-uses some of each run’s fermented mash in the next batch – a tradition called “sour mashing”. This pot-still whiskey is combined with column-still whiskey and aged in new toasted oak barrels for between four and six years. It is bottled at 90.4 proof (45.2% ABV). My bottle is from Batch #941 Bottle #6643.Nose Toasted marshmallow. Marzipan cherry pits. Candied apple (the red kind). Over all of that is a blanket of paint thinner or fresh plastic.Palate Sweet medium bodied. Almost syrupy. Oak and cashew butter up front then dried apple and barrel char.Finish Medium-long. Continuing flavors from the palate – dried apple nuts oak and barrel char. Fades with slight bitterness some more plastic-like flavors and a little tobacco.With Water A splash of water really wakes up the cherry notes. Fresh tart cherries as well as dried ones. However it adds some extra paint thinner / varnish on the palate and a slight rotten fruit note that fades quickly. Ups the bitterness of the charcoal notes. Try this one both with and without water to see how it works for you.Overall First I should note that my original review was done from a 50ml sample “airline” bottle. This time from a full 750ml glass bottle I thought the aromas and flavor were a little more in line with what I expect from a bourbon. There is a nice balance of acidity from the fruit notes (mostly cherry and apple) and the intense nuttiness on the front of the palate. Unfortunately this is waylaid by what I call “paint thinner” which is really a slightly bitter slightly chemical aroma and flavor that I get when tasting especially cheap (although this is not cheap) spirits. This does make an excellent cocktail where the sweetness fruit and nuttiness comes through although for the price you’re probably better off with a bottle of Eagle Rare (or a Costco 1.5L of Buffalo Trace!).I know there are a lot of Woodford Reserve fans out there so I’ll qualify my conclusion by saying that this bourbon simply isn’t to MY tastes although if you don’t detect the plastic/chemical notes that I get you’d probably find this to be a quite tasty bourbon and worth your money. I’d be the first to admit that my 2011 review was flawed but after tasting from a full bottle I’ll have to stick to my conclusions.Update Check out my review of Woodford Reserve ‘Double Oaked’ here.
500,Woodford Reserve Double Oaked - Finishing whiskey in a second barrel is nothing new. Angel’s Envy uses a port barrel for the second maturation for example and the practice of “finishing” is rampant in the scotch whisky industry. Brown-Forman makers of Woodford Reserve came up with an innovative approach to this old concept Use a fresh new (and slightly differently charred) oak barrel for the second barrel maturation. Mind. Blown.You see as a whiskey ages volatile compounds in the wood react with the whiskey in various and undocumented ways. Some of this is simple dissolving of compounds into a solvent (alcohol) and some of it is esterification and transesterification which are types of chemical reactions involving the alcohol the wood the charcoal and the oxygen in the barrel. At any rate this process occurs on a spectrum of time where certain compounds are released early and others are released or created over longer amounts of time. The longer the whiskey ages the more of these compounds are “spent” as the barrel has less readily-available (near the surface) react-able compounds. If you take such a “spent” barrel and re-use it (as the scotch industry does) you get a different set of reactions different compounds and different flavors that take longer to develop. You can increase the activity of a spent barrel by scraping off a layer of used-up wood and re-charring it to release and activate more of the wood.What Brown-Forman realized is that by taking their standard 72% corn 18% rye 10% malted barley bourbon and re-casking it into one of these brand-new casks for a little under a year you restart the process and get a double dose of those “early” readily-available compounds into the whiskey. Further by heavily toasting and lightly charring (instead of the usual heavy charring) the second barrel you encourage a slightly different set of compounds to develop in the charred surface of the oak. Brilliant. Also expensive… since you just bought one barrel of whiskey for the price of two. But… does it work?Nose Dark chewy molasses cookies or gingersnaps. Intense nutty and with a piercing tart note like apple cider vinegar. Woody; that extra maturation in new oak does seem to intensify the oak aromas.Palate Thin body. Lump charcoal up front almost smoky. Then sweetness shines through with molasses pancake syrup and toffee. Moderate tongue burn (appropriate for 45-ish percent ABV).Finish Of medium length. Very woody with a lot of drying antiseptic tannins. The sugar manages to keep pace as does the not-quite-bitter charcoal. Even that vinegar note persists. Fades slowly without evolving.With Water Several drops of water have no apparent effect on the aroma and simply mute the tongue burn on the palate. This bodes well for its ability to work in cocktails or handle ice.Overall A robust intense and woody bourbon that reminds me of a budget Stagg Jr. but without the proof. This definitely has more depth of flavor than is normally available outside of cask-strength bourbons like the Stagg. The whiskey seems to be missing any fruit notes but manages to maintain a tenuous but successful balance between sweet smoky oaky and bitter. These qualities also allow it to shine through in cocktails.Even though the price is almost but not quite double that of the standard Woodford the quality is in line with other $40-$50 bourbons. I wouldn’t buy this at the higher end of retail (I’ve seen it for $60!) but $40 is fairly spot on and that’s saying a lot for a bourbon. It also comes in a handy 375ml half-bottle if you’re not ready to commit to a full bottle.I like this a lot better than the standard Woodford and would consider buying a full bottle the next time I run out of Stagg Jr.
501,Woodford Reserve Rye - In a refreshing departure from mainstream bourbon brands releasing LDI/MGP rye under their own labels and then claiming some kind of “heritage” of rye distillation Brown-Forman’s Woodford Reserve actually went out and – gasp! – made themselves a rye! After a few experimental batches that were limited releases so limited I never even heard of them Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey was released in 2015 as a regular part of the portfolio at the same proof as the company’s bourbon (45.2% ABV). The rye (like the bourbon) is made from a combination of pot-still rye whiskey from the historic Woodford Reserve distillery and column-still rye whiskey from the Brown-Forman distillery in Shively KY.Unlike a lot of recent rye releases crowing about their “high-rye” mashbills the Woodford Reserve Rye mashbill can only be called “low-rye” 53% rye (the legal minimum is 51%) 33% corn and 14% malted barley. Woodford Reserve claims this mashbill was chosen to maintain the house characteristics familiar from its bourbons and is thus sweeter than most ryes. With no age statement on the bottle and the “straight whiskey” declaration one must assume the rye is at or slightly above 4 years of age.My bottle was #2166 from batch 52.Nose Baking spices greet the nose in classic rye fashion. Deeper in there is a strong cherry liqueur aroma plus marzipan dry corn and a malty-but-not-too-sweet grain presence. Beneath this is a vegetal layer of mild sweet grass and – weird – dill.Palate Medium bodied. Distinct tongue burn (I would have said this was 50% ABV) which starts out dry and slightly bitter and then turns malty and sweet and mildly bitter (fruity bitters though like Angostura or Peychaud’s). Finish Medium-short in length. Spicy with cinnamon red-hots and clove fading into ginger (candied; dried). Not overly bitter on the finish.With Water Several drops of water open up a little vanilla buttercream frosting and some dark sticky caramel notes on the aroma. The palate seems fuller and somewhat sweeter. The finish unchanged. I recommend a little water with this – at 45-ish% ABV it can’t hurt.Overall The aroma (ignore the dill that’s probably just me) is a nice full balance of dry rye spices with welcome bourbon-y cherry and oak. The “bitters” flavors on the palate are interesting – as if the glass were just an ice cube and a teaspoon of sugar away from being an Old Fashioned. It’s unusual but welcome. That bitterness is adequately balanced with oaky sweetness. The finish is run-of-the-mill if on the short side. The occasional green/vegetal note means the batch could use some additional time in oak but the effect is faint and I’m just nitpicking. This is a decent sipper and at a well-chosen strength makes a fine choice for your Manhattans.
502,Woodinville Straight Bourbon - Woodinville Straight Bourbon is a straight bourbon that is pot distilled by Woodinville Whiskey Company in Woodinville Washington state. The distillery established in 2010 was acquired in 2017 by Moët Hennessy (LVMH) which might explain why it’s now popping up on store shelves. All of the grain for distillation comes locally from the Omlin Family Farm. This particular release has a mashbill of 72% corn 22% rye and 6% malted barley (for enzymes) and is bottled at a reasonable 45% ABV. As I mentioned in my review of Woodinville Straight Rye it’s not often these days that I run across a true craft (as in made at a real small distillery) whiskey for under $40 that is excellent for sitting down and sipping.As a Straight Bourbon that does not have an age statement on the bottle it should legally be 4 years or older. How likely is a small craft distillery to follow Federal labeling requirements to the letter? Unknown but anecdotal sources online say the whiskey is 5 years old just like the rye.On their website Woodinville makes a point of discussing the seasoning technique for their barrel staves. Specifically because the oak is air-dried for 18 months instead of kiln dried the barrels are of higher quality and less likely to impart bitter tannins to the whisky. There are other benefits to the lengthy (and expensive) process of air-drying oak for staves but once you go down the rabbit hole of barrel wood science well… I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. Suffice it to say this is a Good Thing(TM).Nose Deeply oaky with buckets of buttery resinous caramel-rich oak sugars. The rye notes also come through as pine sap caraway and clove. Palate Silky body. A reprise of the aroma’s array of woody sweetness plus a new (requisite for bourbon) cherry syrup note. Subsequent tastings reveal a marshmallow note.Finish Medium-long. Classic bourbon. Sweet woody and with a layer of cherry pie filling. These three elements linger together for awhile before fading with a hint of menthol.With Water A few drops of water add even more sweetness to the aroma in the form of vanilla extract. The palate and finish seem unaffected.Overall This is quintessential unadorned bourbon that ticks every box but does not stand out either. There are no off-notes and everything is in the expected balance of corn sweetness and oak. Unlike the rye this bourbon does not offer anything “extra” to justify its craft price. If you already like the rye and want to support the distillery by all means try the bourbon. If you’re price-conscious and looking for a new bourbon know that you can do better for less. Eagle Rare 10 for example is better if you can find it for under $40 and there are many excellent (non-craft) bourbons in the $20 – $30 range that easily stand up to this.I’m giving this a Recommended rating because it’s very good bourbon for less than $40. It’s not a “Must” anything however.
503,Woodinville Straight Rye - I just polished off my bottle of this and I have to start the review by saying it’s not often these days that I run across a true craft (as in made at a real small distillery) whiskey for under $40 that is excellent for sitting down and sipping. Our story begins in San Francisco California circa 2019. I was ensconced in my company-paid shoebox of a hotel room preparing for a nearly week-long conference. Not a whisky conference mind you a boring “real work” one. Before I turned in for the night I decided to do what has become a tradition for me when in a new place for more than a few days Go find a bottle of whiskey for the room.I found the nearest liquor store on my phone and speed-walked the bustling Embarcadero sidewalks to get there before it closed. After eyeing row after row of familiar whisky with prices marked up between 10 and 50 percent higher than I’m used to (ahh the City) I settled on an unknown Woodinville rye from Washington State for $40 a bottle. Back in my hotel I popped it open for a nightcap and was subsequently wowed.Woodinville 100% Rye is a straight rye that is pot distilled by Woodinville Whiskey Company in Woodinville Washington state. The distillery established in 2010 was acquired in 2017 by Moët Hennessy (LVMH) which might explain why it’s now popping up on store shelves. All of the grain for distillation comes locally from the Omlin Family Farm. This particular release is 100% rye with no corn malted rye or other grains in the mash bill and is bottled at a reasonable 45% ABV.How old is it? Well technically as a Straight Rye that does not have an age statement on the bottle it should legally be 4 years or older. How likely is a small craft distillery to follow Federal labeling requirements to the letter? Unknown but anecdotal sources online say the whiskey is 5 years old. The distillery also makes a straight bourbon.A quick note that there were some particles floating around in the bottle. When I’ve seen such things before they were usually black and were likely bits of charcoal or cask debris that escaped the barrier filtering process. These appear to be more like minuscule bits of cork. It’s also possible that these are proteins congeners or other compounds that naturally precipitated (came out of solution) after bottling. They did not affect the flavor of the whiskey and I didn’t notice them while drinking. They also appear in the second bottle that I bought after enjoying the first one so much.Nose Unctuous dripping sticky cherries. Fresh apple cider. A hint of eucalyptus. Some rye spices – clove allspice cinnamon – but in their candied form. A good amount of complexity – there are aromas I can’t name – an appropriate nose tickle and no off-notes. Balanced. Holy crud it’s even better after a rest in the glass.Palate Medium body. A strong tongue burn – tastes more like 50% ABV – followed by a full jar of maraschino cherries including the syrup. Tart fruity spiced. Yum.Finish Medium length. A reprise of the same. Damned if this whiskey ain’t consistent. A little nuttiness as the flavors fade including only the barest amount of not-even-bitter charcoal. Oaky at last but without tannins.With Water A few drops of water – is it possible? – increase the candied fruit notes adding some fruit punch. The palate seems thinner the finish sweeter. Water is not needed here really but also doesn’t hurt.Overall Wow. Just… what? Wow. This stuff is amazing and it’s only $40? And it’s “craft”?! Why has nobody told me about this before? Ok… calm down Noob. $40 is a bit high considering the quality straight ryes available at nearly half the price (Rittenhouse 100 Hochstadter’s) but this is most certainly sipping whiskey. A lot of those delectable fruit and spice notes would be lost or at least compromised in a cocktail. I am happy sipping a glass of this neat in place of most bourbons under $50. If you’ve been of the opinion that upstart “craft” distillation in the United States is a lot of noise and no walnuts then you owe it to yourself to find a bottle of this and get some education.
504,Writers’ Tears Cask Strength (2014 Release) Irish Whiskey - Writers’ Tears a blend from the makers (not distillers) of The Irishman blend Walsh Whiskey Distillery Ltd. is a vatting of Irish single-malt (probably from the Cooley distillery) and Midleton single pot still whiskey. Read my review of the standard Writers’ Tears here for more.I felt about the standard bottling that it could do with less watering-down and along comes a Cask Strength sample for me to verify that assumption! Walsh releases a yearly bottling of the Writers’ Tears Cask Strength (around 2000 bottles a year) with a different label and packaging and it does not appear to ever make it to the US market. The whiskey is aged in first-fill American oak and bottled without chill filtration. The 2014 edition is a respectable (but not extreme) 53% ABV.Apologies that my review is from a release four years out of date but I doubt anyone is going to want to run out and pick up a bottle after reading this. I do hold out hope that recent releases have had better results.Nose Abundantly apple-y with both fresh crunchy apple and farmyard cider. Hot with a lot of grain on the nose and a large-ish helping of vodka-slash-paint-thinner which largely dissipates with a rest in the glass. Some caramel dried coconut and ripe banana. A rest in the glass also reveals a not-quite-bitter walnut note and butterscotch frosting.Palate Medium bodied waxy or oily. Big flavor here – cascades of nuts (pecan walnut) meaty coconut unfiltered apple cider some bitter barrel char and chewy burnt caramel and toffee. The bitterness grows alas as the taste evolves. Quite tame at 53% ABV very drinkable.Finish Medium-long. The black walnut and bitter charcoal persist quite obscuring the rest. Fades unpleasantly with more of the same.With Water A small splash of water has little apparent effect on the aroma. The palate is softer with less burn and arrives sweeter. Still it progresses into more and more bitterness despite the water ending much the same way. The finish carries perhaps a touch of apple that wasn’t noticeable before. Water neither helps nor hurts this one.Overall I would have been upset to purchase this for the suggested retail amount and would not likely consider a different year without solid assurances that batch differences would resolve all of the negatives here. First a nose with heavy amounts of ethanol that must be allowed to dissipate. Second a progressive bitter flavor on the palate. Third a finish dominated by more bitterness. On the plus side the (partial) single pot-still heritage is evident in the coconut notes and waxy/oily palate and the clarity and punch of Irish single malt delivers excellent apple notes. Still Redbreast 12 Cask Strength kicks the pants off of this bottling. I’d even prefer to drink the lower-ABV Writers’ Tears for one-third the cost. Hopefully batches from other years are better.
505,Writers’ Tears Irish Whiskey - This one arrived in my shopping cart with a hefty dose of hype. For years Writers’ Tears was available only in Ireland (or more specifically not in the US) and many a whisky-lover enjoined traveling friends to bring back a bottle or two. This was also true of Green Spot incidentally before that hit worldwide distribution. This relative scarcity relative value and super-drinkable whiskey received both a lot of demand and a lot of industry hype before it finally became available in the US. I snagged a bottle for the very reasonable price of $40 before it sold out entirely.Produced by the same bottler (NOT distiller) who sells The Irishman blend Walsh Whiskey Distillery Ltd. (have I mentioned recently how much I loathe NDPs – that’s non-distiller producer – who use the word “distillery” or “distiller” in the name?) Writers’ Tears is a novel vatting of 40% triple-distilled Irish single-malt whiskey “probably” from Cooley (but the source is unknown) and 60% triple-distilled Irish single pot-still whiskey from Midleton the only distiller of mature single pot-still whiskey — for now! The vatting is aged for an undisclosed amount of time in ex-bourbon American oak casks and bottled without chill-filtration at 40% ABV. Note that The Irishman blend has the same two component types but at different ratios.The marketing codswallop (there’s a word I need to use more often) has something to do with 19th-century Irish writers drinking whiskey to alleviate writer’s block and thus crying tears of whiskey. Cute but irrelevant. They do rightly make a big deal about no grain being used in the vatting (this is only “blended” by technicality it’s 100% barley) which highlights the 19th-century Irish whiskey industry’s insistence on the use of only barley in the face of new blended whisky products coming out of Scotland at the time. Back then fashionable people actually did want whisky that tasted less like whisky and this trend contributed to the fall of the Irish whiskey industry.Nose Reticent nose even after a rest in the glass. Green apple soft caramels a prominent nose tickle (hot) indeterminate nuttiness and a very faint cadre of spices caraway (odd) and clove. Palate Thin body. A lot more flavor than was promised by the aroma; graham cracker brown sugar meaty hazelnuts crystallized sugars but without being “sweet”. It seems a bit austere likely from that vaunted Irish triple-distillation but holds its own with a well-balanced assortment of sweets and nuts.Finish Short. A tinge of single pot-still oils a faint reminder that the category exists but is otherwise lost here. Meaty and nutty with hay and fresh cracked oats.With Water A few drops of water have little effect on the aroma beyond increasing the nose tickle. The palate seems a little confused and the finish acquires only a hint of bubble gum. Skip the water.Overall A reasonably flavorful dram with a disappointing aroma. I could wish they’d skipped the single-malt portion of the vatting and held back on the watering-down. It might have been worth its $40 price tag at 46% ABV. There is a cask-strength version floating around which I’d be interested to try. Writers’ Tears is more well put-together and thought-provoking than a blended Irish whiskey but it pales in comparison to Redbreast 12 which is only $7 more expensive in my state and has an age statement to boot. It has been pointed out that this style of “soft” and (ugh) “smooth” whiskey resonates with drinkers who don’t want strongly-flavored whiskey. If you think Redbreast tastes too much like whiskey then maybe Writers’ Tears is for you.As for me I won’t be buying a second bottle.
506,Wyoming Whiskey Small Batch Bourbon - First Nebraska and now Wyoming! The boom in whisky demand has not only caused distillery construction and expansion in traditional whiskymaking regions like Scotland Kentucky and Ireland but has also led to a new generation of upstart distilleries in unlikely places. Since you can build a distillery anywhere there’s supportive laws and clean natural water sources and because you can basically truck in your grains from anywhere the map is wide open to anyone who can acquire the startup capital.On July 4th 2009 Wyoming Whiskey began distilling in the tiny town of Kirby Wyoming making it the first legal distillery in the history of the state of Wyoming. Determined to do things their way they source all of their grain from Wyoming farms growing Non-GMO corn wheat and barley. That’s pretty cool and outside of an organic one-off release or two from other producers is the first time I’ve seen mention of Non-GMO grains from a whiskey distillery. The water supply is an on-site deep limestone aquifer. The Wyoming Whiskey small batch wheated bourbon is distilled from a mashbill of corn wheat and barley and is aged in new charred white oak barrels for five years (or so – there’s no age statement on the bottle). Then it’s bottled at 44% ABV and retails for around $40.Thanks to Ashley at Wyoming Whiskey I was able to try a sample of their Batch #30 bottled 8/20/2015.Nose Satisfyingly deep wheater aroma – butterscotch and caramel fresh-baked scones and dripping vanilla frosting. The aroma has no characteristics of “young” spirits no grassiness or acetone and at this bottling strength is round and fully present in the nose. After a rest in the glass there is the faintest aroma of dried apricots.Palate A tinge of oaky tannin upfront which is washed over by waves of soft grains with a sweet sugary glaze. Not cloying but distinctly sweet (not dry or spicy). A tad hot for 44% ABV.Finish Of medium length and warming. No bitterness here just echoes of the bakery treats and vanilla notes. Pleasant and well-made.With Water Several drops of water reveal dusty dried apples and blood orange peels and dampen some of the sweetness. The water also tames some of the tongue burn so a few drops don’t go amiss here.Overall An impressive whisky for a seven year-old distillery. A five year-old bourbon with this much sweetness and elegance no spirity detractors of youth and a $40 average price? Yes please! A solid Recommended and if you’re from live in just kinda like or have anything whatsoever to do with Wyoming this is a Must Have for you!Update 9/23/2016 Tom from Tom’s Foolery asked me to take another look at the Foolery and compare it to Wyoming Whisky. Witness the Grudge Match here.
507,Yellow Spot Irish Whiskey - Yay! Green Spot is available in the US! About time too. The softer sweeter lighter cousin of Midleton’s Redbreast 12 year has been enjoying a renaissance in the UK and now in the US. Being the impatient type I couldn’t wait and asked my parents to bring back a bottle of Yellow Spot the older and fortified-wine-finished sibling of Green Spot from their trip to Ireland. Thanks Mom and Dad!Yellow and Green Spot are two of the few surviving “bonded” Irish whiskeys – made by the ubiquitous Irish Distillers Limited (originally at the Jameson Bow Street Distillery and now at the larger facility in Midleton where all IDL whiskeys are made) – but sold by the wine merchants Mitchell & Son of Dublin Ireland. Originating sometime after Mitchell & Son began selling whiskey in 1887 the ‘Spot’ refers to the family tradition of marking barrels of maturing whisky with a daub of paint to indicate their age – originally the shop sold Green Yellow Red and Blue Spot whiskeys most aged in the shop’s excess fortified wine barrels.Green and Yellow Spot are single pot still Irish whiskeys meaning a combination of malted and unmalted barley is distilled together (triple-distilled in this case) in a copper pot still like Redbreast which is also produced at the Midleton distillery by IDL. Unlike most Irish Whiskeys single pot still whiskies do not contain any column-still grain whiskey making this style analogous to (but not the same as) single-malt. Yellow Spot is matured for 12 years in a combination of ex-bourbon ex-sherry and ex-Malaga (a sweet Spanish fortified wine) casks. The vatted result is bottled without chill-filtration at 46% ABV.Nose The Malaga wine cask effect is subtle but effective – soft fruits mildly vinous with a strong heart of butterscotch and buttery caramel. Like Green Spot the cereal notes are in balance and just this side of light. It bears little to no resemblance to Redbreast despite the similar distillation. Deeper in the glass there is an undercurrent of vanilla cake frosting.Palate A bit hot. Sweet but not a body on the thin side. Hard candy port reduction and a ghost of sweetened coconut. Also marshmallow.Finish Medium-long with a nice carrying presence of candied- apple shell buttery oak and butterscotch. Ends slightly bitter with dry wood.With Water Water picks up the nose tickle and adds a bit of red grape skin. Makes the palate and finish a little tannic. Water optional here.Overall The Malaga effect on this whisky is very similar to the port finish on Quinta Ruban – lots of red fruits and candy. In this case it (or the sherry) covers up the essential grain flavors that make single pot still such a fascinating category. While Redbreast 12 (which is far cheaper) showcases the nuts and coconut Yellow Spot (while very tasty and impeccably composed) showcases the wine. Even so Yellow Spot does not disappoint.Any fan of Irish Whiskey must consider Green and Yellow Spot to be mileposts on their journey to discover that country’s whiskey making this a “Must Try” – of course it’s a pricy dram and thus best suited to a splurge purchase or perhaps a bottle split among a few people.
508,Zuidam Millstone 100 Rye - Talk about taking a shtick and running with it Dutch distiller Zuidam’s Millstone 100 rye whisky is made from 100% rye grain (49% malted 51% unmalted) distilled in small copper pot stills and then is aged for 100 months (8 years 4 months) in new American oak barrels and then bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV). The marketing slogans almost write themselves.The distillery was established in 1976 by Master Distiller Fred van Zuidam. A truly family business the packaging was created by Fred’s wife and the distillery operations are now overseen by his two sons Patrick and Gilbert. Zuidam Distillers also makes gin genever rum liqueur and a line of Millstone whiskies including several malt whiskies.I tasted a sample of Millstone 100 rye that was collected from bottle in April of 2015 as part of a Flaviar sample pack (Ryevolution).Nose Very shy even with a rest in the glass. I can tease out a spirity note of graham cracker with attendant cinnamon and clove. As it warms up there is a little cracked black peppercorn and hot roasted almonds.Palate Syrupy body. Moderate tongue burn. More graham cracker a spice cabinet array (primarily cinnamon) and only a faint cereal sweetness reminding me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch breakfast cereal only not as sugary.Finish Medium-long warming. No bitterness just a fading slideshow of spices (cinnamon nutmeg clove anise mace etc.).With Water Water has no effect on the nose alas or anywhere else. Water is fully optional with this.Overall A pretty standard well-made middle-aged rye. The usual suspects (spice notes) are in attendance although they are so muted on the aroma that not much at all greets the nose. The body is unusually viscous and the finish unusually long but other than that you could swap this out with any other not-too-young rye without anyone noticing.I marked this “Try before Buy” because of the price-quality ratio (going by EU prices). That said if you can find this whisky for significantly less this would make an excellent “daily drinker” rye good for both cocktails and sipping neat.
